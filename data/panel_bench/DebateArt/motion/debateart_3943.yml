  "Below are extra information provided by jaay, which may include jaay's
  arguments:


  During the civil war they are approximately 1.5 million casualties reported. The
  emancipation proclamation was supposed to be the intention of abolishing slavery.
  The 13th Amendment was supposed to make it unconstitutional to have slaves or indentured
  slavery. However there is a exception in the 13th Amendment that null and voids
  the entire civil war and reconstruction of the South. I intend to prove that not
  only does the 13th Amendment negate abolishing slavery, but also kept slavery alive
  and well in this country. Which also means that reparations are still owed to the
  African-American community for not just leading up to the civil war, but for 404
  years of slavery and the clock is still ticking."

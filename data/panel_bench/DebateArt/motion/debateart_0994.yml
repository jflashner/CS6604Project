info_slide:
  "Below are extra information provided by Debaticus, which may include\
  \ Debaticus's arguments:\n\nAll of my reasons will be in the arguments, but here\
  \ are my stances. \n1.) Don't submit the avengers to bureaucracy and laws.\n2.)\
  \ Don't force non-avengers to be a lesser state than the avengers. (Pre-homecoming\
  \ spider man, pre-infinity war doctor strange) \n3.) Don't force non-avengers to\
  \ reveal their identities.\n4.) Don't attempt to influence or reduce what the avengers\
  \ can do. \nRULES:\nThis is kinda-sorta roleplay, but pretend that the avengers\
  \ movies were actually documentaries released to the public. (Minus Civil war) \n\
  You get to make one example superhero that is in any circumstances you may want,\
  \ for the sake of the argument.\nPick an avenger to support your cause and testify."

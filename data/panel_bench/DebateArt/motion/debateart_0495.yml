  "Below are extra information provided by mourningeyes, which may include\
  \ mourningeyes's arguments:\n\nI'm trying to prove that the behave from a person\
  \ depends on his learning through life.\nAnd, the response from a person depends\
  \ on their growing context, admitting that one person never stops growing in knowledge.\n\
  A response from a person is what a person does in a given situation.\nIf somebody\
  \ does something, in their way, it doesn't mean that is right or wrong.\nBut, it\
  \ means, that person doesn't know how to do \"better\".\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\
  When I say Do, is not what they do for life.\nDo mean an answer to something, or\
  \ an event starter.\nDoing the best that he can, imply also the characteristic of\
  \ the situation. \nThis means: if he is stressed, and if he not used to the stress,\
  \ his answer would also be different than if he is calm or not. But, it also depends\
  \ if he is used to the stress or not.\nDoing not the best way is also doing the\
  \ best way.\nIf It is a person that doesn't care about doing the things in the best\
  \ way.\nBecause is the way that he learned how to do things.\nSo, it's his own way,\
  \ about doing things in his best way.\nSo, I'm trying to prove:\nIn all situations,\
  \ people would do what they thought would be the best. \nAccording to what do the\
  \ best means (for each person).\nWhen I say a \"better\" way, It means the way that\
  \ the person would be more satisfied with.\nA way that people do, what they do because\
  \ they don't know to do differently."

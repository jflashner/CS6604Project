info_slide:
  "Below are extra information provided by Slainte, which may include Slainte's\
  \ arguments:\n\nDEFINITIONS:\nDiscussing: Any form of public communication\nRace:\
  \ An ethnic group\nSignificant: a measurable quality worthy of attention\nRacism:\
  \ The belief that races (ethnic groups) are as a whole superior or inferior. \n\
  Unacceptable: Not contiguous with social values.\nI am taking Con here. \nPro must\
  \ establish that genetic difference conversations as applied to a race contributes\
  \ to racism to such a degree, that it should not occur. Should not occur is a general\
  \ catch-all kind of like a social embargo. \nCon must demonstrate that genetic difference\
  \ conversations are important, and a social embargo is not necessary. Con may also\
  \ demonstrate there is value in having those conversations.\nComments can clean\
  \ this up as needed. All Kritiks need to be pre-discussed in the comments."

  "Below are extra information provided by Wrick-It-Ralph, which may include\
  \ Wrick-It-Ralph's arguments:\n\nIt's a political argument, so I think BoP should\
  \ be shared toward the ultimate goal of a resolution. At which point, voters can\
  \ give argument point based on who's resolution was closer to their initial claim.\
  \ Con is welcome to deny this and argue for an organic development of the BoP instead.\
  \ \nI'm not picky. \nGood luck!!"

  arguments:


  We understand how the big bang works. We know that space and time came to be at
  the beginning of the Universe. Therefore, If there is a god, Then that god did not
  create the universe because it did not have time to create the universe. We know
  how planets are formed from stars exploding into supernovae, We understand how light
  is created from the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium atoms and how these sustain
  life on Earth(Photosynthesis etc. . . ). Every explanation is completely natural.

  There have been plenty of cases(Flat Earth, Creationism, . . . ) where a religious
  explanation had to be let go for a better scientific one. Yet there has not been
  a single event in history where we had to let go of a scientific explanation for
  a better religious explanation.

  God has always been used to fill the knowledge gap whenever we did not know something
  about the universe. "What created the Earth? We don''t know therefore God did it"
  "Oh a supernova created the planets. Well, What created the stars then. We don''t
  know therefore god. Oh the big bang. Well what created the big bang? Dunno so it
  must be god". Every time a secret of the universe has been uncovered, The answer
  has never been "God did it" We came to be through the process of evolution, Consciousness/mind
  is a product of the brain, When we die, Our body decays and we cease to be. No god
  is required at any step.

  This thus leads to two possibilities: Either there is no god or there is a god but
  that god is useless, It does nothing. At most it might had a part in the starting
  process of the universe but then did nothing since. It has been so inactive that
  there is no noticeable difference between that god and a god that does not exist.

  So out of these possibilities, The simplest explanation is that there is no god.'

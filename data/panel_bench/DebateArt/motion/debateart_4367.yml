  "Below are extra information provided by Sir.Lancelot, which may include\
  \ Sir.Lancelot's arguments:\n\n(Only SkepticalOne can accept this debate. Putting\
  \ this here because it\u2019s impossible to challenge him directly if a debate is\
  \ Rated. \nAnyone else accepts, they automatically concede.)\nDefinitions: \nObjective\
  \ Morality- 1. Right and wrong exist factually, without any importance of opinion.\
  \ \nObjective- (of a person or their judgment) not influenced by personal feelings\
  \ or opinions in considering and representing facts.\nMorality- 1. Principles concerning\
  \ the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. 2. A particular\
  \ system of values and principles of conduct, especially one held by a specified\
  \ person or society.\nDivine- Of, relating to, or coming directly from God or a\
  \ god.\nAuthority- The power to determine, adjudicate, or otherwise settle issues\
  \ or disputes; jurisdiction; the right to control, command, or determine.\nDivine\
  \ Authority- The power to enforce laws, exact obedience, command, determine, or\
  \ judge by a supernatural force or supreme being.\nRules: \n1. Pro argues that objective\
  \ morality cannot exist without divine authority, Con argues that objective morality\
  \ CAN exist without divine authority.\n2. Definitions are for clarification and\
  \ are not absolutes. They are liable to interpretation, should the justification\
  \ be reasonable enough. Conversely, said interpretation can be rejected if it proves\
  \ too absurd or is special pleading.\n3. BOP is on Pro.\n4. One forfeit is the loss\
  \ of a conduct point, two are an autoloss. \n5. The winner is whoever proves their\
  \ side, or supports their case more effectively than the opponent."

  For the viewers who are unfamiliar with anime, dub means watching anime in English
  audio with no subtitles, and sub means watching anime in Japanese audio with English
  subtitles. This will help in your voting decisions. I am on the DUB side (Con),
  and my opponent is on the SUB side (Pro). I will let my opponent make their first
  argument."

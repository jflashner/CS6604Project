  This debate is about whether I should kill myself. I am pro, that I should kill
  myself, my opponent is against me doing so. I ask that voting is fair and based
  on who argued better. There is a temptation that because I am arguing in favor of
  killing myself, that voting against me will encourage me not to. I assure you, that
  you have no influence on my decision. Just vote fair. I''m also requesting that
  my opponent has an IQ of 120 or above (as officially tested) not by online tests
  pandering to you in an attempt to get you to buy your "full results".'

  Chip and Devlin (same team) UK rap clash. Con picks 2 UK rappers to clash,
  cannot include my 2.
pro_side:
  - name: RationalMadman
con_side:
  - name: Sir.Lancelot
info_slide:
  "Below are extra information provided by RationalMadman, which may include
  RationalMadman's arguments:


  Pure skill clash, shut the fuck up, no debating, post 4 songs per Round, minimum
  1 out of the 4 must have each in them (can have 3 from one).

  These are the 2 best Grime artists as of 2023 in an overall/alltime sense of rap
  skill and proficiency. Dont care if you post Drill, Hiphop or grime, keep it UK
  artists only.

  You can pick any 2, try it. NOT MY 2, neither allowed.

  YT sessions allowed even if not on other platforms.

  Give both Arguments and Sources to the overall winner. Give the other 2 points if
  you feel it was a severe win or withhold if not that severe, 2, 1 or 0.

  People vote who spat/rapped better, slicker, superior to the eardrum and closer
  to perfect at landing punchlines."

  'Below are extra information provided by FishChaser, which may include
  FishChaser''s arguments:


  1/10: The low functioning autist/down syndrome etc. having type. These types are
  characterized by having relatively high EQ to compensate for their low IQ. When
  they don''t have relatively high EQ it is for environmental reasons or because they
  are subhuman and not the true type.

  2/10: "The neanderthal". Not literally, but in the sense they are the most brutish
  stereotypically caveman-like intellect. They tend to have IQs in the lower 80s and
  have a rigid way of thinking. They tend to be right wing.

  3/10: Usually female or gay, this type is the opposite of type 2 and type 4. They
  gravitate towards creativity and emotion and usually have an IQ in the 90s. They
  are capable of doing well academically and increasing their IQ or neglecting academics
  and seeming dumb in that way.

  4/10: This type is a more sophisticated type 2.

  5/10: This is the first type that is recognized as above average and is the most
  diverse type. They are in the middle between being left and right brained but can
  lean either way.

  6/10: This is the type that has the highest IQ besides type 10 and 9. They are the
  autistic robots that lack social and strategic intelligence compared to higher types
  but can beat the higher types at math.

  7/10: These types are creative geniuses. Many artists and inventors fall into type
  7.

  8/10: This is where true genius begins. Type 8 always has high functioning autism
  and specializes in logic but doesn''t lack right brained abilities.

  9/10: These types are always psychopaths who specialize in strategy, cunning and
  manipulation and are able to emulate empathy with logic.

  10/10: These types mirror type 5 but are more specifically smack dab in the middle
  of being left and right brained. They also mirror a combination of type 6 and type
  8 because they always have high functioning autism and have the IQ of a type 6 or
  higher. They are ridiculous hyper-geniuses who constantly crave intellectual stimulation.'

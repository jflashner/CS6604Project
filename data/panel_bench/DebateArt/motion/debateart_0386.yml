  *Rules*

  1. The definitions below are agreed to by accepting the debate and both debaters
  agree, by accepting, that all voters must use these definitions when weighing their
  vote and that if the voters do not use these definitions, both debaters will publicly
  request that the mods remove the vote.

  2. All votes *must* have thorough, serious reasons for voting and both debaters
  agree, by accepting this debate, to publicly ask the mods to remove those votes,
  after the debate, if the votes are not serious or thorough.

  3. By accepting this debate, both debaters and the voters (and maybe one day I can
  say the moderators too) agree that any vote that is dishonest (defined below) about
  what occurred in the debate will be requested publicly by both debaters, after the
  debate, to be removed by the mods.

  Dishonest votes include:

  a. Voters claiming an argument was made by a debater that was never made and then
  using this fabricated or exaggerated argument to vote that debater up or down.

  b. Voters claiming a source that was provided by a debater states/shows something
  it does not state/show and then using this imaginary/exaggerated content to vote
  the debater up or down.

  c. Voters claiming a source that was used by a debater for a particular purpose
  that was not the purpose the debater stated it was being used for or voters exaggerating/self-generating
  the purpose/intent of the debater in order to vote the debater up or down.

  d. Voters ignoring arguments made by a debater to claim the arguments were never
  made then voting that debater up or down based on the claimed lack of arguments.

  e. Voters ignoring sources provided by a debater in order to claim the debater didn't
  provide them, or to claim that the sources were not supporting an argument not used
  by the debater to support, or to claim that the purpose for using the source was
  something not stated by the debater to be or to claim that the purpose for using
  the source was one that was fabricated by the voter to be then using any or all
  of these fabrications to vote the debater up or down.

  f. Voters claiming a lack of clarity where it is not obviously apparent and where
  the voter does not specifically explain why it's not very clear or voters exaggerating
  a lack of clarity without referencing content within the debate in order to vote
  the debater up or down.

  g. Voters using ANYTHING not within the debate in order to vote a debater up or
  down.

  4. Both debaters agree, by accepting the debate, that any votes that a) fail to
  address the majority of resolution-impacting points made by both debaters, b) are
  dishonest (see above) or lies about debater performance, or c) are vendetta votes/overtly
  biased will be requested, publicly, by both debaters to be removed by the mods.

  5. Death23, ethang5, and any of their related accounts may not vote on or participate
  in this debate because of the dishonesty section of the rules.

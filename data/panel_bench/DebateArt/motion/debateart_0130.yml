  "Below are extra information provided by Mhykiel, which may include Mhykiel's
  arguments:


  I argue that .999r IS NOT approaching the number 1. Does NOT estimate or round to
  the number 1. But is in fact the same as the number 1.

  By round or estimate to the number one I do not mean the syntactic changing of one
  number to another. And that any rounding that may occur is no different than rounding
  2.000 to 2. They are the same number.interchangeable."

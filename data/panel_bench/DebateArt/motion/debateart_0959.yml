  arguments:


  It is quite confusing why people say 'you can't say that, it's offensive' nowadays
  especially in street debates between left and right wing supporters in many parts
  of the Western World. I am really interested in knowing why someone would think
  in such a way that we must care about human emotion is the result is the obtaining
  of knowledge or truth. Looking for someone willing to debate that we must take into
  account the feelings of others when in search of answer. I stand for the 'facts
  don't care about your feelings' side, the opponent will be against it."

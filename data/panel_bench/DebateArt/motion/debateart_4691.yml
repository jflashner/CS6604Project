  "Below are extra information provided by Sir.Lancelot, which may include\
  \ Sir.Lancelot's arguments:\n\nResolution only deals with the wolf archetypes in\
  \ relation to humans & society. \nEssentially Pro argues that this hierarchy spectrum\
  \ is nonexistent in crowds/communities. These hierarchies exist only in cliques\
  \ and cults. \nThis debate is determining the accuracy of \u201CBro Science.\u201D\
  \ \nSocio-Sexual Male Hierarchy:\nAlpha- Alphas are confident, dominant, charismatic,\
  \ and natural leaders. Highly attractive to women. Alphas are extroverts & highly\
  \ successful in their careers. They thrive on challenges. \nSigma- The introverted\
  \ Alpha. Sigmas are confident lone wolves who do not seek social attention. Immensely\
  \ confident & highly attractive to women as they are mysterious & charismatic.\n\
  Beta- Followers of the Alpha. Betas play safe and avoid risks. They lack self esteem\
  \ and confidence. Betas worship women and blindly obey orders. They are reserved\
  \ and idealistic. \nDelta- The average normal guy. They are hard workers who lack\
  \ drive & ambition and struggle with attracting women. They are society\u2019s worker\
  \ drones who don\u2019t believe in self-improvement. \nGamma- They are unattractive,\
  \ bitter & introspective. Confused with the hierarchy, they fail to follow social\
  \ rules. Unsuccessful in attracting women and tend to be obsessive lovers, stalkers\
  \ & narcissists.\nOmega- Polar opposite of Alphas, Omegas are Social Outcasts. Mostly\
  \ nerds, they are needy, clingy and avoided by everyone. Being undesirable & damaged,\
  \ these social rejects fail to attract women."

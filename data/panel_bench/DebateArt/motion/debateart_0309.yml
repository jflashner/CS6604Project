  BrutalTruth's arguments:


  Pro claims that the Christian god exists. Pro will argue for that claim. Con will
  argue against that claim.

  Mopac is Pro. BrutalTruth is Con.

  Pertinent Information: The god in question is a Christian diety. Therefore, the

  but not limited to, dictionaries) must be definitively consistent with said bible's
  definition of said god."

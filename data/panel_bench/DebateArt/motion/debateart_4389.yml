  "Below are extra information provided by Sir.Lancelot, which may include
  Sir.Lancelot's arguments:


  Resolved: On Balance, consumers should get their movies from Video Rental Stores
  than Online Streaming services.

  Video Rentals: (Blockbuster, Family Video, Hollywood Video, and Bridgeport Video)

  Streaming Services: (Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, and Disney Plus)

  Pro must argue that there are more benefits to Video Rental stores and more disadvantages
  to Online Streaming.

  Conversely, Con will defend that there are more benefits for Online Streaming and
  more disadvantages to Video Rentals.

  (Which ultimately determines which consumers should buy from.)

  Definitions:

  VHS- Is a standard for consumer-level analog video recording on tape cassettes invented
  in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan and was the competitor to the ill-fated Sony
  Betamax system.

  Betamax- Betamax (also known as Beta, as in its logo) is a consumer-level analog
  recording and cassette format of magnetic tape for video, commonly known as a video
  cassette recorder.

  Blu-ray- The Blu-ray Disc (BD), often known simply as Blu-ray, is a digital optical
  disc data storage format.

  (Pro will be arguing in favor of the four video rentals in the parenthesis and for
  the Video Rental industry to return while Con will be defending the status quo and
  the 4 services mentioned in their parenthesis.)

  Rules:

  1. Voters are asked to be impartial while voting.

  2. One forfeit is the loss of a conduct point. Two are a full concession.

  3. The winner shall be who brings forth the most compelling reasons and/or most
  compelling criticisms to discredit the other side."

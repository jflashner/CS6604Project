info_slide:
  "Below are extra information provided by the_viper, which may include
  the_viper's arguments:


  This debate will cover all stages of pregnancy but will not cover cases of rape,
  the removal of ectopic pregnancies, or abortions performed to save the life of the
  mother. It will also not cover legality. Murder will be defined here in the moral
  sense. The burden of proof is shared.

  All arguments given MUST be at least 3,500 characters to prove that both participants
  are committed to the debate. Failure to adhere to this will result in a loss.

  Forfeiting a round will result in a loss.

  To clarify, the first person to forfeit or break the character rule loses immediately,
  after that the rules no longer apply"

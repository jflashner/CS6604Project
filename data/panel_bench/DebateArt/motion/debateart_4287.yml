  "Below are extra information provided by the_viper, which may include
  the_viper's arguments:


  This debate will cover all stages of pregnancy but will not cover cases of rape,
  the removal of ectopic pregnancies, or abortions performed to save the life of the
  mother. It will also not cover legality. Murder will be defined here in the moral
  sense. The burden of proof is shared."

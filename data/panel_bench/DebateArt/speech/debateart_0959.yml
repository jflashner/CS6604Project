  content: 'I thank Athias for giving me the opportunity to partake in my first ever
    debate. I hope we have a great time in exchanging dialogue as well as opinions
    on this matter in an effort to understand better human nature and behavior.


    **Introduction:**\

    It is undeniable that feelings nowadays has taken a more prevalent position than
    truth or information in certain parts of society and among certain individuals,
    where people tend to manipulate fact for their own benefit. Fake news and false
    facts pop up everywhere like mushrooms after a rain and is so commonplace in modern
    society that it is hard to differentiate what is truth and what is false. Why
    do we act and behave in such a way? I believe it stems from our feelings of being
    in the right, an attitude of preserving our own personal feelings that should
    not be violated by fact or truth as it may not align with our emotional response.
    In such, the search for truth and knowledge in modern times has been undermined
    by individuals who proclaimed that such fact is not true or biased merely because
    it is not what they ''feel'' is right.


    **Argument 1**:\

    Emotions or feelings should be kept separate from truth and knowledge as I believe
    can blur one''s reason to think in a logical manner.


    **Argument 2:**\

    People nowadays are too dependent on their feelings instead of looking up facts,
    resulting in sensitive people yelling or hurling insults at others when confronted
    to discussion simply because their opinions do not align with their political,
    religious or personal beliefs. I believe that such attitude and behavior should
    be dropped and the practice of looking the perspectives from both sides as well
    as the reliance on absolute truth and common knowledge instead of dependence on
    personal emotions to guide them through their life.


    I end my opening statement. I now pass the floor to Athias.

  content: '**Opening Argument**


    First, I''d like to welcome Marc1123 to the site and express my intent to making
    this discussion an informative first debate. Now, the proposition over which we
    argue, just to repeat, is "In The Pursuit of Truth and/or Knowledge, Do We Take
    Into Account Feelings?" Not only will I argue in this debate that feelings are
    to be taken into account in the pursuit of truth and or knowledge, but also that
    they''re necessary. And in doing so, I''ll use two premises: **curiosity** and
    **meaning.**


    **Curiosity** is defined as the strong desire to learn or accumulate knowledge.
    Would we pursue knowledge without curiosity? Curiosity is an emotion, or at the
    very least informed by emotion. In a complex series of choices presented to each
    individual, one would optimally take the course which provides some form utility.
    And taking said course would be "better" than not taking it. If one pursues knowledge
    for the sake of pursuing knowledge, then how would a surplus of emotion affect
    that? Accuracy or Logical consistency would be irrelevant because the ends are
    the reason for the means.


    **Meaning.** I won''t presume to give this a definition. What value is there in
    the pursuit of knowledge? And can this value be excluded from emotion? Is there
    no value? Meaning is the quintessential manifestation of one''s self--one''s soul
    even. It motivates; it reciprocates; it validates. There''d be no value in forming
    hypotheses, or conducting experiments without one off the most fundamental modes
    of human existence: the everlasting pursuit of meaning. And meaning and emotion
    are inextricably tied.


    In the next round, I''ll rebut my opponent''s opening argument. Until then, I
    pass the floor to Marc1123.

  content: "Definition:\\\nTruth- The quality or state of being true that which is\
    \ in accordance with fact or reality.\\\nKnowledge- Facts, information and skills\
    \ acquired through experience and education; the theoretical or practical understanding\
    \ of a subject.\n\nThe pursuit of truth and knowledge has long been the driving\
    \ factor to the evolution of human existence throughout history. The need for\
    \ improvement in the quality of human life serves as a our main goal for the search\
    \ of truth and the gathering of knowledge to further our understanding of reality\
    \ and the universe we live in. Simply put, these truths or facts are universal,\
    \ which cannot be changed or altered regardless of space and time. The term to\
    \ describe such truth is 'universal truths'. Examples of universal truths are:\\\
    \n1)Newton's Laws of Motion. They can be applied to any part of the universe no\
    \ matter where or when. Any event or entity will act accordingly to its laws.\
    \ \\[1\\]\\\n2)Law of Conservation of Energy. The law states that total energy\
    \ of an isolated system remains constant. This too can be applied to any part\
    \ of our known universe. \\[2\\]\n\nThe point is, truths and facts cannot be altered\
    \ by feelings or mere belief. Just because one feels a certain way about a fact\
    \ does not mean it will alter to fit the narrative of said person's assumptions.\
    \ If someone feels that gravity does not work or is not realistic, does that make\
    \ gravity useless? No. It does not. Even if everyone believed about a certain\
    \ assumption based on their feelings, it will not change if they do not use logical\
    \ and practical explanations to prove their point.\n\nIn recent times, people\
    \ have become more and more dependant on their own feelings to judge how life\
    \ works around them, even if evidence and facts says otherwise. Example, the formation\
    \ of anti-vaccination movements among populations \\[3\\]. The belief of vaccinations\
    \ causing autism or as a method of 'Big Pharma' to drain every cent of out its\
    \ citizens through the use of vaccines is radical and rather nonsensical. Another\
    \ example is the 'Fat Acceptance Movement' that appears to discouraging the idea\
    \ of standard healthy body sizes and supports the idea of body positivity of all\
    \ sizes.\\[4\\] Once again such movement is absurd and based mainly around supporting\
    \ one's feelings of being unable to lose one's weight and uses said movement to\
    \ assure oneself of being accepted. In fact, both ideas are examples of feelings\
    \ heavily being damaging to both a human's perception of truth and fact, through\
    \ their own perceptions of truth and fact based on their feelings, while ignorant\
    \ to the consequences of being anti vaccinations which resulted in the re-emergence\
    \ of nearly eradicated viruses and diseases \\[5\\] and that being morbidly obese\
    \ just to make you feel good isn't good for you at all as it is one of the leading\
    \ causes of death among human populations. \\[6\\]\\\nSuch is human nature to\
    \ be dependant on our own feelings, it is unavoidable. The very core principles\
    \ of one's humanity in regards to health and well-being can be manipulated by\
    \ one's feelings. One can even say so about truth and fact. Humans are capable\
    \ of blinding themselves to logic and truth if it against their own belief and\
    \ feeling of which is right and wrong. The belief of a a flat earth is an example.\
    \ It goes against logic and the laws of gravity, yet people still believe it,\
    \ despite being proved wrong time and again. \\[7\\] \\[8\\]\n\nAs such, I believe\
    \ as humans we must discard our personal feelings and beliefs in order to pursue\
    \ truth and knowledge. We as a society cannot be blinded by our own biased feelings\
    \ to justify how something works or acts or takes place because it is unavoidable.\
    \ It is inevitable. No matter how passionately we feel about a certain subject\
    \ or matter, we cannot change its reality or alter the truth. Therefore, we should\
    \ not take our own personal feelings into account in the pursuit of truth and\
    \ knowledge.\n\nI will use the last round to rebuke my opponents arguments and\
    \ strengthen my own. But as for now, I end my round and pass the floor back to\
    \ my opponent.\\\nSOURCES:\\\n\\[1\\]<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion>\\\

  content: 'I forego the rebuttal of the opening argument given that many of the themes
    and points of my opponents argument are repeated in the second round. I''ll simply
    rebut the second round''s argument in order to avoid redundancy.


    **Rebuttal**


    > Definition:\

    > Truth- The quality or state of being true that which is in accordance with fact
    or reality.\

    > Knowledge-

    > Facts, information and skills acquired through experience and

    > education; the theoretical or practical understanding of a subject.


    Your definitions suffice.


    > The pursuit of truth and knowledge has long been the driving factor to

    > the evolution of human existence throughout history. The need for

    > improvement in the quality of human life serves as a our main goal for

    > the search of truth and the gathering of knowledge to further our

    > understanding of reality and the universe we live in.


    And what end does this pursuit of knowledge serve? What **meaning** is there in
    improving the quality of human life if it''s not in service to **happiness**?


    > The point is, truths and facts cannot be altered by feelings or mere

    > belief. Just because one feels a certain way about a fact does not mean

    > it will alter to fit the narrative of said person''s assumptions. If

    This should have been the argument you instigated from the very beginning. (It
    would''ve been an argument against which it would be difficult to argue.) But
    in context of the proposition you did instigate, **it is a non sequitur**. We
    are not arguing over that which qualifies, modifies, or informs the truth; we
    are arguing over that which qualifies, modifies, and informs its **pursuit--to
    strive to gain; seek to attain or accomplish (an end, object, purpose, etc.).
    We pursue truth because we value truth. And values are expressed through actions,
    decisions, and emotions.** The rubric by which we establish that which we value
    or don''t is Aristotle''s a priori presumption of the rational human being. We
    engage values and actions which serve a good utility (benefit) and avoid those
    which produce a bad utility (harm.) If we also consider Epicurean philosophy the
    greatest (good) utility is in pursuing pleasure, and the worst utility is in pursuing
    pain and suffering. **So I must ask: what meaning is there in pursuing truth if
    we are to disregard the value (expressed through emotion) we place on it? Why
    even bother searching for it?**


    > Such is human nature to be dependant on our own feelings, it is

    > unavoidable. The very core principles of one''s humanity in regards to

    > health and well-being can be manipulated by one''s feelings. One can even

    > say so about truth and fact.


    **Didn''t you answer your proposition to the detriment of your own argument, here?
    If it is our nature to depend on our own feelings, then must we not take our feelings
    into account in every capacity?**


    > Humans are capable of blinding themselves to logic and truth if it

    > against their own belief and feeling of which is right and wrong.


    You have yet to establish how the two (truth and feelings) are necessarily mutually
    exclusive. Please do so in the next round.


    > As such, I believe as humans we must discard our personal feelings and

    > beliefs in order to pursue truth and knowledge. We as a society cannot

    > be blinded by our own biased feelings to justify how something works or

    > acts or takes place because it is unavoidable. It is inevitable. No matter how
    passionately we feel about a certain

    > subject or matter, we cannot change its reality or alter the truth.


    These are two different arguments. **The first argues the motivation for the pursuit
    of truth, while the second argues the quality of truth.** We are arguing only
    over the first.

  content: "The point I am speaking is that since truth cannot be changed or altered\
    \ by one's feelings or beliefs, I is unnecessary for us to use our personal emotions\
    \ in the pursuit of knowledge and truth. As explained before, feelings can manipulate\
    \ one's perceived sense of what is truth and what is false. The members of the\
    \ movements provided earlier (anti-vaxx movements and fat acceptance movements)\
    \ are clear examples of letting their own beliefs and feelings perceive what is\
    \ true and what is false. To elaborate further, let us break down the arguments\
    \ provided by both movements about their cause.\n\n1. Anti-Vaxx Movement\\\n \
    \  The anti-vaccination movement is the movement of rejecting and refusing all\
    \ types of vaccine-related treatment. It has been identified as one of the leading\
    \ health threats of 2019 \\[1\\]. The anti-vaxx movement, while existed for many\
    \ years alongside the existence of vaccines, has seen a major spike in numbers\
    \ of believers due to a controversial paper published by disgraced ex-Dr Andrew\
    \ Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine with an increase in autism\\[2\\]. While the\
    \ paper has been debunked numerous times by researchers and has even been retraced\
    \ by its original publisher The Lancet, anti-vaxx movements continue to use such\
    \ and other outdated information to explain their reasons to rejecting vaccines.\
    \ This has resulted in an increase in many suppressed or nearly eradicated diseases,\
    \ measles for example \\[3\\].\n\n2. Fat Acceptance Movement\\\n   The Fat Acceptance\
    \ Movement is a social movement seeking to change anti-fat bias in social attitudes\
    \ by eliminating and raising awareness of discrimination towards overweight and\
    \ obese persons.\\[3\\] Simply put, they encourage the maintaining of obese or\
    \ overweight bodies and seek to change social views of fat body = bad for health.\
    \ The problem is, being overweight or obese can and will be detrimental to your\
    \ health in many ways such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes and more \\\
    [4\\]. The movement's reason for encouraging fat acceptance is so that 'fat people\
    \ can feel included in society and not discriminated due to their body size'.\
    \ The problem is these people treat fat bodies as an unchanging factor of themselves,\
    \ as if obesity is somehow on par with skin colour and religion. This is false,\
    \ of course. One can change their own body size through healthy diet, exercise\
    \ and the entalm strength to change. Yet, the movement tells people it is alright\
    \ to be fat, just be the way you are as long as you are healthy. And with a obesity\
    \ pandemic on our hands, these organisations are part of the problem to building\
    \ a healthy society.\n\nThe fact is, people have been blinded by their own emotions\
    \ to realise or even admit their own wrongdoing. As mentioned above these are\
    \ examples of what has happened letting our own emotions get in the way of our\
    \ pursuit of truth. It leads to living a life of lies and falsehoods that not\
    \ only bring harm to themselves but to the people around them. As such, I believe\
    \ we should not allow emotion to guide us in our pursuit for truth and knowledge.\n\
    \nWith this final round, I thank my opponent who took the time to read, analyse\
    \ and find faults within my argument, and now pass the floor to him.\n\n\\[1\\\

    \ how the **pursuit of truth is impacted negatively by one's emotions.** Thus\
    \ far, you've given examples of how individuals attempt to qualify the truth using\

    \ statement--i.e. it is unecessary for us to use our personal emotions in the\

    \ use our personal emotions in the pursuit of knowledge and truth\n\nYou're missing\
    \ your major premise. You're merely stringing two statements together because\
    \ they consist of the same words. You haven't connected your ideas at all.\n\n\

    \n1. Both meaning and curiosity are necessary to the pursuit of truth. Curiosity\

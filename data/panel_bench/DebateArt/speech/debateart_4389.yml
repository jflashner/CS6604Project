  content: "I am going to start off with a Kritik. Nowhere in the resolution does\
    \ it say that a traditional video store can only merchant the types of media mentioned\
    \ in the description. This is a fair assumption, because the examples listed do\
    \ not include Laser Discs, DVD's, Video games (including cassettes) and Audio\
    \ CD's. I reserve the right to argue this point, and that while the stores should\
    \ come back, they can accomodate new technologies.\n\n**Screen Time and Digital\
    \ Gluttony:**\\\nIncreased screen time is a problem, and studies show that it\
    \ is especially having negative effects on children and young adults in concentration\
    \ and in sleep quality.\\\n[Study 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6826265/),\
    \ [Study 2](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2722666),\
    \ [Study 3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsr.13003), and [Study\
    \ 4](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/135/3/e666).\n\n\"Reducing\
    \ children\u2019s access to digital media may actually be beneficial, as it can\
    \ promote more social interaction and physical activity, increase attention span,\
    \ and improve sleep patterns\" [(American Academy of Pediatrics, 2016).](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/138/5/e20162591)\n\
    \nRemoving streaming services, and making that content restricted to an act of\
    \ going out, and choosing what you want, does not invoke any sort of censorship,\
    \ It moderates the access to an activity or content, in a meaningful way. It forces\
    \ the reduction of access to those streaming media services. A low $6m fee for\
    \ something that is detrimental when used in excess, is not a good thing. I doubt\
    \ anyone would advocate a $6 all you can drink service.\n\n**About the Business,\
    \ Jobs and the Community:**\\\nVideo rental stores could be one of the four big\
    \ brands in the resolution, however could also include small mom and pop shops.\
    \ For smaller town or cities, the video store was a journy, to go and look at\
    \ what is available, plan out an evening, get the legs moving, being social, and\
    \ curious. It was a community event. From a social perspective, we have to be\
    \ careful about the consequences of being too locked up in our houses.\n\n[Lin\
    \ et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1002/da.22466) found that frequent internet\
    \ and social media use was associated with increased symptoms of depression and\
    \ anxiety, which in turn were associated with decreased participation in social\
    \ and leisure activities. (pages 333-341). We need to create the social environments\
    \ for engagement, and a video store is one of those chances.\n\nWith the building\
    \ of more local businesses, that local community would benefit, versus the huge\
    \ multinational corporations that stream the content, over the big Telco's that\
    \ then deliver it. There is very little obvious community and local benefit. More\
    \ stores, more job opportunities, more local community development etc.\n\n**Media\
    \ and Delivery:**\\\nAs mentioned above, there is nothing stopping video stores\
    \ in our modern age to adapt to the times. For example, they could certainly rent\
    \ out USB keys with videos on them, with digital locks to prevent unauthorized\
    \ duplication. There is no limit in what type of media access these stores can\
    \ deliver, and they could do it in a manner that is logistically practical, and\
    \ prevent that dreaded case when the store only has one copy of Ghostbusters,\
    \ and it is on Betamax, and you only have a VHS. (Beta was better by the way).\n\
    \nFrom a returns perspective, this would mitigate those issues, because the digital\
    \ rights certificate on the USB, would make the movie expire by a certain point.\
    \ And no need to be kind and rewind.\n\nJust because something is all you can\
    \ eat, does not make it good. Someone has to think of the perils of digital gluttony.\\\
    \nDigital delivery options are still an option at video stores\\\nWe would provide\
    \ a better local community, with job opportunities.\n\nI do agree with Con in\
    \ that there is \"No Need for Video Rentals\". It is certainly not a need, and\
    \ renting them via a streaming service, or a store, is the same. There is really\
    \ no need for it on either side. So because there is no need, lets make the best\
    \ effort for our community and our children, and take these things, one movie\
    \ at a time.\n"

    \ adjust to the times. They created an app in order to rival Netflix, but customers\
    \ found it too slow and laggy. So it ceased to generate any income.\n\nA common\
    \ denominator is that these stores have failed to overcome these issues with moving\
    \ on from the past accordingly and have not responded to consumer demand, so were\
    \ therefore left behind.\n\n**Too Much Media Causes Depression??**\n\n- While\
    \ the studies have good motives, they don\u2019t take into account other factors.\n\
    - Causes of depression are more complex and may be cases of bullying, genetic\
    \ predisposition, and a symptom of a psychological disorder. Streaming services\
    \ are used as a coping mechanism for what the person considers an escapist fantasy.\n\
    \nTherefore restricting these means of access by forcing an inferior product on\

    \ negative in the streaming industry does not imply someone should choose video\
    \ rental stores, especially because of a rental store\u2019s limited options.\n\

  content: '**Enhancing a Business Model**\

    Con states that because other businesses in the same sector have had difficulties
    changing, or pivoting their business model, that means the business model cannot
    be changed. Many a brand and store die with change, and many are nimble enough
    to pivot. With a new focus, and an environment that supports such an initiative,
    speculating on inevitable failure, is just that... speculation. In debates we
    don''t speculate. Now just because the times change, that does not mean those
    changes are for the better. We have learned many times that there is something
    called too much of a good thing... is not good.


    **Too Much Media Causes Depression**


    - Rather than dump study after study, (like the Journal of Affective Disorders
    23 study meta-analysis), it is undisputed that excessive screen time can have
    a measurable negative impact, and that impact is more profound on developing minds.

    - Con says that a product provided by a traditional bricks and mortar store is
    inferior. Cost inferior, yes. Convenience, yes. Those are given, and I accept
    them. However costs and convenience is not the only determination on if something
    is good.

    - Whilst there is a libertarian argument that people should be able to consume
    what they want, and when they want to, this does not apply in many regulated environments,
    like tobacco, alcohol, prescription drugs, cannabis, driving, firearms, purchasing
    of certain chemicals, books, and...... ratings of movies and video games. The
    industry knows that there needs to be curtailment. I am arguing that having these
    streaming services, so accessible, and ubiquitous, we are doing significant social,
    and individual damage.


    **Learning:**\

    You can still borrow documentary media from traditional stores, as well as from
    Libraries. There is nothing to say that the stimulated entertainment Con argues
    provided by Netflix can''t be replicated through a traditional store, or library.


    The real learning, which has not been countered by Con, is in the community development.
    The business value in the small communities. The value in really exploring what
    you are going to watch, and why you are going to watch it.


    \*\*Conclusion:\*\*The tsunami of media is a potential individual and social toxin.
    Pivoting, and encouraging a traditional retail environment, would refocus the
    consumption of digital media, create business opportunities that have long passed,
    allowing small companies to employ locally, and benefit directly. Modern technical
    approaches could still be employed, as stated previously. Extend all other arguments
    not referenced herein.

  content: 'In the totality, a traditional bricks and mortar video rental outlet would
    benefit the community and society more than streaming services for the following
    reasons:


    - Cheaper, easier and more does not always = better. Video streaming is an example.

    - Local communities would benefit directly, including real estate, jobs, and social
    interaction not available from streaming services

    - The psychological obsession and well documented side effects would be mitigated

    - New business models, technologies and approaches can easily mitigate previous
    sector challenges, and failures. Deducing that things did not work in the past
    does not equate to a guaranteed future failure.

    - Content options, and accessibility are not compromised.

    - Multi vertical sectors such as music, video games, equipment rental are available,
    which are not currently provided, or possible with streaming services.

    - It is time society unplugs from the screen, and the art of the binge. They can
    improve community ties, family ties, and their own health by leveraging the trip
    to the rental outlet, with the free popcorn.

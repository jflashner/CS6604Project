    Post statistics:.46% of police shootings was to whites compared to 23% for blacks.For
    unarmed the statistic is 23 whites dead to 18 blacks dead.If there really was
    an epidemic of cops shooting innocent blacks, these numbers should be way higher.


    According to John Jay College, if you are a young white man, and in a police confrontation,
    you are more likely to be shot by police than if you are a young black man


    Reason 2:They are protesting America but they make millions of dollars off an
    American thing.


    Reason 3:It could offend veterans who died for the flag.


    Reason 4:Kolin CRAPernick the founder of the movement praised Fidel Castro, supported
    the hate group Black Lives Matter and wears a shirt with the Black Panthers on
    it, a hate group.

    Did you really just say that. Wow,just WOW. What about the families or current
    veterans.Or how about Alejandro Villanueva, us army veteran, the filthy steelers
    tried to force him in the locker room but he refused, standing alone for the flag.


    > When did the Black Panthers ever become a hate group?


    <https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/ideology/black-nationalist>.
    This website identifies Black Panthers as Black supremacists and a hate group.


    > Why can''t Black people say that their lives matter as well?


    They can totally say their live matter as well, but the problem is how these people
    are protesting the flag.


    > But, you''re the same guy who labeled me as racist.


    I think your racist because you said:"All problems in the world is because of
    the white male"

    So, what you''re saying is that kneeling, which is a form of peaceful protesting,

    room. By the way, have you seen the size of that guy? Seems to me that you''re
    trying to rewrite the script with a fake story because you don''t have a case.


    You said verbatim, "it could offend veterans who died for the flag." Did you not
    say that? As I said earlier, defending yourself doesn''t make you a terrorist.
    The Black Panthers were actually started as a means of neighborhood protection
    against the crooked cops, but I''m sure you knew that...Right?


    I''m paraphrasing, but you say that "black football players are wrong for the
    way they are protesting the flag." We''ve debated this topic before, but looks
    like I''ll have to explain ne more time...(Veterans Told Kaepernick That It Would
    Be Fine If He Kneeled.) Keyword: Veterans...On the other hand, the Star-Spangled
    Banner was written by a well-known racist, and it possessed racist lyrics. Are
    you even aware that the racist lyrics were removed?


    When I say the word (all), I''m actually generalizing. Yes, generalizing is wrong,
    but white people do cause the majority of the world''s problems. Your history

    The Black Panthers are still a violent hate group today and aligning with them

    Even though you''re still pulling faux stats from government sites, you still
    fell short. You said 32 unarmed whites were killed while 38 unarmed blacks were
    killed. It''s simple mathematics that 38 is more than 32. My source, [https://mappingpoliceviolence.org,](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/unarmed/)
    is credible because it actually monitors what law enforcement does, it retains
    the legitimate statistical data, and it keeps reports of violent trends.


    No, the Pittsburg Steelers didn''t try to force him in the locker room. Coach
    Tomlin said that it''s up to each player to stand or to wait in the locker room.
    This story was covered on multiple sports channels, and everyone knows that you''re
    lying. You may want to study the deposition that killer-cop Wilson gave to the
    Grand Jury, which completely different from killer-cop Wilson''s initial interrogation.
    Yes, he surely contradicted himself, and it''s documented. <https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/is-everything-we-thought-we-knew-about-the-michael-brown/article_9639102d-d318-566b-a397-25d735a5d225.html>...So
    what you''re saying is that an unarmed Michael Brown assaulted Wilson, who was
    sitting in his patrol car with a gun in his holster? So...if Brown assaulted Wilson
    while sitting in his patrol car, then why was Brown''s body laying nearly 20 feet
    away from the patrol car when the bullet hit him? Hmmm.


    John J. College? Is this the same John J. College that issued a report that publicly
    noted "Blacks Are Still More Likely Than Whites To Be Targeted By Force." The
    report was noted by Dr. Philip Atiba Goff, and the study compares police departments
    that are registered with the Center''s National Justice Database.


    If you think that BLM is a hate group, then let me ask you something? Who has
    BLM ever killed? Before you start scrubbing the internet for answers, just now
    that (If) a black person kills a white cop, then that doesn''t mean the person
    is tied to BLM. Some people say that BLM incites violence, but you must remember
    that Martin L. King was also blamed for inciting violence in which he never did...Yes,
    I just pre-empted your soon-to-be lie with quote-on-quote Facts.


    You said that "history is not an argument for today." I''m just going to let you
    sink your own ship with that comment. Not to be disrespectful, but for arguments
    sake, if your parents had never met in the past then you wouldn''t be here today....You
    asked, "what veterans liked Kaepernick for kneeling." Your question is gladly
    answered right here <https://theundefeated.com/features/an-open-letter-from-american-military-veterans-in-support-of-colin-kaepernick/>.

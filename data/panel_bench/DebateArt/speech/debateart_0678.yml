  content: 'Thank you to my opponent for accepting the debate.


    I will be arguing this as a political resolution. So our goal for this debate
    will be to see who''s solution to the issue ends up being better. If it is a combination.
    Then voters will have to decide for themselves who put more into the solution
    or if it was equal or neither really supported it, etc.. Let''s begin.


    My starting solution will be to legalize all drugs. I will hold this position
    for as long as my opponent doesn''t change my mind.


    Here are my reasons.


    1. Drugs only cause self harm.


    This is the biggest point for me. A person who does drugs is making a person decision
    in respect to their body autonomy. The act of using a drug in of itself, is not
    an immoral act. Now some people might say that self harm is wrong, but that''s
    not an absolute and we have to look at individual situations. Lets take a look.


    A) Suicide.


    To the best of my knowledge, suicide and the next situation I bring up, are the
    only forms of self harm that are recognized to be illegal in most countries. Suicide
    is the act of immediately ending or attempting to end one''s life. People who
    attempt suicide often have mental health issues that are so severe, that the person
    cannot function properly. In some cases. There are not huge mental health issues,
    but rather lesser ones like depression and this combined with life pressures,
    often leads to suicide.


    B) Self Mutilation


    This is the act of destroying your body in some way. I think this situation gives
    us the most insight into our issue. Pretty much any form of self harm amounts
    to some form of self mutilation, with the exception of mental harm. Now the thing
    that helps us here is that not every form of self mutilation is illegal. Furthermore,
    many of these forms are accepted by society. So using this, we can establish a
    good standard for a norm in relation to drug use. So to the best of my knowledge,
    the only time self mutilation is illegal is when you cause dangerous bodily harm
    that would require IMMEDIATE medical treatment. Such as cutting yourself, or chopping
    off your own limb. Now one might say "wait, don''t gender confirmation surgeries
    apply to that category" excellent question and yes they do. So now we need to
    ask ourselves, why aren''t those illegal? Now some people might not agree with
    those surgeries. But there are analogous examples as well such as plastic surgery,
    and certain surgeries that involve the removing or changing of bodily organs.


    What we ultimately discover when we look at this is that when a doctor is doing
    the "mutilating" we don''t have as much problem with it because there is a professional
    there to make sure that the person''s immediate safety isn''t at stake, even though
    the surgery in question might cause later self harm unintentionally.


    I think what this tells me is that society and the legal system seem to have a
    great deal of tolerance for "slow self harm". That is things that might potentially
    be harmful down the line, but aren''t an immediate threat to you right now.


    C) Conclusion.


    After looking at this. It becomes clear to me that if we can hash out the nuances
    of drug use, we should be able to categorize it based on these standards. Currently,
    I believe that most, if not all drugs, would fall into the category of "slow self
    harm" and I have a precedent by which to say that we "ought to let drugs be legal
    like cigarettes and other forms of slow self harm"


    2. Drugs are a medical issue.


    I don''t think anyone would deny this unless they thought I was double talking,
    so I''ll clarify. when I say drugs are a medical issue. I''m not saying they can''t
    also be a criminal issue sometimes because they can. For instance, there might
    be times where drug use during a trial might affect the outcome of the trial due
    to the circumstances it caused.


    What I''m really saying here is that whether or not there are times when drugs
    COULD be a criminal issue, They can still ALWAYS be a medical issue at the same
    time.


    I think it is fair to say that drug addiction is self evident in our society.
    With that said, we need good ways to fight this addiction. This means we need
    to invest some of our public resources into fighting this problem. It wouldn''t
    be a handout but rather an investment. If we can lower drug use, then we can spend
    less money on the problem in the future. If we ignore it, it will climax and force
    us to spend money on it anyway. I say we take the initiative and stamp it out
    before it spreads any further.


    3. The drug war interferes with medical treatment.


    This will probably end up being the crux of my initial position. It is my belief
    that the states involvement in drug issues makes drugs worse. Prisons are one
    of the best place to develop a drug addiction. Nobody is surprised to hear this.
    We see it on the news all the time. Gangs start drug rings. CO''s try to manage
    it but generally fail and sometimes they get in on the action themselves. So if
    we want to fight drugs, wouldn''t make sense to isolate drug users from non drug
    users in prisons?


    I propose that if we had state drug rehab facilities, we could lower drug use
    in the prison population. The prisons is the last place we want drug use because
    a prisoner who gets released is far more harmful as a drug user than the law abiding
    citizen who quietly smokes pot in their basement.


    Another problem is that the state has historically been horrible about sentencing
    drug users. The 12 step program is just horrible and it''s the biggest solution
    that courts use. It''s even worse for atheists who get sentenced, but I''ll avoid
    that for now because this isn''t a god debate. The point is, that we should be
    trying to find the most cutting edge form of court ordered rehabilitation and
    the dogmatic implication of the 12 step program is keeping us from this goal.


    I would now like to hear my opponent''s response to what I''ve said and we can
    begin to hash out details towards a solution.

    attempt to stick to political arguments without veering too much into the tangential
    philosophy. I will be arguing that most drugs should be illegal; and technically,
    I could focus on one of them due to the title but that wouldn''t be very interesting.


    **My premises**


    Most drugs are addictive chemicals and block psychological inhibitory systems.


    _Fairly straight forward._


    Drugs cause harm to more than the individual.


    _Drugs harm isn''t exclusive to the individual any more than suicide or mental
    illness._


    Most drugs and addictive chemicals are immoral.


    _Following the prior 2 premises I believe they could be considered ''immoral''
    by most standards of morality._


    **Acknowledgement**


    It is my belief that the state doesn''t have to jail people who are guilty of
    an offense. Specific to drugs, I believe we should force rehabilitation and psychiatric
    assistance in those shown to be clinically addicted. Jail time should be reserved
    specifically for dealers and gangsters.

  content: 'Excellent 1st Round. Let''s Move to rebuttals.


    > Most drugs are addictive chemicals and block psychological inhibitory systems.


    I would like to add that not every drug is mental. A lot of drugs affect the physical
    aspect as well. But this statement is correct.


    > Drugs cause harm to more than the individual.


    Drug use itself does not harm other people. The act of selling drugs does not
    necessarily harm other people because it''s no different than selling cigarettes
    or alcohol which are legal drugs.


    The only thing that hurts people is their actions while they''re on drugs. If
    the person uses the drug responsibly, there won''t be any issue. Furthermore,
    if a person commits an illegal act while on drugs, we can already arrest them
    for that illegal act and it was not their drug use that caused the crime, but
    rather their irresponsible use. So instead of arresting people for drug use, we
    should be arresting them for drug misuse at the worst.


    > _Drugs harm isn''t exclusive to the individual any more than suicide or mental
    illness._


    I don''t think mental illness should really apply to this argument because it''s
    something that is out of somebody''s control and we''re talking about behaviors
    here. Agreed?


    As for suicide, it is the same thing that I said about drugs. The act of suicide
    in of itself is not harmful to anybody else.


    Except in the rare exception that somebody jumps off a building and lands on somebody.
    For this case, I would say the same thing I said about committing a crime while
    on drugs. The person did not commit suicide responsibly, so if for some strange
    reason they lived, they should be prosecuted for it.


    > Most drugs and addictive chemicals are immoral.


    They''re only immoral if you''re against slow self harm. Most people are not.
    Most people are okay with alcohol and cigarettes, so there is no reason to hold
    other drugs to a different standard. Even if people don''t like drug use, those
    same people also probably think arresting them is not the solution. It''s a medical
    issue. We can''t help what people do to themselves because they have 24/7 access
    to their body and we don''t.


    > It is my belief that the state doesn''t have to jail people who are guilty of
    an offense. Specific to drugs, I believe we should force rehabilitation and psychiatric
    assistance in those shown to be clinically addicted. Jail time should be reserved
    specifically for dealers and gangsters.


    To the first statement, if there is no crime, then the court should not be involved
    in the first place. The very fact that you want people not to go to jail for it
    reveals that you don''t actually think it''s a crime. I don''t agree with your
    about dealers and gangsters have nothing to do with this debate so let''s leave
    them out of it.


    If drugs were legal, dealers wouldn''t even exist anymore, so if you want dealers
    in jail so badly, then why not get rid of them by legalizing drugs? Then we''d
    have dispensaries with strict regulations. Furthermore, If we made drugs illegal.
    The dispensaries wouldn''t sell every drug because some would get more popular
    and they would restrict their "menu" like a restaurant would. So this would even
    lower the amount of drugs used because if we made drugs exclusive in the dispensaries
    via the will of the market, people will gravitate more towards the popular drugs
    by default. Furthermore, people are more likely to kick a drug addiction if they
    don''t get arrested or sentenced in any way. Forced rehab generally doesn''t work
    and makes the problem worse. People need to be ready for rehab of their own free
    will.


    Would you court order somebody to go to the dentist?


    How about the doctor?


    > I could focus on one of them due to the title but that wouldn''t be very interesting.


    You could do this, but keep in mind that we''re aiming for a resolution here,
    So excluding one drug does not win you the debate, You have to prove that your
    solution will ultimately work better than mine. So if you exclude one drug, then
    I just exclude that drug and My solution was closer than your solution. I made
    this very clear in the description of the debate.

  content: '**Definitions**


    Psychoactive Drug: "Psychoactive Drugs are chemical substances that act on the
    central nervous system to alter mood, perception, behavior, and/or consciousness.
    These drugs include sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, opiates, and psychiatric
    medications. " [1]


    Stimulants: "Stimulants are drugs that arouse or excite the nervous system and
    speed up bodily processes. " [2]


    Sedatives: "Sedatives are drugs or medications that act as depressants and slow
    down functioning of the central nervous system." [3]


    Opiates: "Opiates are depressant type drugs that are derived from opium. Typically
    opiates are used to relieve pain and create a euphoric state of consciousness."
    [4]


    Hallucinogens: "These are psychedelic ("mind-manifesting") drugs that distort
    perceptions and produce sensory images (i.e., hallucinations) although there are
    no sensory stimuli that should produce such images." [5]


    **Stipulations**


    I will not be arguing against drugs with discernably little detrimental effect
    (e.g., coffee).


    As you''ve rightly pointed out, many drugs are not psychoactive. I will be arguing
    against the legality of most psychoactive drugs, as the majority of them have
    severe consequences when used recreationally (such as addiction). [6]


    **Rebuttal**


    > "Drug use itself does not harm other people. The act of selling drugs does not
    necessarily harm other people because it''s no different than selling cigarettes
    or alcohol which are legal drugs. "


    - Drug use harms both the immediate social environment, [7] and the society as
    a whole [8].


    - Why do you believe that selling these two things specifically does not harm
    other people? The cigarette is the single most deadly artifact to ever exist,
    and alcohol consumption is certainly not doing us any favors.


    > "The only thing that hurts people is their actions while they''re on drugs.
    If the person uses the drug responsibly, there won''t be any issue. "


    - Recreational drug use makes people more likely to be complicit, if anything
    this supports my side.


    - It''s impossible to use a drug (like cigarettes) responsibly, the very act of
    smoking or drinking implies a lack of prudence.


    > "As for suicide, it is the same thing that I said about drugs. The act of suicide
    in of itself is not harmful to anybody else.\

    > Except in the rare exception that somebody jumps off a building and lands on
    somebody. For this case, I would say the same thing I said about committing a
    crime while on drugs. The person did not commit suicide responsibly, so if for
    some strange reason they lived, they should be prosecuted for it. "


    - I''d rather not discuss this topic further, I don''t know why I specified it.


    > "They''re only immoral if you''re against slow self harm. Most people are not.
    Most people are okay with alcohol and cigarettes, so there is no reason to hold
    other drugs to a different standard. "


    - I am going to hold alcohol and cigarettes to the same standard. Whether the
    majority of people believe it''s acceptable or not is irrelevent to me as they''re
    simply reflecting current cultural norms. Alcohol is immediately harmful, as are
    cigarettes.


    > "To the first statement, if there is no crime, then the court should not be
    involved in the first place. The very fact that you want people not to go to jail
    for it reveals that you don''t actually think it''s a crime. "


    - Should we abolish comunity service and house arrest? It seems to me many crimes
    don''t warrant jailtime, the doesn''t make them less criminal in nature.


    > "If drugs were legal, dealers wouldn''t even exist anymore, so if you want dealers
    in jail so badly, then why not get rid of them by legalizing drugs? Then we''d
    have dispensaries with strict regulations. Furthermore, If we made drugs illegal.
    The dispensaries wouldn''t sell every drug because some would get more popular
    and they would restrict their "menu" like a restaurant would. So this would even
    lower the amount of drugs used because if we made drugs exclusive in the dispensaries

    don''t get arrested or sentenced in any way. Forced rehab generally doesn''t work
    and makes the problem worse. People need to be ready for rehab of their own free
    will. "


    - Legalizing drugs wouldn''t get rid of the dealers. It would just shift the power
    dynamic of the countries further to the top of the ladder than it ever has been
    before. All of this by making the rich the dealers of the drugs.


    - Addiction adds a new level to this ''hypothesis,'' in this hypothetical future,
    if dispenseries stop selling some drugs for monetary gain we''d be in the exact
    same position we are now. The only difference is the problem would be unsolvable
    due to a lack of legislation against harmful substances.


    > "Would you court order somebody to go to the dentist? How about the doctor?"


    - Sure, if their teeth were posing a significant threat to the people around them.
    Likewise, I would require them to go to the doctor to receive vaccinations.


    > "You could do this, but keep in mind that we''re aiming for a resolution here,
    So excluding one drug does not win you the debate, You have to prove that your
    solution will ultimately work better than mine. So if you exclude one drug, then
    I just exclude that drug and My solution was closer than your solution. I made
    this very clear in the description of the debate. "


    - The title of the debate was: "all drugs should be legal," in order to counter
    this statement I could simply state one drug which is incredibly dangerous and
    justify it being illegal. But that isn''t interesting, so I proposed we specify
    parameters and types of drugs.

  content: 'The reason I asked those question was to get to the heart of why you think
    it''s illegal. The truth is, that drug use being illegal does not fit into other
    things that we''ve made illegal.


    My problem is that I think you want drugs to stay illegal only because it''s the
    norm. You admit yourself that it''s a medical issue. You admit that making it
    illegal has inherent risks, but you ignore what that implies. So you agree with
    every reason for making it legal, and yet you seem to tacitly want it to be illegal
    because you want to hang on to some idea that this just HAS to be a good idea.


    The fact is that historically, America did not fight drugs and did just fine.
    Prohibition was the great reminder that you can''t stop people from hurting themselves.
    The drug war has made the same mistake as prohibition and the bootleggers are
    still here. History has repeated itself.


    Our society has created a new wave of Al Capones. We need to learn from the mistakes
    of the past and go with what actually works.


    I would urge you and the voters to ponder upon what the purpose of jail is. What
    the purpose of calling something a crime is.


    Jail is to protect society from dangerous people, it is not a form of drug rehab.
    Crimes need victims, you cannot be a victim of yourself because it''s 100% censual.


    You''re wrong that I can''t argue for all drugs. Arguing for all drugs supports
    all lesser resolutions. You haven''t given me much reason to step down to a lower
    resolution because you''re not acknowledging that you can have what you want in
    a compromise. You admit the truth of things I say and then double talk and say
    that you still want to keep your position.


    The fact is, if you made drugs legal, all of the people that you still want arrested
    under your view will still be arrested, so what''s the problem?


    I implore you to consider the fact that you''re married to this tradition of considering
    drugs immoral. Is it for biblical reasons? I don''t mean to make this biblical,
    but I don''t think god condemns drug use.


    I implore you to look at this without your worldview for a moment to better empathize
    with the drug users and even the dealers sometimes and I think when you pull yourself
    back in and really think about it, you can realize that we can both get what we
    want here.

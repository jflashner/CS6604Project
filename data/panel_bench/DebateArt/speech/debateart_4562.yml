  content: 'Christianity purports stories of Jesus, The Messiah. God, but in The Living
    Flesh.\

    Jesus cannot be the Messiah because he does not meet the Jewish criteria.:


    - The Messiah has to be a direct descendant of David. Jesus has no mortal father.

    - The Messiah was supposed to create the Third Temple of Israel. Jesus did not
    accomplish this.

    - The Messiah is supposed to bring peace on Earth. Jesus also failed to accomplish
    this.

  content: 'Upon reading Wikipedia after doing a Google search, the following says
    "**Judaism emphasizes the Oneness of God and rejects the Christian concept of
    God in human form**. While Christianity recognizes the Hebrew Bible (called the
    Old Testament by Christians) as part of its scriptural canon, Judaism does not
    recognize the Christian New Testament."


    The topic title uses the word"contradiction". Let that be the term to note.


    Contradictions only exist in the same position. Judaism and Christianity are two
    different positions.


    Like North and South are in two different positions. They don''t contradict as
    they''re separate directions.


    If I''m standing or going towards my north and then you say I also am going towards
    my south, you''re voluntarily contradicting the two separate directions that have
    no conflicting nature.


    You likewise do this with two theistic positions different in nature.


    You decide to do this upon your faulty rationalization.


    If I say my south is the same as my north, then I''m contradicting my own viewpoint
    or in this case, vantage point.


    Likewise labeling myself Christian with Judaist views .


    I believe in the doctrines of Jesus while not believing in the new testament at
    all.


    Contradictions are within the same position. Contradictions are not differences
    between different positions. They''re just differences period.


    I call myself a Christian, you call yourself one. People know I believe in all
    the bible. People would not think you wouldn''t believe in any of it on account
    of you calling yourself Christian.


    You being a Christian and telling people you don''t believe in Christ or the teachings
    thereof is a contradiction.


    This is what I basically had to establish from the get go just off the title alone.


    From looking at what you had to say, you perhaps just outlined the religious contrast.


    The religious contradictions would be a Christian accepting homosexuality as righteous
    before God.\

    Another would be "Chris-lam".


    Two Christians may have these antithetical views.


    I understand there''s different denominations. The key term there is "different".
    It has to be in the same denomination.


    Within a single situation, same space, same time are where conflicts are identified.

    \ that believe they're are chosen or saved will not believe those practicing Judaism\

    \ If one Christian believes the whole bible, believes in hell while another Christian\

    You apparently have a different meaning for what a Christian would be. Let me
    just outlined probably once more upon me identifying a Christian. What constitutes
    a Christian for example is the one I''m identifying as whom believes all of the
    bible.


    Given that a Judaist does not, we''re outlining two different positions.


    "So even though the two existed at different times, Christianity cannot exist
    without Judaism."


    This goes back to the meaning of Christianity you''re using. In terms of organized
    religion by man is one thing. In terms of the essential beliefs, both are not
    interchangeable and are completely separable. One is not dependent on the other.


    You''re under the impression one came first and gave birth.


    This is not so in terms of core beliefs. Again , the old testament shadowed much
    of what was to come in the new covenant to include the Messiah.


    You got Isaiah 7 old testament, Isaiah 9 old testament, Deuteronomy 18, Zechariah
    12, 2 Samuel 7, all old testament.


    You''re not really putting effort in challenging everything from my side particularly
    scripturally.


    "However, The Bible claims Eve is Adam''s first wife. Judaism says it was Lilith.
    This is a significant contradiction."


    Until you change your foundation of Judaism and Christianity being interchangeable,
    everything will just appear contradictive to you.


    An oak tree and a pine tree will not be distinctive or individual as far as you
    are concerned. They''re one in the same.


    You just have an erroneous foundation from the start.


    "My example is referring to the character.


    Extend all previous arguments and sources about The Messiah and Judaism/Christianity."


    My point exactly. You''re not really challenging what I''m saying. You respond
    with "my example is" this and that''s what it is . It''s just you said what you
    said kind of deal like you have nothing really to rebut .


    You didn''t refute that Judaism involves people only accepting part of the biblical
    scriptures. You didn''t really address that the beliefs classified under the title
    Christianity was not subsequent due to Judaism.


    You just reiterated or emphasized one came before the other. Your responses are
    short along with only 3 rounds.


    I don''t know if you just didn''t have that much knowledge on the topic or was
    not prepared to be taken up on the challenge.


    It''s a wrap.

  content: '**Heath Ledger''s Joker is spectacular**\

    The custom of green hair, smudged makeup, face scars, and bright red lipstick
    accompanied with Ledger''s manic and ghastly performance, chiefly his nefarious
    laughs, exemplifies evil. The character is extremely well written. He is a pathological
    liar, perverted and brutal murderer, and pure sociopath. The character''s origins
    are never revealed, although his motivation is: he engages in evil simply for
    the amusement and satisfaction of it. Describing the Joker, Batman''s butler says


    > "Some men aren''t looking for anything logical. They can''t be bought, bullied,
    reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."


    In order to defeat this archetypal villain, Batman acts in way he himself abhors.
    He allows other to sacrifice and takes responsibility for death, and violates
    rights in order to save people. Batman is the only one who can do these things
    and ultimately save the city because he is the alter ego of another man.

  content: 'My movie of choice is


    Batman: Gotham Knight


    <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_Gotham_Knight>


    Whats special about this movie is the morality of Batman and different views on
    how people in Gotham see Batman.


    Batman''s morality is shown when he gains new equipment called "Deflector device".\

    Equipment seems good at the start. Deflector device deflects bullets, making Batman
    practically immune to bullets and unkillable. However, in one case when it was
    used, deflector device deflected a bullet to another person and almost killed
    that person.


    Batman returned the device to its producer and said:\

    "It works too well: I''m willing to put my life on the line to do what I have
    to. But it has to be mine, no one else''s."


    Batman stopped using deflector device and gave up on being immune to bullets,
    because using such device can cause harm to others even if it protects Batman.


    Batman simply doesnt want to kill others, even if he has to get killed to uphold
    that standard.


    Awesome display of morality.

    \ Knight_ is a top-notch live-action film. The themes of moral ambiguity, as already\
    \ mentioned, and cynicism along with dark lighting and a plot centered on criminal\
    \ mayhem and a heroic vigilante solidify the film's classification as Neo-noir,\
    \ a noteworthy and rare accolade for a superhero movie. Inspired by Michael Mann\u2019\
    s _Heat_, Christopher Nolan decided to film his movie in a real city: Chicago,\
    \ Illinois. The soundstage was forgone by this director. All of the effects, people,\
    \ and backgrounds are real. The thrilling semi-truck flip actually happened. Through\
    \ these techniques, Gotham and the move as a whole feels authentic and gritty,\
    \ unlike my opponent' animated choice. While _The Dark Knight_ thrives to be as\
    \ realistic as possible, _Batman: Gotham Knight_ accepts its fake and dull optics.\n"

  content: 'The Dark Knight does have good graphic. However, Gotham Knight also has
    good graphic, even if animated.


    Gotham Knight captures not just complete opposite mentalities of some characters,
    but also many different mentalities, some closer to good, others closer to evil.


    Certain character hated and criticized Batman, only to end up being saved by Batman
    and that showed him that he needs Batman.


    The entire Gotham Knight movie is filled with diversity. Some characters are insane.
    Some are small criminals. Some are professional killers. Some are greedy buisnessmen.
    Some are dedicated detectives. Some are innocent victims. Some are cult leaders.
    Some are gang leaders. Some are spiritual people who cant seem to be bothered
    by problems of this world.\

    There is justice, but also forgiveness. There is a display of both criminals and
    innocents suffering in that world.\

    Within that all, there is Batman. He is not some unchangable hero, but always
    grows and develops his views. He makes mistakes and he learns.

  content: 'My opponent admits that moth films have good graphics for their respected
    formats. I poset that live action is a superior formate and, therefore, _The Dark
    Knight_''s graphs are better. _Gotham Knight_ is filled with characters that are
    easily sorted into the good or evil category. They are simple. _The Dark Knight_''s
    characters, especially DA Harvey Dent and Commissioner Gordon, are not easily
    sorted. They have a just cause and good motives, although they act in morally
    questionable ways.

    I take issue with this claim, since gotham knight has many characters that cannot
    be exactly sorted into good or evil.


    For example, Batman meets men at the sewers.\

    He says to them: "I am looking for a monster."\

    They answer: "We are all monsters here".\

    Those men dont exactly do anything good or bad in the movie, yet they label themselves
    as monsters.


    There is also a buisnessman of questionable values, who might or might not have
    killed a woman that was protesting against him. It is a mistery.


    Then there is a boy in the gang who doesnt seem exactly bad. In fact, he just
    seems like he was forced into a gang, rather than being evil. Batman helps him
    after he was wounded.


    Then there is Batman himself, who is considered evil by many. In fact, even cops
    try to track him down.


    "He is a vigilante."


    "No, he is not"


    There are many levels of insanity, and mass confusion about Batman in Gotham Knight.

    \ the chemical attack \u201CDon't Attack Syria-an attack will only bring trouble\

    \ Trump campaigned against.{1}\n\n{--WRONG PLACE TO BOMB--}\\\nThe very air base\
    \ that Trump bombed was protecting a Christian town that was under attack by ISIS\
    \ almost every day and destroyed churches. By doing that, Trump is helping ISIS\

    \ al-qaeda. Trump helped jihadists. The first airstrike Trump did in Syria killed\

    First of all in the 2013 attack, Syrian rebels in the Darra district admitted\
    \ to committing the atrocity. So we know that they have chemical weapons as well\
    \ as why should Assad commit this atrocity? He is winning the war and is in a\
    \ perfect position. It makes no sense to kill civilians. At this point he took\
    \ Aleppo. The area where the chemical weapon attack took place, the rebels took\
    \ defeat and agreed to leave out of the are in 2 weeks.The stage is set and in\
    \ favor for the rebels for committing this.\n\nA rebel chemical factory was discovered\
    \ in the same region where the attack happened and found the very same chemical\
    \ weapon materials used in the attack. The military of Syria warned civilians\
    \ of a chemical attack from the rebels. James Mattis, Secretary of Defense admitted\
    \ that there was no evidence Assad did the attack.{4}\n\n1.<http://time.com/4730219/syria-missile-attack-donald-trump-tweets/>\\\

    website, so I apologize


    point 1. Syria was winding down as a war. Aleppo was liberated and ISIS was starting
    to collapse. This made things WORSE. A "warning strike" means nothing when Russia
    is backing you up.


    point 2. No. This was a CAMPAIGN promise. He PROMISED he would stop intervention
    in foreign countries,but he didn''t. He didn''t simply just evolved.


    MSNBC interview 2016 Reporter asks Trump-"Should the US continue intervention
    in Syria?." Trump replies-"What, are we gonna start WW3 over Syria. NO"


    point 3. It was the Christian city of Mhradeh. A church was bombed.{1}


    point 4. Ok you tell me this. The Rebels were LOSING. They admitted they were
    behind the 2013 attack.{2}. And ASSAD was winning, and was on offense. WHY would
    ASSAD ever think for a trillionth of a second to poison their OWN people. Another
    attack was founded in 2018 which there was undeniable evidence the Rebels did
    it. Whats the evidence ASSAD did it huh tell me. You didn''t respond to MY evidence
    the rebels did it.

    \ attack. NOTHING. There was another round of chemical attacks the very next year.\n\
    \npoint 2.It doesn't matter if pressured by advisors or not. He promised he would\
    \ rain the swamp which he din't int that area. It was a PROMISE. he was hypocritical,\
    \ no denying that.\n\npoint 4. It don't matter, they were jihadists. Rebels were\
    \ jihadists. Jabhat Nusra, Syria\u2019s homegrown Salafi-jihadist group, has important\
    \ links to al-Qaeda affiliates and demonstrates a higher level of effectiveness\
    \ than many other rebel groups. Jabhat Nusra has demonstrated sensitivity to popular\
    \ perception and they are gaining support within Syria. The emergence of indigenous\
    \ Salafi-jihadist groups such as Jabhat Nusra is far more dangerous to the long-term\
    \ stability of the Syrian state than foreign jihadist groups because it represents\
    \ a metamorphosis of a Salafi-jihadist ideology into a domestic platform that\
    \ is able to achieve popular resonance.\n\nNo evidence for ASSAD doing war crimes\
    \ nor responsibility for chemical weapons attack. The media literarily used a\
    \ little boy as a war crime for ASSAD when his own father supported ASSAD. The\
    \ media said that a little girl was running away from ASSAD bombs but it was a\
    \ music video cover.\n"

    Un Secretary called Idlib province the biggest hot bed for terrorists since North
    Pakistan in the 90''s.


    I said no evidence for the chemical attack


    AHH YES, good one. The government committed crimes ok. But so did the rebels.
    ITS right there in your source and its a lot more than ASSAD.


    "On 20 March 2012, [Human Rights Watch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Watch)
    issued an open letter to the opposition (including the FSA), accusing them of
    carrying out kidnappings, torture and executions, and calling on them to halt
    these unlawful practices. In July 2012, the [Daoud Battalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Daoud_Battalion&action=edit&redlink=1),
    operating in the [Jabal-al-Zawiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jabal-al-Zawiya&action=edit&redlink=1)
    area, reportedly used captured soldiers in [proxy bombings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_bomb).
    This involved tying the captured soldier into a car loaded with explosives and
    forcing him to drive to an Army checkpoint, where the explosives would be remotely
    detonated."\

    AND SO SO MUCH MORE.


    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESWCzPy7SgQ>. See the beach part. Woman can NOT
    do anything like that under Sharia Law. Syria looks peacful and you look at Idlib
    and its a disaster.

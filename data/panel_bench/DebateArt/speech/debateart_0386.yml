    \n***God Has Power Over Nature***\n\nBeing that god played a crucial role in the\
    \ origin of life on earth, was central to the formation and structure of the earth,\
    \ controls our days and nights, maintains our habitable position in the universe,\
    \ indirectly or directly provides all metabolizable energy to every organism on\
    \ earth, controls all existing food webs, controls the water cycle, and controls\
    \ the seasons, **god has power over nature**.\n\nIn fact, without god, none of\
    \ these archetypes of nature could even exist on earth.\n\n**The Origin of Life\
    \ on Earth**\n\nAbiogenesis explains that with an atmosphere, water salinity,\
    \ inorganic compounds, volcanic activity, electricity, and [energy from god](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet)\
    \ likely of a prebiotic earth, inorganic compounds can naturally become organic\
    \ compounds in the form of amino acids.\\\nResearchers have used CH4, C2H6, NH3,\
    \ H2S and god's energy and yielded alanine, glycine, serine, glutamic acid, aspartic\
    \ acid, and cystine which are the building blocks of life.\\\nTherefore, god was\
    \ central to the origin of life on earth.\\\n[Primordial Synthesis - Using Arrays\
    \ of God's Energy](http://www.pnas.org/content/108/14/5526.long)\n\n**The Formation\
    \ and Structure of the Earth**\n\nAs god shook and mixed the dust from which the\
    \ earth formed, god allowed iron to coalesce, which began forming the globular\
    \ structure of the earth.\\\nWith god's massive energy and influence, the earth\
    \ became one of the terrestrial planets.\\\n[Exploring the System of God](https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/our-solar-system/in-depth/#structure_otp)\n\
    \n**Our Days and Nights on Earth**\n\nOur day-night cycle is completely based\

    \ time using god.\\\n[God's Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time) &\
    \ [A Godly Day](http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Solar+Day)\n\n**Our Habitable\
    \ Position In The Universe**\n\nGod uses the right mix of elements to protect\
    \ the earth from the dangerous spiral arms of the galaxy and allows the earth\
    \ to maintain a sufficient distance from the galactic center so that it is not\
    \ disrupted by its gravitational forces or susceptible to too much radiation in\
    \ order to maintain our habitable position in the universe.\\\n[Universe Today\
    \ - God](https://www.universetoday.com/16338/the-sun/)\n\n**Metabolizable Energy\
    \ & Food Webs**\n\nGod's energy radiates so intensely that it provides metabolizable\
    \ energy to autotrophs, feeding us and maintaining all food webs.\\\nFor those\
    \ food webs using the earth's heat and chemosynthetic metabolism, god is providing\
    \ the energy to them to from god's intense radiation.\\\n[God and Trophic Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_web#Trophic_levels)\n\
    \n**The Water Cycle**\n\nGod drives the water cycle, heats water in oceans and\
    \ seas, and allows for evaporation.\\\n[Water Cycle - Description With God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle#Description)\n\
    \n**The Seasons**\n\nGod's intense power attempts to reach all of us equally,\
    \ but we live on a tilted oblate spheroid, so while god's trying to be all perfect\
    \ sending god energy, we're being all imperfect and slanted, and this connection\
    \ controls the seasons.\\\nThanks god.\\\n[Season - A Division of a Trip About\
    \ God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season)\n\n***God Has Power Over Human Fortunes***\n\
    \nFarmers utterly rely on god to provide them with enough energy to grow crops,\
    \ feed their families, and make money from their harvests.\\\nHow are we going\
    \ to have great fortune if we don't have anything to eat?\\\nHumans' fortunes\
    \ are contingent on god directly/indirectly providing the light and energy to\
    \ our companies, farms, and homes.\n\nEven further to this point, not only was\
    \ the origin of life contingent on god's existence, but human's current existence\
    \ and therefore any future human fortune CANNOT happen without god's power.\\\n\
    If earth does not maintain a habitable position in the universe, as god is allowing\
    \ for now, then humans are done.\n\nWithout a future, there is no fortune.\\\n\
    Without god, there is no human fortune.\n\n***Humans Depend On God To Live***\n\
    \nGiven that god has power over EVERYTHING humans need to live, including a habitable\
    \ position in the universe, water, and food, humans not only depend on god to\
    \ live, but they could not exist without god.\\\nDone.\n\n***God***\n\nBeing that\
    \ I'm a [heliolater](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/heliolatry),\
    \ I worship god for everything it has done, is doing, and will do for me.\\\n\
    In heliolatry, our god is the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, and we worship it\
    \ for its **superhuman capabilities,** its **power over human fortunes**, and\
    \ the fact that **humans depend on it to live.**\n\nI don't like to use the word\
    \ sun, praise be unto hydrogen, because I have to say that phrase every time.\\\
    \nSo I just call it god.\n\nCon?\n"

    \ this fact, through\nscience, about every physical thing around us. There is\
    \ not a physical thing that we observe that is believed to have\ncreated itself.\n\
    \nOne can ask these basic questions\nabout every physical thing we observe\u2014\
    \ how did it come into existence? It could not have created itself, so WHAT\n\
    created it?\n\nAs stated, when one asks this\nquestion repeatedly of everything,\

    \ (Reminds me of that Rocky & Bullwinkle quip, \u201CWassamatta\nU.!\u201D). \u201C\
    What created matter?\u201D\n\nWell, when one asks the question \u201CWhat\ncreated\
    \ matter?\u201D, it\u2019s reasonable to use our experience about everything else\n\
    we observe, via science, and draw the following conclusion \u201CMatter could\
    \ not\nhave created itself because, as we witness around us, a physical thing\
    \ can not\ncreate itself. It\u2019s reasonable to deduce\nthat this would apply\
    \ to \u201Cmatter\u201D itself.\u201D\n\nTherefore, \u201Cmatter\u201D could not\
    \ create\nitself. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that\nwhatever created matter\
    \ must be \u201Cim-material\u201D (i.e. not composed of\nmatter). In fact, what\
    \ created the\nuniverse must exist OUTSIDE the universe (how would it be part\
    \ of the universe\nand create the universe?).\n\nThe sun is a physical entity\
    \ in this\nuniverse. It is composed of matter, as\nis other physical entities\
    \ in this universe. As shown above, the \u201Csun\u201D could not have created\
    \ itself. Nor could hydrogen.\n\nWhile it is true God has power over\nnature,\
    \ why is that? Is it because maybe\nGod created nature?\n\n- Did the sun create\
    \ nature? No\n- The Sun, though powerful, is still\n  subject to the laws of physics\
    \ as well as the theory of relativity. These physical laws/theories bind things\n\
    \  within this universe. In other words, physical\n  objects in this universe\
    \ (me, you...the car...the surfer...and yes, the Sun) are\n  bound by the laws\
    \ of physics\n\nYour origin of life on Earth is\nflawed. The sun may have simply\
    \ just provided the right temperature/pressure for life to begin, that in no way\
    \ can be translated into \"The Sun created life\". That would be like saying the\
    \ oven \"made the cake\"-- it just simply provided the right environment. In addition,\
    \ timply because science has\nreplicated the building blocks of earth, this in\
    \ no way proves that is HOW life\noriginated on earth. I can construct an Atari\
    \ video game in my garage....that\ndoesn\u2019t prove my way was the way the original\
    \ video game was constructed.\n\nYour theory on the formation and structure\n\
    of the Earth is appealing. However,\nwhile it might explain the earth and it\u2019\
    s formation, it fails to explain the\nformation of other physical objects outside\
    \ our solar system. Nor does it explain things that have\nnon-physical existence,\
    \ like thoughts, ideas, and concepts.\n\nJust because we schedule our\ndays/nights\
    \ around the rotation of the earth to the sun, it the beginning it\nwas done out\
    \ of necessity. Now, with the\nadvent of technology, it\u2019s more of a convenience.\

  content: "**Round 2**\n\nThanks for that response Con.\\\nCon seems to spend a lot\
    \ of time discussing the creation of matter, the creation of nature, and the creation\

    \ to the resolution.\\\nBut, I've got 10,000 characters, and it's time to rebuttal.\n\
    \n***Matter***\n\nPardon the irony, but this portion of Con's argument, well,\
    \ doesn't matter.\n\nThe sun, praise be unto hydrogen, just needs to be worshiped\
    \ as having power over nature and human fortunes to be considered god, so how\
    \ matter is created or not is irrelevant to whether or not god is worshiped for\
    \ particular characteristics.\\\nWhat's more important is whether or not the god\
    \ of heliolatry exists, affirming half of my burden.\n\nCon begins:\n\n> \"Allow\
    \ me to lean on Aquinas, et al, a bit here.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nOk, allow me\
    \ to lean on the definition of god here, which mentions a superhuman existence\
    \ **worshiped** for having power over nature and human fortunes, so let's try\
    \ to stay relevant here, ok?\n\nCon naively continues:\n\n> \"What created matter?...what\
    \ created the universe must exist OUTSIDE the universe...the sun is a physical\
    \ entity in this universe...the Sun, though powerful, is still subject to the\
    \ laws of physics.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nFirst, Con **concedes here that god exists**\
    \ as a physical entity in the universe, so this **concession**, directly related\
    \ to the part of the resolution \"God exists,\" cannot be overlooked by voters.\n\
    \nSecond, what created matter is IRRELEVANT to the existence of a superhuman being\
    \ worshiped for its power over nature and human fortunes.\\\nCreating matter,\
    \ resisting physics, and existing outside of the universe are all NOT characteristics\
    \ of the agreed-to definition of god in this debate.\n\nGod is worshiped?\\\n\
    Check.\\\nHumans depend on god to live?\\\nCheck.\\\nThese two points I just made\
    \ were more relevant than ALL of Con's previous round.\n\n***Power Over Nature***\n\
    \nI had pointed out a litany of examples where god has power over nature...here's\
    \ what Con said.\n\nCon concedes:\n\n> \"While it is true God has power over nature,\
    \ why is that?\"\n\nMy response:\\\nCon admits here that god has power over nature,\
    \ supporting heliolaters in their worshiping of god for god's power over nature.\n\
    \nTo answer the question, the reason why god has power over nature is that all\
    \ of the things we consider part of nature here on earth are controlled by the\
    \ power of god, I mean, without god, there is no nature on earth, so on the contingency\
    \ of earthly nature on god ALONE demonstrates god's power over nature.\\\nPlus\
    \ Con concedes god's power over nature.\n\nCon obliviously asks:\n\n> \"Did the\
    \ sun create nature?\"\n\nMy response:\\\nYes.\\\nI had sourced that the formation\
    \ of the earth was done by god mixing the right elements and coalescing the earth,\
    \ and I also sourced that these created-by-god elements were the ingredients for\
    \ the origin of life on earth, and these two components, earth with life, are\
    \ the literal creation of nature on earth.\\\nGod created the nature we experience\
    \ every day on earth.\n\n**Origin of life on earth**\n\nCon reckons:\n\n> \"Your\
    \ origin of life on Earth is flawed.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nIs it now?\\\nDo tell\
    \ why.\n\nCon shows ignorance:\n\n> \"The sun may have simply just provided the\
    \ right temperature/pressure for life to begin, that in no way can be translated\
    \ into 'The Sun created life'. \"\n\nMy response:\\\nI never said the sun, praise\
    \ be unto hydrogen, created life, check the debate, I said that god was central\
    \ to the origin of life on earth because of god's power over nature.\\\nAlso,\
    \ Con ignores that it wasn't just temperature/pressure from god that allowed organic\
    \ molecules and subsequent life forms to originate, because Con didn't bother\
    \ to read the source I had provided on the subject.\n\nMy source had indicated\
    \ god was \"used...for long-wave UV radiation to **generate** alanine, glycine,\
    \ serine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and cystine from a CH4, C2H6, NH3, and\
    \ H2S gas mixture,\" which were created by god when god formed the earth.\n\n\
    God was not only a catalyst for the origin of life.\\\nGod made the ingredients\
    \ photo-genetically, and then mixed in god's energy to originate organic compounds\
    \ and subsequent life forms.\n\nThe compounds were solar generated, Con.\\\nWhy\
    \ did you ignore that?\n\n**Formation of the Earth**\n\nCon admits:\n\n> \"Your\
    \ theory on the formation and structure of the Earth...might explain the earth\
    \ and it\u2019s formation...it fails to explain the formation of other physical\
    \ objects outside our solar system.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nNo one ever claimed that\
    \ god created objects outside of the system of god.\\\nWhat a preposterous thought.\\\
    \nNothing about god in this debate indicates that god must be responsible for\
    \ creating things outside of the system of god.\\\nNothing.\n\n**Our Days and\
    \ Nights on Earth**\n\nCon concedes:\n\n> \"we schedule our days/nights around\
    \ the rotation of the earth to the sun\"\n\nMy response:\\\nCon concedes to the\
    \ point that we organize our lives around god and that the value of a day-night\
    \ cycle is only possible with god.\n\nCon continues:\n\n> \"in fact, many activities\
    \ are independent of Night/Day (can I get three cheers for them finally installing\
    \ lights at Wrigley Field??).\"\n\nMy response:\\\nCon highlights why we typically\
    \ schedule baseball games during the day and, for that matter, most of our outdoor\
    \ activities, because we are utterly dependent on and we function concurrently\
    \ with god's appearance and lack thereof.\\\nGod provides us with guiding light\
    \ when we are active, and soft, quiet darkness when we're resting.\n\n***Creation\
    \ of the Sun, praise be unto hydrogen***\n\nThis bit from Con is another argument\
    \ in a series of irrelevant arguments.\n\nCon gets condescending:\n\n> \"Through\
    \ your power of reason and deduction, you should be able to deduce that something\
    \ had to have created the sun.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nYeah, it was a cloud of interstellar\
    \ dust that gravitationally collapsed into a hydrogen ball.\\\nThis doesn't change\
    \ the fact that we heliolaters worship god for god's power over nature and human\
    \ fortunes.\\\nThe event that created god does not negate god's existence, in\
    \ fact, that event validates god's existence.\n\n***Worshiping God***\n\nCon puffs\
    \ his chest:\n\n> \"While I could refute everything you write in defense of worshiping\
    \ the Sun...\"\n\nMy response:\\\nYou're not going to because the arguments are\
    \ insurmountable?\n\nCon continues:\n\n> \"...there's no need to.\"\n\nMy response:\\\
    \nSo instead of Con using his round to refute that god exists or that god is worshiped\
    \ or that humans depend on god to live, Con finds it sufficient to arbitrarily\
    \ talk about matter, a really dumb argument from Thomas Aquinas, the creation\
    \ of objects elsewhere in the universe, and then claim at the end of a completely\

  content: 'Not remotely relevant? The whole point is, if you can use logic and reasoning
    to show that some "thing" had to create the universe, the sun, etc, it stands
    to reason that worshiping the Sun is illogical when something much larger, much

    So if you make the claim that people are dependent on the sun, then I would argue
    "Yes, and because the sun is dependent on something else, this something else
    is also super human and should be worshiped as a God. "\

    Yep, and my response is, there something much greater than the sun-- superhuman
    too - more deserving of worship than the Sun. In fact, the sun depends on IT for
    it''s existence.


    Sorry, I did not concede that God is a physical entity. When did I concede that?
    Perhaps you have this debate confused with another one. lol. What I said is something
    immaterial (not of the material universe) had to create the universe (and thus
    the sun).


    Curious, why don''t you worship Earth? We are totally dependent on the earth,
    are we not? Without the earth, we wouldn''t survive. Earth''s gravity holds us
    to it-- without it we''d drive off into space. The earth provides the nutrients
    we need, the rain we need, etc.


    Having one or two super-human abilities does not a God make. Sorry. While the
    sun can melt an ice bridge extremely fast, that is not the only pre-requisite
    for being God. I can name a whole host of things that a human can do that a sun
    can''t do. One would expect a God to do everything a human can do, and more:


    1. Type a response on a debate blog

    2. Play Eddie Van Halen''s Eruption on guitar

    3. Make a margarita

    4. Think a thought

    5. Send a man to the moon.


    How many suns can do the above things?\

    So while the sun may have super-human abilities, humans have quite a bit of super-sun
    abilities--things the sun can''t do. If there are things we can do that the the
    supposed god can''t do, one should question why it should be worshiped as a God.


    Formation\

    Your argument claims that the Sun formed the Earth. Scientists disagree with you.


    Our Days and Nights - Again, my argument is simple:\

    We are not dependent on the sun any more providing guiding light. sorry.


    You did mention one key word in your defense of God-- you said "perfect" shape.


    Curious, how do you define "perfect"?

    Thanks for that Con.\

    All aboard!


    **Creating the Universe**


    I can''t for the life of me figure out why Con keeps talking about this; it has
    nothing to do with god.


    Con ignores the definitions again:


    > "The whole point is, if you can use logic and reasoning to show that some "thing"
    had to create the universe, the sun, etc, it stands to reason that worshiping
    the Sun is illogical when something much larger, much more powerful than the Sun
    is ''out there.''"


    My response:\

    That I worship the superhuman sun, praise be unto hydrogen, for having power over
    nature and human fortunes satisfies the definition of god, done.\

    More than that, god does not have to be the creator of the universe.\

    Where did you get that idea Con?Not from this debate.


    Also **the universe wasn''t created by god or otherwise**, therefore there was
    no creator of a universe that wasn''t created.\

    Creation is a temporal concept.\

    Spacetime originated at the universe''s origin.\

    A temporal process could not have occurred without time having originated.\

    No universe, no time, no temporal processes like creation.


    **creation** - the **process** of bringing something into existence.\

    [Oxford Dictionaries - creation](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/creation)


    **process** - a **series** of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a particular

    There is no creator of a universe that wasn''t created, so of course god didn''t

    ***Humans Depend on God to Live***


    Con concedes:


    > "If you make the claim that people are dependent on the sun, then I would argue
    yes..."


    My response:\

    This affirms my burden to show that humans depend on god to live...a nice concession
    from Con, thank you.


    Con continues:


    > "Yep, and my response is, there something much greater than the sun-- superhuman
    too."


    My response:\

    Ok, yeah, there''s lots of superhuman things, but to be clear, Con is agreeing
    that god is superhuman...so, who cares if other things are superhuman too?\

    Nothing in the definition of god says "must be the only superhuman thing."\

    That god is superhuman and Con concedes it is a major point.


    ***God Exists***


    Con becomes an amnesiac:


    > "Sorry, I did not concede that God is a physical entity. When did I concede
    that?"


    My response:\

    1st round.


    > "The sun is a physical entity in this universe. It is composed of matter."-Con


    Yes Con, since you''ve already agreed that I, like the Egyptians, worship the
    sun, praise be unto hydrogen, and you agree that this entity is physical, you''ve
    affirmed the resolution for me.\

    Thanks again Con.


    Con asks:


    > "Curious, why don''t you worship Earth?


    My response:\

    Sometimes I do...I''m sorry was this supposed to be a relevant point negating
    that my god is worshiped?\

    If so, it sucked.\

    So what if other things are worshiped for being superhuman?\

    Why does there have to be only one, again?


    Con gets ignorantly errant:


    > "Having one or two super-human abilities does not a God make. Sorry."


    My response:\

    Actually, by your own doing, that''s exactly what it makes...sorry.\

    You agreed to the definition of superhuman and god, Con.


    superhuman - having greater powers than humans have.\

    god - a superhuman existence


    I demonstrated countless examples of the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, having
    greater powers than humans have, and that exactly does a god make.\

    Thanks for playing.


    Con continues:


    > "I can name a whole host of things that a human can do that a sun can''t do."


    My response:\

    So?\

    This doesn''t make god any less superhuman, because all of those things that god
    can do that humans can''t.\

    Even if humans have supersolar powers, it wouldn''t negate that the sun, praise
    be unto hydrogen, has greater powers than humans rendering it superhuman.


    **Conclusion**


    God exists and humans depend on god to live, just ask Con.

    Thanks Con for that last...rant?...episode of whiny complaining?...mixing of off-topic
    nonsense?...display of childish assumptions and assertions?\

    Thanks for whatever that was Con.\

    While my favorite concessions to get are last round concessions, a 3rd round DIRECT
    concession from Con is pretty good.\

    Time to shine!


    ***God Exists and Humans Depend on God to Live***\*\*\*\*


    I, as Pro, had to prove that a superhuman being **worshiped** for its powers over
    nature and human fortunes exists and is something that humans depend on to live.\

    I had indicated that the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, is god to me and my fellow
    heliolaters, BECAUSE we **worship** it for all it does, and it''s obvious how
    humans are dependent on god.


    How does Con refute the resolution?\

    By exactly agreeing with it.


    Con **concedes DIRECTLY**:


    > "God exists and humans depend on god to live. That I believe."


    My response:\

    Since 1) Con agreed to the definition of god in this debate, 2) Con also agrees
    that we heliolaters worship the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, which makes it god
    per the agreed-to definitions, 3) and right here, Con **directly affirms the resolution**,
    this is a **major concession** from Con so voters must vote Pro.


    Con openly agrees with the resolution AND agreed to the definition of god.


    **Responding to Con''s Nonsense**


    Con stomps his feet:


    > "Sorry Magic Mike, you''ve done nothing to prove that the Sun is a God."


    My response:\

    Sorry inferior debater, you''ve done nothing to negate that the sun, praise be
    unto hydrogen, is **worshiped** for having powers over nature and human fortunes,
    in fact you obliviously concede it over and over again by talking about how silly
    it is that I worship it.\

    So oblivious this guy.


    Con whines:


    > "You fail to understand the basic definitions, like "contingent". You stretch
    it to mean what you want. Nice playin with ya."


    My response:\

    I mentioned the phrase "contingent on" twice in this debate.\

    **contingent on/upon** - occurring or existing only if (certain circumstances)
    are the case.[Oxford Dictionaries - contingent on](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/contingent)


    "Contingent on" also means "can exist only if" and I pointed out that the origin
    of life on earth was **contingent on** god and that humanity''s current existence
    is **contingent on** god.\

    Con thinks that contingent can **only** mean "dependent on" so he doesn''t understand
    what I''m saying about the origin of life happening ONLY IF the sun, praise be
    unto hydrogen, existed and provided the elements.


    Life and humans are both contingent on god, even if Con is unaware of what contingent
    means in a philosophical debate.


    Con goes off the rails:


    > "you think dreams/ideas/thoughts have a physical existence."


    My response:\

    Sorry readers, I have no idea what this has to do with this debate...we''re basically
    watching this debater unravel.\

    But while we''re here, things that are contingent on the physical are physical
    themselves though they are not made of matter; they are contingent on matter,
    so are therefore physical.


    Con continues:


    > "Likewise, you think the "God" simply means has some greater powers than a human"


    My response:\

    I think that god means EXACTLY what both debaters agreed to the meaning of god
    to be, "a superhuman existence worshiped for its powers over nature and human
    fortunes."So, with this in mind, yes, god, to be superhuman, would need some powers
    greater than a human.\

    Oblivious.


    Con gets worse:


    > "But i stand by my statement, having a few powers greater than a human does
    not a God make. Sorry. It doesn''t work like that."


    My response:\

    The definition of superhuman that Con agreed to by accepting the debate is


    superhuman - having **greater powers** than humans have,


    The definition of god that Con agreed to by accepting the debate is


    god - a **superhuman** existence.


    Having any greater powers than a human EXACTLY does a god make and Con, by accepting
    this debate, agrees with that even if he doesn''t understand how to debate properly.


    Sorry, that''s exactly how it works.


    Con desperately tries:


    > "What you haven''t proven is this: the sun is a God. The sun is a god in your
    mind. I get that. "


    My response:\

    Not only have I proven that the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, is worshiped, Con
    has proven it over an over again too.\

    Con''s called me out for worshiping the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, as god,
    Con referenced the Egyptians who worshiped god, and Con keeps repeating the error
    every round, right here as well, solidifying that my god is worshiped.


    The mere fact that I''ve repeated the damn phrase about hydrogen so many times
    proves that I praise and worship the great hydrogen ball, and this satisfies the
    resolution.


    Con mentions truth:


    > "Of course, as an atheist, I''m sure you believe Truth is subjective."


    My response:\

    a) I''m not an atheist, I''m a heliolater.\

    b) Even if I reject the god claim made by countless religions, I still believe
    there are objective truths.


    Con speaks foolishly:


    > "In case your curious, I''ve already won the debate."


    My response:\

    Here''s one last thing I''ve learned from debate.\

    The person who claims "I''ve already won," is always insecure, uncertain, cowardly,
    inferior at debating, and the actual loser.


    When children know they''re losing, they stomp their feet and say that they''re
    winning.\

    Thanks for the concession Con.\

    Maybe I''ll prove that **your** god isn''t real in a different debate...it''ll
    be fun to watch you squirm to try to demonstrate such a ridiculous god.\

    Hahahaha, Con looks funny when he squirms.


    **Conclusion**


    Thanks everyone, vote Pro.

    FACT #1 - Non-physical, non-material things exist. Some examples of these non-physical,
    non-material things are ideas, thoughts, dreams, concepts, etc. We know these
    are non-physical, non-material because


    a) One can not describe in physical terms the thing (idea, thought, dream etc)
    itself. Science can not measure these thigns (ideas, thoughts, dreams) because
    they do not have any physical components


    1. As a result, one has to resort to describing or observing the "effects'' or
    by-product, so to speak


    If you believe this is false, it should be easy to point to scientists etc that
    have proven that ideas, concepts or dreams have a physical component to them.
    I''m waiting.\

    FACT #2 - matter had ot have been created by something that is non-matter (im-material).
    See other arguments.


    If you believe this is false, then you are basically going against logic, since
    logic tells us that everything we observe could not create itself-- it needed
    something else to create it. It is dependent, dare I say "contingent" (LOL) upon
    something else.


    It follows that something non-physical, non-material (which we know non-material
    things exists) had to have created the universe and it''s Sun.


    Thus, this something else is worthy of worship than the Sun.

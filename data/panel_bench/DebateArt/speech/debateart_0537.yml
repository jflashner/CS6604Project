    \nThe models make brutal estimates and many assumptions (guesses). \u201CLab-warming\u201D\
    \ doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to \u201Cplanet-warming\u201D: Test tubes\
    \ don\u2019t have ocean currents, clouds, or rain. The \u201Cclouds and humidity\u201D\
    \ factor is mind bogglingly complex. For example, high clouds tend to warm the\
    \ planet, but low clouds tend to cool it. So which effect rules? Models don\u2019\
    t know, but they assume clouds are net-warming. This is not a minor point: The\
    \ feedback from clouds and humidity accounts for more than half of carbon\u2019\
    s alleged effect. E\u2019Gad.\n\nThus, the above data shows that CO2 has zero\
    \ effect on the climate and that if there was any change, then cloud cover would\
    \ compensate for this change and reduce temperatures back to normal. This is because\
    \ the Earth is a thermostat and can regulate its own temperature using cloud cover.\
    \ Thus, if my opponent insists that CO2 is adding 0.0000000001 degrees Celsius\
    \ warming, then this would be countered by cloud cover which would effectively\
    \ cancel out this extra warming.\n"

  content: "CO2 is a gas that is present in the atmosphere, that indeed does cause\
    \ climate change.\n\n**Greenhouse effect principle.**\n\nMost energy gets to the\
    \ earth from the sun in the form of UV and visible light radiation. It is absorbed\
    \ and reflected back by the earth in the form of infra red radiation.\n\nGases\
    \ in the atmosphere that are transparent to UV, but absorb infrared allows the\
    \ energy from the sun to hit the ground, but absorbs more of the heat coming from\
    \ the earth. This is referred to as \u201Cthe greenhouse effect\u201D\\[1\\]\n\
    \n**Properties of Carbon Dioxide**\n\nThe observable properties of CO2 are such\
    \ that it also acts a greenhouse gas\\[2\\]\n\nSatellite observations show that\
    \ the amount of radiated heat is going down as temperatures increase \\[3\\] with\
    \ a spectrum that correlated to more heat being absorbed by carbon dioxide.\n\n\
    **Effect of heat on the climate**\n\nClimate itself can be affected and modified\
    \ caused by the heat in the atmosphere, with increased heat driving more changes\
    \ in climate, including more severe weather. \\[4\\]\n\nThe current rise in temperature\
    \ of the earth, and the climate that is observably changing coincidence with an\
    \ increase in co2\\[5\\] because of the above there can be expected to be a causal\
    \ relationship: co2 traps heat, more co2, more heat.\\[6\\]\n\n**Contribution\
    \ of heat from Carbon Dioxide**\n\nThis increase of temperature from co2 increase\
    \ is logarithmic, meaning that each time the co2 in the atmosphere is doubled,\
    \ the amount of radiation reflected downwards increases by a linear amount 3.7W/m2,\
    \ this works out to be approximately 1 degree per doubling without factoring any\
    \ other process.\\[7\\] this indisputably shows that carbon dioxide is able to\
    \ change the climate.\n\nWhen considering feedback mechanisms - such as changes\
    \ to the earth\u2019s albedo due to heat, the cumulative effect of carbon dioxide\
    \ in the atmosphere, and other related effects, the effect of the increase in\
    \ thermal energy is actually more significant, or about 3 degrees for each doubling\
    \ \\[8\\]. This rate is consistent with temperatures in different geological time\
    \ and the carbon concentrations during this periods, including during recent ice\
    \ ages and past geological periods where the earth was much warmer. \\[9\\]\n\n\
    **Source of carbon dioxide.**\n\nFinally, it\u2019s clear that humans have been\
    \ responsible for the current elevated emissions. A primary way we can tell this\
    \ is that by measuring the isotopic breakdown of the carbon in the atmosphere\
    \ - this content has increased in line with the isotopic content of fossil fuels\
    \ rather than other sources: meaning that much of the addition carbon concentration\
    \ is being generated by humanity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nHuman co2 emissions have\
    \ increased the co2 content in the atmosphere, which due to its chemical properties\
    \ is affecting the climate.\n\n\\[1\\] <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect>\\\

    \ has, instead, decided to give a lecture on the establishment or IPCC version\
    \ of climate change.\\\nNote - That the IPCC ignores data that they don't like\
    \ or disagrees with the global warming preconceived assumptions.\n\nLets go back\
    \ in time to find the beginnings of climate change thinking.\n\nIt all started\
    \ with John Ruskin's \"plague wind\"\n\n.<https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/ruskin-paris-climate-change/420453/>\n\
    \nCommunists like Karl Marx were influenced by Ruskin, Carlyle and Disraeli.\n\
    \nThus, the concept that the industrial age was a threat to the environment was\
    \ born. Thus, climate change is essentially a communist system idea and a way\
    \ of introducing communists ideas through the use of climate change as a clever\
    \ disguise.\n\nThat leads us to Maurice Strong the person most responsible for\
    \ the forming of the IPCC.\n\n<https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/paris-climate-change-conference/12035401/Farewell-to-the-man-who-invented-climate-change.html>\n\
    \nExtract -\\\nIn 2005, Strong was caught having been illicitly paid $1 million\
    \ from the UN\u2019s Oil for Food programme, supposedly set up to allow Saddam\
    \ Hussein to pay in oil to feed starving Iraqis. He retired to a flat in Beijing,\
    \ where he had been close to China\u2019s Communist leaders back to Mao. It was\
    \ from there that he returned home to Canada to die,on November 27.\n\nThus, Maurice\
    \ Strong was clearly acting for the communists and their ideals.\n\nThe graph\
    \ below shows that the suns energy varies in 11 year cycles which relates to aether\
    \ flow blockage from large planets like Saturn and Jupiter.\n\n<http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/files/2011/09/TIM_TSI_Reconstruction-1.png>\n\
    \nThis can cause an average temperature change of 0.2 degrees over a ten year\
    \ period. Note - Some periods are stronger than others depending on the planets\
    \ relative positions to one another in relation to the Earth. Note - More light\
    \ equals more heat.\n"

    \ argument, I provided evidence that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming,\
    \ and quantified that contribution under \u201C_Contribution of heat from Carbon\
    \ Dioxide\u201D._\n\nPro **drops** this point.\n\nUnder my round 1 argument, I\
    \ provided evidence that co2 in the atmosphere is decreasing the heat sent to\
    \ space as measured by satellites as part of my \u201C_properties of carbon dioxide_\u201D\
    \ section.\n\nPro **drops** this point also.\n\nThese two parts together refute\
    \ the notion that co2 doesn\u2019t contribute to climate change, as they quantify\
    \ that it does indeed contribute, it specifies how much it contributes, and there\
    \ are measurements showing the way it contributes (through reflectivity) is occurring\
    \ in the atmosphere.\n\nThese all provide direct measurable evidence directly\
    \ refute pros claims:\n\n_\u201CLab-warming\u201D doesn\u2019t necessarily translate\
    \ to \u201Cplanet-warming\u201D_\n\n_\u201CThus, the above data shows that CO2\
    \ has zero effect on the climate\u201D_\n\n**Earth can regulate its temperature\
    \ with cloud cover.**\n\nPro asserts that cloud cover allows earth to regulate\
    \ its temperature, and asserts that cloud cover has an unknown effect on the warming\
    \ or cooling of the earth on models.\n\nFirstly, as I pointed out in the first\
    \ part of this round, we know for a fact that measurable reflected radiation has\
    \ decreased due to carbon dioxide. As a result, it is an indisputable fact that\
    \ carbon dioxide is increasing the temperature of the planet.\\[1\\]\n\nSecondly,\
    \ pro omits a key fact: The earth is heating up, and the climate is currently\
    \ changing as a result. \\[2\\]\n\nThe idea that changes in cloud cover as a means\
    \ to stabilize the temperature of the earth is clearly refuted by the fact that\
    \ the temperature of the earth isn\u2019t currently being stabilized by clouds.\n\
    \nWhile It is true that we do not know exactly the overall effect of clouds on\
    \ his much the world will heat up, the argument that it will not heat up is clearly\
    \ refuted by the fact that the world is currently heating up.\\[3\\]\n\n**Climate\
    \ change is communism / The IPCC leader was a communist**\n\nNothing pro said\
    \ here offers any argument against the scientific data I provided in the first\
    \ round.\n\nThe majority of pros point is speculation and insinuation that do\
    \ not appear to be warranted by the data and sources he provided.\n\nIf pro is\
    \ to show conspiracy, he must show evidence and argument that the current IPCC,\
    \ all climate data and science and related studies are all more likely to be fraudulent\
    \ than not, and give reasons why this is the case.\n\nMerely throwing two tangentially\
    \ related peices of information, and then asserting that it proves the last 40\
    \ years of climate science, and all related data is all a hoax is absurd and should\
    \ be rejected by voters.\n\nMoreover, this is also a genetic fallacy. Even were\
    \ it true that the idea that humans are harming the environment, came from communism\
    \ - doesn\u2019t render anything that has been said wrong.\\[4\\]\n\n**Sun cycles.**\n\
    \nFirstly, the sun varies in cycles of 11 years as pro suggests. However the heating\
    \ of the earth as measured over the last 100 years, and specifically the continued\
    \ and rapid heat rise since 1980 clearly shows the heating does not correlate\
    \ with an eleven year cycle, but has continued to rise consistently.\\[5\\]\n\n\
    Secondly, if the suns contribution is 0.2 degrees, then there is 3 times as much\
    \ warming still to be accounted for. 0.6 degrees of warming that cannot be accounted\
    \ for in terms of solar output.\n\nFinally Pro refutes himself here again: after\
    \ having said that clouds mitigate temperature rises, he now claims that temperature\
    \ rises are caused by the sun and are not mitigated. How can pro say cloud cover\
    \ mitigates warming but also doesn\u2019t motivate warming? This is obviously\
    \ an example of kettle logic.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nPro has answered none of\
    \ the points raised in my opening round, and has dropped all my arguments. I extend\
    \ all of these to the next round.\n\nPros arguments fall afoul of basic logic,\
    \ relying on assertions that are trivially refuted above.\n\nThe resolution is\

    \ a warming earth. Glaciers are retreating around the globe\\[4\\], the extent\
    \ of North Pole ice decreasing\\[5\\], and sea levels are rising\\[6\\]\n\nWhile\
    \ a graph can be faked, it\u2019s hard to melt glaciers, or raise the sea levels\

    \ for clouds to prevent warming of the planet, the the planet would not currently\
    \ be warming - which it demonstrably is.\n\nEven pro himself admits the sun contributes\
    \ 0.2 degrees of warming variation. **_Pro can\u2019t assert the earth isn\u2019\
    t warming for one argument, then assert that it is for another_**\n\nSecondly,\
    \ as I also pointed, we can tell co2 is decreasing the heat reflected into space,\
    \ which means we can demonstrably tell the earth must be retaining more heat,\
    \ and due to the spectrum we know it\u2019s due to co2. (See round 1). This point\
    \ was **dropped** by pro.\n\nBoth these facts refute pros claim that clouds prevent\
    \ warming. As pros argument is refuted, haggling over whether high clouds, or\
    \ low clouds have the most impact is largely irrelevant - as we know that whatever\
    \ impact they have, is not enough to prevent warming.\n\nThis debate is whether\
    \ co2 is driving global climate change, not to defend one particular climate model\
    \ or another, or to defend warming estimates from one source or another. As a\
    \ result, pros demands for me to justify relative warming of cloud cover are a\
    \ red herring.\n\n**Climategate proves a conspiracy.**\n\nFirstly, this wasn\u2019\
    t the IPCC, this was a different organization, the CRU.\n\nSecondly, it was talking\
    \ about tree ring data, not global temperatures.\n\n\u201CMikes trick\u201D, was\

    \ nonsensical.\n\nThese hacked emails reflected private correspondence between\
    \ colleagues, with the worst sounding examples being cherry picked.\n\nConsidering\
    \ that hackers had thousands of emails and documents, that an easily explainable\
    \ email is the best evidence - rather than original datasets, emails outlining\
    \ actual conspiracy such as explicitly stating they were going to make up data,\
    \ or referencing that conspiracy - clearly indicates pros point is wishful thinking.\\\
    [8\\]\n\nIf this were not enough, an independent investigation found that the\

    \ not offer any real support for this claim for me to refute. Thus it should be\
    \ rejected.\n\n**Solar cycles.**\n\nPro says the sub accounts for 0.2 degrees\
    \ of warming. The earth has warmed by 0.8 degrees (see sources above), meaning\
    \ 3 times the suns contribution to warming (0.2 x 3 = 0.6) remains to be accounted\
    \ for.\n\n**The sun is on a 200 year cycle.**\n\nPro blamed the warming that he\
    \ claimed doesn\u2019t exist on an 11 year solar cycle. When this was refuted\
    \ he now blames the warming he claims doesn\u2019t exist on a 200 year cycle he\
    \ provides no evidence for.\n\nPro needs to make up his mind whether the warming\
    \ patterns exist or not, he can\u2019t argue both sides.\n\nThere is no evidence\
    \ of a 200 year cycle in sunspots since the dalton minimum, even if there were,\
    \ as the dalton minimum was a low temperature period, a 200 year cycle means we\

    \ down to the sun. This is clearly incoherent.\n\nPro **drops** **the majority\
    \ of the scientific basis presented from round 1**, including evidence to support\

    \ my refutation of logarithmic carbon heating.\n\nPro **drops** my refutation\
    \ of clouds mitigating climate change\n\nIn fact, pro seems to simply be throwing\

  content: "**Clouds don\u2019t prevent warming - as the earth is warming**\n\nData:\
    \ Pros assertions that the IPCC were making up data was refuted by the fact that\
    \ the IPCC takes its data from 3 independent sources. This was **dropped** by\
    \ pro.\n\nGlaciers: Glaciers retreat because of warming. Pro states that they\
    \ have been retreating since the last ice age. Yes - this is because the earth\
    \ has been warming since the last ice age, with most of the warming occurring\
    \ in the last 30-40 years. Ironically pro let\u2019s slip here that was a last\
    \ ice age: **_How come the earth has warmed from an ice age if clouds prevent\
    \ warming from occurring?_**\n\nSea level: Japan\u2019s sea level has been rising\
    \ since the 1980s\\[1\\], it\u2019s primarily just the long term trend of sea\
    \ level for japan is unknown. This data has been discussed by the IPCC, which\
    \ raises the question: if the IPCC suppress and invents data: **why did they not\
    \ suppress this?**\n\nNow, while Japan\u2019s past tides have been higher, this\
    \ is not true of the UK\\[2\\], the US and canada\\[3\\], australia\\[4\\] and\
    \ South Africa\\[5\\]. What pro is doing here is called **cherry picking**, where\
    \ he picks tide data that supports his position, and ignores the ones that don\u2019\
    t.\n\nArctic retreat. Some ice melt can be attributed to soot in the atmosphere,\
    \ but not all. Pro should provide evidence that all ice melt is being caused by\
    \ soot, otherwise this should be rejected as an assertion.\\[6\\]\n\nAntarctic\
    \ retreat: Pro again conveniently cherry picks one study that analyzed data up\
    \ to 2008. Other studies that don\u2019t adjust for the height of the land in\
    \ the same way don\u2019t give the same answers: meaning that we\u2019re not even\
    \ certain what the study said is even true.\\[7\\], even so: it seems that even\
    \ that is not true any more, as the current massive ice melt that is occurring\
    \ is exceeding the additional snow fall produced by the warmer weather.\\[8\\\
    ]\n\nMore importantly, as before: if all the real data is being suppressed, and\
    \ only fake data is being reported: why did NASA allow this data to be released?\
    \ This, together with all pros other data completely refute pros narrative that\
    \ there is a conspiracy.\n\n**UN got estimates of climate refugees wrong.**\n\n\
    The estimates of people displaced by climate and weather related events were \u201C\
    up to 50m\u201D by 2010. The real number was approximately 22.5m as of 2015, with\
    \ millions more internally displaced, or temporarily displaced by flooding and\
    \ natural weather disasters.\\[9\\]\n\nNot a single person will disagree that\
    \ forecasting and prediction are not 100% accurate, and pro produces no argument\
    \ or justification as to why he feels that the UN not accurately predicting refugee\
    \ numbers demonstrates that co2 doesn\u2019t cause climate change.\n\nThis point\
    \ should be ignored as irrelevant.\n\n**Conspiracy theories**\n\nPro **Drops**\
    \ his argument and my rebuttal concerning the climategate emails. He drops his\
    \ argument regarding a communist conspiracy, and neglects to continue to provide\
    \ any information or evidence.\n\n**Cloud cover.**\n\nAgain - pro switches from\
    \ arguing that the earth is warming, to claiming it cant warm due to clouds. Which\
    \ is it?\n\nAs pro himself agrees that the earth is warming in his previous rounds,\
    \ and this one where he admits glaciers are retreating since the ice age, and\
    \ where he blames warming on solar cycles - pro himself refutes the argument that\
    \ clouds prevent the earth from warming.\n\nAs such, even if it is unknown the\
    \ specific and exact contribution clouds make, by virtue of the fact that the\
    \ earth has definitively been warming - that even pro agrees with when it suits\
    \ him - it demonstrates that clouds can not prevent warming.\n\nPro simply demands\
    \ I answer a question that is irrelevant, and **drops** my argument for why it\
    \ is irrelevant.\n\n**Dalton minimum.**\n\nAgain, pro now goes from asserting\
    \ there is no warming at all, to now arguing that the warming that doesn\u2019\
    t exist is caused by solar activity.\n\nPro argues there is a 200 year cycle of\
    \ solar activity. Pro has no evidence that such a cycle exists. The image provided\
    \ in the last round, and by pro this round shows a total of 400 years of solar\
    \ activity. There is obviously no discernible cycle in the 200 years before the\
    \ dalton minimum, and yet pro asserts a repeating pattern.\n\nIt is illogical\
    \ for pro to assert there\u2019s a 200 year cycle when there\u2019s is not even\
    \ a full completed cycle evidenced in the data.\n\nEven so, what pro completely\
    \ ignores is that while he is fixating on number of sun spots, he\u2019s ignoring\
    \ that we can measure fairly exactly the amount of heat that is received from\
    \ solar activity, and we can use that to determine how much heating that would\
    \ produce.\n\nIt accounts for - at best 0.1-0.2 degrees of the observed warming\
    \ since 1970, leaving 0.7 degrees unaccounted for. Pro dropped this when it was\
    \ raised before.\\[10\\]\n\n**Bad links.**\n\nPro claims the links I provided\
    \ didn\u2019t work, i invite voters to simply click on the link below:\n\n<https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ar4-wg1-chapter1.pdf>\n\
    \nPro clearly didn\u2019t bother to even open the link before trying to argue\
    \ that the link didn\u2019t exist. This means pro simply ignores the whole argument.\
    \ I extend.\n\n**The IPCC is a scam to make huge profits.**\n\nThe IPCC, the met\
    \ office, NASA, and most climate research are government or non-profit organizations.\
    \ There\u2019s no goods or services sold, and no shareholders to generate profits\
    \ for - so that the idea that these groups are attempting to take in \u201Chuge\
    \ profits\u201D is largely nonsensical.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nPros has dropped\
    \ multiple points in the last four rounds, and continues to do so; including the\
    \ entirety of my first round where I provided evidence that clearly shows the\
    \ impact of co2 on climate, and **I extend all these arguments for a third time**.\n\
    \nPro continues to change his story, drop his previous claims, and is simply throwing\
    \ things at the wall to see what sticks.\n\nPro has confused the IPCC with other\
    \ organizations, claimed the IPCC fakes its data when it agrees with me, yet the\
    \ data is acceptable and valid when he feels it suits him.\n\nPro has also repeatedly\
    \ switched between arguing the earth is warming and that it isn\u2019t.\n\nAs\
    \ a result, the science, evidence and logic clearly refute his position, and you\
    \ must vote for con.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\\[[1](https://www.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/kaiyou/english/sl_trend/sea_level_around_japan.html)\\\

    \ on Sea Level Change. And the uncompromising verdict of Dr M\xF6rner, who for\
    \ 35 years has been using every known scientific method to study sea levels all\
    \ over the globe, is that all this talk about the sea rising is nothing but a\
    \ colossal scare story.\\\nDespite fluctuations down as well as up, \"the sea\
    \ is not rising,\" he says. \"It hasn't risen in 50 years.\" If there is any rise\

    \ sea levels rising by 2.3mm a year. Until 2003, even its own satellite-based\

    \ past.\n\nThis is completely consistent with the idea that co2 produces a warming\
    \ effect.\\[5\\] In this case that co2 in the past had a more significant warming\
    \ effect which kept temperatures higher, even when considering a lower solar output.\n\
    \nPro then asserts that carbon dioxide has a negligible effect on climate. Pro\
    \ cannot simply assert this without evidence - as the only two arguments he\u2019\
    s provided to support this claim have been roundly refuted.\n\n**Summary.**\n\n\
    In the opening round, detailed analysis and evidence was provided about the physical\
    \ properties of carbon dioxide, and the measurable impact it has on the climate.\n\
    \nThis involved providing evidence from multiple sources.\n\nPro has not challenged\
    \ the science here, other than the single false assertion that carbon dioxide\
    \ cannot impact heating which had already been fully refuted in the opening round.\n\
    \nPro made a never-ending series of claims in this debate which he either dropped\
    \ or didn\u2019t bother to defend.\n\nHe claimed the suns 11 year cycle was responsible\
    \ for warming, then that there was no warming, and the that it was actually a\
    \ 200 year sun cycle that produced the warming he claimed didn\u2019t exist.\n\
    \nEach one of these issues he\u2019s raised has been systematically dismantled\
    \ in the rounds above, only to have been dropped and ignored.\n\nPro makes claims\
    \ of conspiracy. He confuses NASA with the IPCC and the met office, and the NOAA,\
    \ asserts that it\u2019s a communist plot without any rationale or evidence, he\u2019\
    s cited climategate, a completely different organization that isn\u2019t the IPCC\
    \ who\u2019s research has been broadly vindicated by investigations. He\u2019\
    s cited two highly dubious individuals when trying to support his conspiracy.\n\
    \nPro cherry picks data that he feels agrees with him, then claims the research\
    \ is suppressed, and conflicting data is ignored - repeatedly cites studies, and\
    \ data sets such as the climategate tree rings, Greenland ice sheet data, an Antarctica\
    \ study, sun spot data, data on the effect of cloud cover, sea levels of Japan\
    \ that I showed were either outlined and discussed at length by both IPCC or generated\
    \ by the very organizations pro claims is inventing data and suppressing inconvenient\
    \ data.\n\nThis is clearly absurd, and fundamentally undermines pros claims of\
    \ conspiracy.\n\nIf that were not bad enough, pro intersperses his claims that\
    \ the earth is warming for different reasons with his claims that the earth is\
    \ not warming.\n\nHe blames the sun and a recovery from the last ice age as reasons\
    \ for warming - then asserts that clouds prevent any warming from occurring.\n\
    \nThis is again, patently absurd.\n\nThe remainder of this debate has consisted\
    \ with pro dismissing data he doesn\u2019t like as faked, cherry picking data\
    \ and studies that agree with him and systematically ignoring the majority of\
    \ points that have been raised.\n\nThere is no other rational position than a\
    \ vote for con in this debate.\n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\]<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850>\n\

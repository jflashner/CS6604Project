    Salazar Slytherin \[4\]


    So, to summarize, (and if you''ve got a problem with my summary you can put your
    own terms on, and we''ll work something out) Slytherins are "ambitious" \[1, 4\],
    cunning \[3\], and put themselves first, \[2\].


    Now let''s review the behavior of Slytherins in the book.


    **Draco Malfoy**


    The first day of school, he tries to make friends with the popular boy, Harry
    Potter. This attempt fails when he estranges himself by insulting Ron Weasley.
    Now, a failed attempt does not constitute a failing as a Slytherin. But Draco
    makes no effort to endear himself and instead becomes bitter enemies with The
    Boy Who Lived.


    If you want to rise in power, it is best to have powerful friends. It is _very_
    important not to have powerful enemies. Draco has no regard for his future standings,
    despite the given "ambition" of Slytherins. Horace Slughorn at least got that
    principle with his "Slug Club."


    **Lucius Malfoy**


    Possibly the worst Slytherin ever, despite his wealth and connections.\

    In the second book, He decides to sneak one of Voldemort''s Horcruxes into the
    school for the purpose of re-opening the Chamber of Secrets, in order to further
    his pureblood elitism. All sounds perfect, **except he does it when HIS OWN SON
    IS ATTENDING HOGWARTS!** A cat, a ghost, and three students were petrified by
    this basilisk, which could easily have killed all but the ghost, and anyone, including
    Draco, could''ve stumbled across the serpent and died. Seriously, he''s had this
    for ten years between Voldy''s death and his own son attending Hogwarts, but he
    decides to use it now.\

    Later in the same book, he also tried to kill Harry Potter down the hall from
    Headmaster Dumbledore''s office, where Albus is.\

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3e1kdYjR8lg>\

    In the book, it doesn''t specify that he was going to kill him, but attacking
    a student is bad, especially when a suspect is currently wanted for opening the
    Chamber of Secrets.\

    **Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe**


    I am unaware of either of these people having any ambitions. Basically, they''re
    friends with Draco because their parents are all Death-Eaters.


    **Voldemort**


    Voldemort''s a pretty good Slytherin. First, he became the leader of powerful
    wizards and witches by creating a blood purist campaign, despite the fact that
    he''s a half-blood himself. Cunning? Check. Ambition? Check.\

    However, as we know that he is the Heir of Slytherin and opened the Chamber of
    Secrets while he was a student, why didn''t he just carry out the blood purists''
    plot then? There is no reason I can think of to wait.


    **So what?**


    Most of my examples also showed that person acting like a Slytherin, kinda dis-corroborating
    my claim. My point is that compared to the other houses, there are far too many
    exceptions.\

    Gryffindor has very few exceptions, mostly Peter Pettigrew and Neville Longbottom,
    though both have their moments of courage.\

    Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw aren''t as well documented, but there are no examples
    of either that act a way that directly contradicts their House.


    So J. K. Rowling has misrepresented Slytherin with these exceptions, and basically
    made them out to be the bad guys, possibly for the sole purpose of making Snape
    extraordinary in his sacrifices, etc. (The Snape contrast plot is entirely baseless,
    except by experience as a writer myself, and some gut feeling, but consider it
    if you will.)

  content: 'Grouping every possible personality into only 4 groups is no easy task,
    and as such it only stands to reason that some "rounding off" must be done. In
    fact, almost no one actually fits perfectly into their house, Hermione for example
    could be placed in either Gryffindor or Ravenclaw just as easily, and Harry Potter
    had to choose to be a Gryffindor to be recognised as one. Ron has elements of
    Slytherin, Hufflepuff and Gryffindor in his personality but lands in Gryffindor
    because he ultimately aligns with those traits most strongly.\

    There is no rule that says you have to perfectly match your house, almost every
    character has traits from other houses or lacks certain traits usually associated
    with their house. The fact that Crabbe and Goyle are bumbling idiots rather than
    cunning sociopaths does not change the fact that Slytherin fits them best, because
    while they are too stupid to have any real ambition or cunning they still have
    the underlying low IQ version of a Slytherin personality. They are conniving but
    not cunning, ruthless in their goals but too stupid to have any realistic or ambitious
    plans other than being powerful death eaters (which is presumably their respective
    goals).\

    As for Draco Malfoy, his actions do not contradict Slytherin in the slightest
    because while HP is a good connection to have he is the antithesis of what Slytherin
    represents and is the one who destroyed Voldemort whom the Malfoys are allied
    with.\

    Lucious Malfoy''s poor timing can mostly be attributed to being a plot device,
    and his attempted murder of HP can be attributed to a temporary lapse in self
    control induced by extreme anger. He is very much a Slytherin type person, but
    his cunning is undermined by psychopathic fits of rage and JK Rowling plot devices.


    In the end I think this debate comes down to whether you can contradict certain
    traits of the house but still fit into that house better than others, or if you
    have to strictly have the described traits of the house. I would argue that the
    answer is the former because practically everyone is an imperfect fit into their
    respective house.

    fit well in the other three houses, they go to Slytherin. But there should be
    a bunch of Hufflepuffs that aren''t ambitious, smart, or brave, without being
    hard-working or loyal.\

    Pettigrew isn''t smart, loyal or cunning, but seems to be mostly motivated by
    fear. He literally fits nowhere but gets put in Gryffindor, most probably just
    to have a friend that will betray the Potters.


    Imagine if Ravenclaw was like Slytherin House. There would be several people who
    aren''t smart. Let''s say that the four House values are rated as average, below
    average, and above average. There would, statistically, be people who go to Ravenclaw
    that have average intelligence and are below average everything else. But as far
    as the evidence shows, there are none.

    If that''s the case, you will have to find more examples, since the ones you already

    Granted, I can''t seem them in any of the other houses, but Rowling is still representing
    Slytherin badly. There should, by the math I showed earlier, be as many Ravenclaws
    of average intelligence as there are Slytherins of average cunning.

    That''s a matter of opinion. I don''t personally believe that your rebuttals in
    R1 actually negated my points. The voters may decide for themselves.

    Ravenclaw is defined entirely by being bright, witty etc. Whereas Slytherin is
    more subject to interpretation. IRL examples of Slytherin type people range from
    Hitler to Bill Gates. Both are cunning and ambitious but they are completely different,
    whereas almost every IRL Ravenclaw type is a scientist or artist.\

    In fact, now that I mention it, although Ravenclaw is more straightforward than
    Slytherin, it is still not entirely what you would expect. Take Luna Lovegood
    for example, she is a right-brained Ravenclaw (more of an artist than a scientist)
    but Ravenclaw by it''s description appears inherently left-brained in many ways.
    A Ravenclaw could theoretically be poor at academics and even appear dumb on the
    surface, but be a super-witty artistic genius who is only bright/witty when it
    comes to creativity. Perhaps this is similar to the case of Crabbe and Goyle,
    who appear to be borderline retarded but actually posses a form of low animal
    cunning under the right circumstances.


    > That''s a matter of opinion.


    Nothing is truly a matter of opinion.

    There is no basis for the assumption it would be an equal 1/4 split. Ravenclaws
    are actually the rarest type of person because most people are dumb.

    Not necessarily.

    **1. School**\

    **Merriam Webster defines school as:**\

    _"an organization that provides instruction: such as_\

    **_a_**\

    **_:_** _an institution for the teaching of children_\

    **_b_**\

    **_:_** [_COLLEGE_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/college)_,_ [_UNIVERSITY_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/university)\

    **_c_\*\*\*\*_(1)_**\

    **_:_** _a group of_ [_scholars_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scholars)
    _and teachers pursuing knowledge together that with similar groups constituted
    a medieval university_\

    **_(2)_**\

    **_:_** _one of the four faculties of a medieval university_\

    **_(3)_**\

    **_:_** _an institution for specialized higher education often associated with
    a university"_\

    **2. Mathematics**\

    **Merriam Webster defines mathematics as:**\

    _"the science of numbers and their operations (see_ [_OPERATION sense 5_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/operation)_),
    interrelations, combinations, generalizations, and abstractions and of space (see_

    > **1**. **school does not teach you about life and does not matter in the long
    term**.


    This is Pro''s first claim, therefore if I prove that school teaches any aspect
    of life or I prove that school helps people in the long term, then Pro''s first
    argument is False.


    > - A good head start for learning

    > - A great chance to develop social skills.

    > - Exposure to enhance communication skills.

    > - Putting students on a path of lifelong learning

    > **. School does not teach you have to be creative and use your mind but rather
    use memory. In a time where you need creativity and be innovative.**


    Again, if I prove school teaches you to be creative in any way, then Pros, argument
    is wrong.

    Creative.


    I have no more room for this argument. I will continue after Pro''s response.

  content: 'First of all, Pro I would like to point out, that my first argument would
    have been longer if not for the word limit on this debate, so maybe next time
    fix that.


    Pro has not provided much of a counter argument; they have only stated what has
    been said.


    > Most of the article''s points were about socializing when many of my points
    were about creativity and memory.


    Let''s define creativity and memory:\

    **Creativity**\

    **Merriam Webster defines creativity as:**\

    _"the ability to_ [_create_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/create)\

    _her artistic_ _creativity_\

    _2_\

    **_:_** _the quality of being_ [_creative_](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/creative)"


    **Memory**\

    **Merriam Webster defines memory as:**\

    **_"_** _the power or process of reproducing or recalling what has been learned
    and retained especially through associative mechanisms_\

    _began to lose his_ _memory_ _as he grew older_\

    **_b_**\

    **_:_** _the store of things learned and retained from an organism''s activity
    or experience as evidenced by modification of structure or behavior or by recall
    and recognition_\

    _has a good_ _memory_ _for faces"_


    My points:


    > - A good head start for learning

    > - A great chance to develop social skills.

    > - Exposure to enhance communication skills.

    > - Putting students on a path of lifelong learning


    Learning social skills, and communication skills, helps with creativity and memory.


    > I have said the education system is not necessarily school


    Same thing. The U.S. education system is school.\

    School is just another name for it.


    And look Pro, I would love to elaborate more, but I can''t because of your choice
    of settings for this debate. If you want to start a new debate, and make the settings
    more tolerable, then I would happily accept.


    I do have more arguments, but not enough space to write them in.


    Thank you.

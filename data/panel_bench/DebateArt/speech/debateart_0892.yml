  content: 'I think your fourth point ("Self-Image") is off the mark and is crafted
    in such way to support your argument. The conscience, moral compass so to speak,
    is what guides behavior. It''s not necessarily about a person''s "wants" or "needs"
    it''s about understanding the difference about what one should do, or what one
    shouldn''t do. People don''t necessarily follow their conscience (i.e. follow
    their morals) because they "want to feel better" about themselves. They do it
    because they understand the difference between "right" and "wrong". People demonstrate
    this every day.


    Guilt and joy, while they can be motivators, are purely symptoms of our brains
    reconciling what we know we should do vs what we did or didn''t do.


    1. The guy that steps in front of a bullet to save a young child, he''s not doing
    it because he wants to feel the "joy" of it-- he''s doing it because he knows
    it''s the right thing to do.

    2. The mom who works 2 jobs to support her growing family isn''t doing it because
    she "enjoys" the "joy" she feels, she''s doing it because of the good it brings
    to her family.


    You are making an assumption, that there is NOT a 5th element-- doing something
    simply because it benefits others. Rather, you imply as a truth that the reason
    folks do something "altruistic" is purely for selfish reasons, because they prefer
    the joy of knowing they did something good over the guilt of failing to act.


    Granted, when people do things that are altruistic they may often feel "joy" afterwards
    or during -- that is not to say though, and it would be wrong to say though, that
    that was the sole reason for them doing it.\

    Parents (good parents) practice this all the time.

    I''ve neglected instinct. Maternal instinct, for instance, calls for the protection
    of children. We see animals do this all the time in nature.\

    Maternal instinct is not exclusive to mothers, that''s merely a colloquialism.


    Humans, I believe, have a "pack instinct" to protect other people. This instinct
    isn''t set in who it covers. Some people will risk their lives for their pets.
    Nazi''s pack instinct didn''t cover Jews or homosexuals. French instinct didn''t
    always cover the English or Germans.


    People will subconsciously associate people as being in the same "pack" as them
    just by spending time with them, sometimes. This is somewhat correlated to Stockholm
    Syndrome. Sympathy is where you include people into your "pack" because you have
    shared characteristics. This is the principle behind Nationalism. Associating
    all your fellow countrymen as part of your pack jus because they are of the same
    nationality.


    Stepping in front of a bullet is generally not a conscious decision, but a split-second
    reaction. A result of instinct, to protect.


    > People don''t necessarily follow their conscience (i.e. follow their morals)
    because they "want to feel better" about themselves. They do it because they understand
    the difference between "right" and "wrong". People demonstrate this every day.


    Right and wrong are societal conceptions instilled into you as an infant, and
    aren''t easily changed. For instance, 200 years ago it was "right" for a slave
    to serve his master without pay. In 1945, Germany, it was "right" to kill Jews.
    People "knew" that these things were right. But now the boundary of "right and
    wrong" has shifted. The only constant is that people are motivated to follow their
    moral "knowledge."\

    People follow their moral beliefs because otherwise they, by way of dichotomy,
    abandon them. If they do not obey what their conception of morality dictates they
    do, then they admit that they are wrong. And humans do not like to admit that
    they are wrong, because the socially reprehensible slave owners and Nazis that
    we have risen above were wrong too.


    > You are making an assumption, that there is NOT a 5th element


    Yes, I am. And you are making an assumption that there is one.\

    My four points necessarily contradict each other sometimes. Prove that there is
    an action that contradicts all four, and you have proven a fifth element. Otherwise,
    I can relegate motivation for that action to one of my four points.

  content: 'I''ve given you the fifth element-- the fact that people do things all
    the time simply for the sake or benefit of someone else.


    You''ve listed 4 elements, but didn''t necessarily "prove" them-- they are just
    statements that can either be agreed to or disagreed with. You agree with them--
    they support your theory. I agree with them as well-- but I also add the 5th element
    and say those aren''t the only 4 motivators.


    I think you nailed it-- stepping in front of a bullet may in fact be instinct....but
    does that preclude it being a selfless act? I don''t think it does.


    The point of your initial argument is that we don''t do things (i.e. motivated)
    out of "selfless-ness" (benefiting the "other"), but rather out of "selfish-ness"
    (benefiting the self).


    The "stepping in front of a bullet" scenario may in fact be instinct, but I could
    argue it''s a "self-less" instinct as much as you could argue it''s "selfish"
    a one. And even if you were to say it benefits the pack, I would counter and say
    "Exactly! It benefits the group/pack as a whole, not necessarily the ''self'',
    therefore it''s not a selfish act. And if it''s not a selfish act, then that means
    it''s a self-less act".


    Thanks for your explanation of "right" and "wrong". However, it does not discount
    my argument that people do things out of what they perceive to be right / wrong,
    instead of how it benefits themself(selves), regardless of how "right/wrong" are
    determined. If you believe your explanation discredits my argument, I''d like
    you to show how.


    I believe the "stepping in front of a bullet" scenario contradicts your four points.
    As a recent example, let''s use the sad case of the Kendrick Castillo, the brave
    young man who tackled the assailant and helped stopped the Colorado shooting,
    but was killed in the process. This is all conjecture mind you, but logically,
    some of these motivators just don''t make sense in specific instances.


    - Carrot - eh....I''m willing to guess he wasn''t seeking pleasure when he tackled
    the guy

    - Stick - eh, i''m willing to guess he was doing it to avoid pain. Sure you can
    argue he did it so he would avoid the pain of him being shot, but I could counter
    with maybe he was actually doing it so that others would avoid the pain, not necessarily
    him?

    - Public Self-Image - again, conjecture, but I doubt he was thinking "Hmmm, I''m
    going tackle this guy and save people because I want to be perceived as a hero.".
    Sure, there are those who do it, but again, i would counter, there are those who
    do it and that thought doesn''t even cross their mind.

    - Self-image - this is probably your strongest motivator (not mine), but i would
    argue it may not necessarily be the motivator. Your argument is that people obey
    their morals because they want to feel good, not feel guilty. Again, I would argue--
    not necessarily so. People may do things simply because it''s the right thing
    to do-- not for the "joy" of feeling good about doing good. Again, I find it hard
    to believe that this guy would risk/give his life for others because he wanted
    to "not feel guilty" but rather "feel good". I believe he did simply because he
    knew it was wrong to kill others. And I''m having a hard time following your logic
    that when we do the "right" or avoid the "wrong" we do so for selfish reasons....

    See, you have only made statements as well. You don''t know what thoughts Kendrick
    Castillo was thinking when he tackled that man.\

    I would like to suggest that it may have been instinct. You have probably heard
    of the "Flight of Fight" response to threats. Most creatures will seek to get
    away from a threat or eliminate it. This fits his actions. Fight or Flight, by
    the way, is a self-preservation instinct.


    > stepping in front of a bullet may in fact be instinct....but does that preclude
    it being a selfless act?


    Instinct is an unconscious act. It has no conscious motivation behind it at all,
    which means that it is neither selfish or selfless. I would call it arbitrary,
    but that would be inaccurate. For now, I''m going with "impulse action."

    You are correct. For instance, I might fight someone to get a possession of mine
    back, especially if I had an emotional attachment. Fighting to protect people
    goes back to the pack instinct. self-preservation is not the only form of selfish
    action.


    > "instinct" does not automatically equate to "self-ish".


    As I already said,


    > Instinct is an unconscious act or urge. It has no conscious motivation behind
    it at all, which means that it is **neither selfish or selfless.**


    My claim is "Human motivations are never selfless," which doesn''t strictly mean
    all human motivations are selfish. That is a false dichotomy, also called the
    black and white fallacy


    > as I stated, "Fight or Flight" may not necessarily be a self-preservation tactic


    We''re back to the "you only claim this, you can''t prove it" portion.

    You say "instinct is an unconscious act or urge. It has no conscious motivation,
    which means that it is neither selfish or selfless"


    Perhaps it would be prudent now to insist on some definitions.

    How would you define "selfish"?

    in defense of others as far as I can tell. The Fight or Flight response is a "physiological
    reaction that occurs in response to a perceived harmful event, attack, or threat

    threat to his person, as I already stated.


    Here are my definitions.\

    Selfless: entirely concerned with things other than yourself and your own needs
    and wants.\

    Selfish: entirely concerned with your needs, wants, and self.


    > Regardless of being conscious or not, or an urge, an instinct is still a motivation,
    correct?


    Yes, they are. But as I already made clear, conscious thought is required to make
    a motivation selfless or selfish, which is why I said instinct is neither. My
    definitions (which I''ve had since before you accepted the debate, look in the
    description, so I didn''t change them to fit my argument) require a concern. Concern
    is conscious, not automatically felt like instincts are.


    > My four points necessarily contradict each other sometimes. Prove that there
    is an action that contradicts all four, and you have proven a fifth element. Otherwise,
    I can relegate motivation for that action to one of my four points.


    Add on unconscious instinct as a fifth motivator, and find me a single action
    that isn''t motivated by one of these five. If it doesn''t fit any of them, then
    it by definition has a selfless motivation.

  content: 'Sorry not buying it. I don''t think "conscious thought" is a requirement
    for determining whether an action is selfish or selfless. That may be YOUR definition,
    but again, i''m not buying it. You said you made it clear-- actually no, you didn''t.
    You simply stated conscious motivation is required to deem an act selfish or selfless,
    and assume I agree with this premise. I don''t agree with it -- and repeating
    it again won''t convince me either lol.


    Concern isn''t necessarily "conscious". Sure if you are using the word as somewhat
    synonymous with "aware" , then perhaps you can stretch it to that. But you didn''t
    say that in your initial description, only in your follow on argument(s). Whereas
    I can counter and say no no no.....concern means "related to", which has no implication
    of "consciousness".\

    Therefore, using my interpretation of "concern", If an action is related to the
    self, it is "selfish", whether or not the act-or is aware (conscious) of it or
    not. Likewise, an action related to someone else is self-less, whether nor not
    the person is conscious of it or not.


    With that being said, there is no ''middle ground"-- an action is either selfish
    or selfless.


    Therefore it follows that if an action is not related to the self, then it is
    not selfish, and by default must be selfless (there is no middle ground).


    Examples of such actions including the giving of one''s life for someone else.
    These can, and often are, selfless actions.


    Now, regarding Kendrick Castillo, perhaps you are right. Perhaps he did it to
    save his own life. But there are numerous instances of people risking/giving their
    lives for others every day (cops, fireman, etc). They do it not because their
    own life is in danger, but because others lives are in danger.

    \ history to live. His eccentricity and unconventional worldviews attracted the\
    \ attention of some of the most important men and rulers of the time. Plato himself\
    \ is described as referring to Diogenes as the version of Plato that went insane.\\\
    \n[1](https://iep.utm.edu/diogenes-of-sinope/#H2)\n\n**His Astonishing Perceptiveness**\n\
    \n- Diogenes\u2019s awareness of people and their mentalities demonstrates his\
    \ observation skills and makes him an excellent judge of character.\n- His understanding\
    \ of materialism and the wealthy, but having lived as a homeless man gives him\
    \ the perspective to see life from both points of view.\n- Knowledge of social\
    \ customs and etiquette was profound, but succeeded only by his rudeness and distaste\
    \ for meaningless rules.\n\nDiogenes knew what drove the rich and materialistic\
    \ class. He saw no need to live like them and having chosen to live as a homeless\
    \ man, he developed a level of self-sufficiency that is not otherwise known to\
    \ more privileged men who live a more civilized life.\n\n**Insight Into Human\
    \ Emotion**\n\n- Diogenes knew that possessiveness and obsession were the root\
    \ causes for human depression.\n- Materialistic objects held no objective value\
    \ in the eyes of Diogenes and it was pointless to assume they did.\n\nDiogenes\
    \ believed that personal fulfillment and satisfaction could only come through\
    \ leading a minimalist life where people did not form emotional attachments to\
    \ fancy-looking objects. This philosophy was based on the belief that, _\u201C\
    The things that you own end up owning you.\u201D_\n\n**Skepticism of Cultural\
    \ Values**\\\nDiogenes didn\u2019t reject social beliefs just for the sake of\
    \ being different. He didn\u2019t oppose them just because they were thoughts\
    \ held by the majority. Diogenes had his own set of values that he prioritized\
    \ and would naturally question social customs & etiquette that didn\u2019t make\
    \ sense to him.\n\nBy always assuming an attitude of questioning everything, he\
    \ demonstrated his independence. Whereas if he rejected these values because they\
    \ were held by the majority, he would be considered sheep for the other herd.\n\
    \n**Aversion to Authority**\\\nMany men in history have feared tyrants so much\
    \ that they assume appeasing them was the natural human instinct. Diogenes possessed\
    \ no such fear of authority, as he knew that their title was a social construct\
    \ and a fabrication of the imagination, not the result of any objective divination\
    \ or importance.\n\nSo his ability to stand up to powerful rulers like Alexander,\
    \ The Great is likewise a demonstration of an attitude beyond his time. People\
    \ could make the argument that this was foolish, but foolish implies he was unaware\

    \n**BoP framework**\n\nWisdom is defined, in the description as being linked to\
    \ experience, knowledge and good judgement. Diogenes ended up homeless and a loser.\
    \ This is not an insult to him, he literally wanted to be that and encouraged\
    \ others to join him being that. He didn't have much knowledge or good judgement,\
    \ 'experience' is a pretty irrelevant metric in this debate, surely the one who\
    \ lived longer isn't automatically wiser.\n\nDescartes had knowledge of science\
    \ and mathematics, both to professional levels. He had this knowledge on top of\
    \ his philosophical knowledge and boundary-pushing ideas. His life was a series\
    \ of good decision-making, he was basically the nerd by nature who ended up living\
    \ the life most people advise people to live.\n\nHe had good grades, good social\
    \ skills, not that bad looking at all (as in grooming not just natural looks)\
    \ based on paintings, had a child named Francine, not clear if he got married\
    \ but he certainly reproduced and was the known father (had a girlfriend, not\
    \ just a fling).\n\nHe was basically lacking in pretty much 0 department even\
    \ superficially. He _lived_ as an example to follow, not just some hobo pretending\
    \ to know how to live life.\n\nHis philosophy is so complex it's difficult to\
    \ even write out here as it requires a novel or more to really explore in full.\n\
    \nHis major four works were:\n\n- [_**The World**_ **and** _**Discourse**_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/#WorlDisc)\n\
    - [**The** _**Meditations**_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/#Medi)\n\
    - [**The** _**Principles**_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/#Prin)\n\
    - [**The** _**Passions**_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/#Pass)\n\
    \  The fact he had a child out of wedlock is even explored in the first part.\
    \ He didn't see the need for marriage, nor did his girlfriend but he understood\
    \ it was taboo and tried to 'hide' it. He explores this and many other things.\n\
    \nHe is the official founder of the solipsist axiom 'I think, therefore I am'.\n\
    \nIn fact I may as well just paste this:\n\n> 1. 1. **_Discourse on the Method\
    \ of Rightly Conducting One's Reason and of Seeking Truth in the Sciences_ (1637)**:\
    \ This 1637 text introduces Descartes' most famous quote, \"Je pense, donc je\
    \ suis\" (\"I think, therefore I am\"). It also provides a basis for methodological\
    \ skepticism, a technique Descartes would return to in later writings. He begins\
    \ with skeptical statements about various concepts that most consider to be dogmatic\
    \ truisms. He then uses logic and rational arguments to establish that, indeed,\
    \ these concepts and principles are true.\n> 2. 2. **_Meditationes de Prima Philosophia\
    \ (Meditations on First Philosophy)_ (1641)**: This relatively short publication\
    \ introduced the core of Descartes' philosophy and returns to Descartes' methodological\
    \ skepticism (sometimes called \u201CCartesian doubt\u201D). Using both ontological\
    \ arguments and trademark arguments, Descartes offers a series of [proofs](https://masterclass.com/articles/baking-101-what-is-proofing-learn-how-to-proof-breads-and-other-baked-goods)\
    \ to assert the existence of God, humanity, and the self. The text also endures\
    \ for its introduction of mind-body dualism, also called Cartesian dualism, and\
    \ what became known as the mind-body problem, which future philosophers such as\
    \ John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, and David Hume debated.\n> 3. 3. **_Principles of\
    \ Philosophy_ (1644)**: This text features the Latin quotation, \"Cogito ergo\
    \ sum,\" a translation of the French quote, \"Je pense, donc je suis,\" and the\
    \ English, \"I think therefore I am.\" It expands on the notions of epistemology\
    \ found in Descartes' _Meditations_, but its reputation was partially sullied\
    \ by a number of statements about physics that were later disproved.\n> 4. 4.\
    \ **_Les Passions de l'\xE2me (The Passions of the Soul)_ (1649)**: This work\
    \ marked Descartes' final philosophical treatise. The text explores the relationship\
    \ between science and moral philosophy. It also revisits the mind-body dualism\
    \ (Cartesian dualism) introduced in prior works and presents the concept of \"\
    animal spirits,\" which Descartes believed to control physiological behavior within\
    \ human beings. He declared that passions attack the soul and compel the body\
    \ to behave with impropriety. The text submits that understanding passions, and\
    \ controlling them, is integral to a moral life.\n\n[**https://www.masterclass.com/articles/rene-descartes-life-and-philosophy**](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/rene-descartes-life-and-philosophy)\n\
    \nHe is so fundamental to philosophy in modern times that not only is the phrase\
    \ Cartesinism given to a branch (with subbranches) that he founded but his name\
    \ Descartes led to an adjective Cartesian to refer to his brand of ideas such\
    \ as dualism and solipsism (and the Cartesian is usually the 'original' among\
    \ the theories, others being evolved from it).\n"

    \nDiogenes prioritized adaptability above anything else, making his mind truly\

    \ becoming a primitive survivalist, just that depending on less and living for\
    \ personal self-fulfillment is better than an ambition for power or a desire for\
    \ wealth.\\\nThere was a method to his madness. Diogenes was one of the early\
    \ pioneers of a practice called **Asceticism.**\n\n- _**\u201CAsceticism, (from\
    \ Greek aske\u014D: \u201Cto exercise,\u201D or \u201Cto train\u201D), the practice\

    \n- _**\u201CSuch auctions typically began by asking where the slave was from\

    \n**Relevance & Accomplishments**\n\nDescartes was born into wealth and raised\
    \ into a privileged life, having been groomed to be successful, but Diogenes lived\
    \ as a nobody and immortalized his beliefs & works with nothing to work with.\\\
    \nAlthough Descartes is academically inclined. He doesn\u2019t possess the spiritual\
    \ discipline and savviness of Diogenes and Descartes\u2019s accomplishments are\
    \ entirely superficial. The relevance of a certain philosopher is by their level\
    \ of fame and fanbase.\\\nMany scholars probably recognize Descartes by name,\
    \ but few know what his actual beliefs are or what he stood for. The hallmark\
    \ of wisdom is when the glory of an idea surpasses the obscure man\u2019s popularity.\n\

    Is this ''experience'' supposed to remotely suggest wisdom? Descartes experienced
    being a father, having sex, being an expert at many things and releasing books
    that even when challenged or proven wrong

    This is bullshit. Meeting many people isn''t even wisdom, ''experience'' doesn''t
    mean meeting many people, it means:

    There is nothing about just going to many places and being homeless that imply
    wisdom, like what is this about how is this a ''dropped argument''?


    > - He was also taught by Anisthenes, one of the great disciples of Socrates.


    So, he was a student, not a wise man or teacher. He perhaps learned from a wise
    person, is that your argument? What is your argument? Is your argument that he
    lived by what he was taught? There is nothing here to explain how this links to
    experience.


    > - **Knowledge-** Diogenes knows nearly almost all the languages in the world.


    He was around before some cultures and languages even existed.\

    You are pulling this out of nowhere, where did you get this idea? You are literally
    making it up and gaslighting me or the audience to think I dropped it. Why should
    I reply to an unproven lie?


    > - He is well-educated on cynicism and asceticism.


    Okay? Where is your evidence of this? Do we take your word on it? How did he display
    this knowledge?


    > - He understands people and humanity on a spiritual level, an understanding
    and knowledge not possessed by others.


    This has not been remotely proven in your entire case. Are you also claiming ''others''
    is everyone else? Noone else understands people and humanity on a spiritual level?
    Like what are you even saying? To me you are just writing nonsense and lies.


    > Diogenes is also well-versed in nearly all social customs and etiquette, having
    studied them all.


    He knew some Greek ones and decided to be a rebel hobo that stood against them
    instead, which you celebrated him for. Stop lying constantly, please.


    > **Judgment-** He is very street-savvy and knows how to obtain an adequate amount
    of food & water without money or shelter.


    Okay? Is this meant to be ''good judgement'' or coping with the consequences of
    terrible judgement? I don''t even know if they had money when this guy was around
    for him to lack it. You are just telling us this.


    > This demonstrates a level of self-sufficiency not accessible to people of his
    or Descartes time.


    You get people able to live on others'' wealth and cope all the time. You even
    criticised Descartes for being born into wealth and capable of thriving/surviving
    without needing to earn much himself, make your mind up. Is that wise or not?


    > Diogenes also understands people and humanity on a spiritual level,


    This is something you keep saying with absolutely zero proof or clarification
    what this ''level'' even is or means.


    > so he is a master of psychology and the key to happiness.


    He has 0 education in psychology and you have not proven he was happy or that
    being happy is the proof of good judgement or wisdom.


    > His level of persuasion also demonstrates peak judgment, since he is able to
    manipulate a situation where he is the victim to his favor. (Manipulating the
    pirates and commanding the respect of famous rulers like Alexander The Great.)


    What are you even talking about? Having some minimal social skills is not proof
    of being so high in good judgement or the wisest philosopher in history at all.
    It is you who has dropped my case by the way.

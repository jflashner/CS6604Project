  content: 'Mankind invented the existence of morality. Morality is an idea and a
    concept that differs from culture to culture and is relative to every individual.\

    Thereby making it a social construct. Animals are barbaric and too primitive by
    nature to comprehend something as complex as morality. Humans are the only intelligent
    and evolved enough species to attempt to traditionally define what constitutes
    an objective moral value.


    Since morality exists only in the minds of human beings, then by what foundation
    do we have for objective moral values?\

    **None.**


    If a supreme being exists, then he is the symbol for eternal goodness. And not
    just the symbol, but the ultimate model. Without a divine creator, we have no
    framework for which to judge moral values. But by having a supreme being as our
    model, he ultimately sets the standard for what morals are and can serve as the
    basis for defining what actions are good and what actions are evil.


    Without a divine being, no such values exist and become a completely subjective
    thing. But with a supreme being, objective morality can exist independently of
    human belief.

  content: "First, I would like to thank Pro for suggesting and instigating this debate.\
    \ This debate began because I questioned the proposition that Pro had stated in\
    \ the forums. No answer was provided there, but hopefully we can hash it out here\
    \ and determine exactly what is meant and if it has any merit. Before we continue,\
    \ I just want mention I have not pre-read Pro\u2019s first round and intend to\
    \ address his arguments in the next round.\n\nPro hopes to convince us that objective\
    \ morality can only exist with authority a divine being lends it. If I am going\
    \ to steel man my opponent\u2019s argument, I\u2019d say he believes a divine\
    \ being provides the standard by which we measure right or wrong actions and may\
    \ act as some type of enforcer. Now, full disclosure, I\u2019m an atheist, so\
    \ I don\u2019t think this is the case, but I acknowledge this is an accepted theory\
    \ of objective morality.\n\nThe real question in this debate though is not whether\
    \ morality requires Pro\u2019s preferred deity, but whether a higher power is\
    \ required for objectivity. The short answer is easily: gods are not required\
    \ for something to be objective.\n\nThe rules of chess exist independent of individual\
    \ human opinion and they are objective. Would Pro have us believe there is a god\
    \ of chess to somehow make the rules objective? Science provides an objective\
    \ means to understand our shared reality and it operates on methodological naturalism\
    \ (sans gods). Mathematics came from human minds, works without the need for gods,\
    \ and is the go-to example of philosophical objectivy.\n\nWhy should morality\
    \ be different from these other human creations? This is my question for Pro.\n"

    \ minds of humans because we made it up and decided to abide by them. It is only\
    \ because you and other people decide these rules have meaning, that they\u2019\
    re worth following. They do not exist objectively. But the game its self encourages\
    \ analytical moves based on limited patterns.\n- Mathematics - Mathematics is\
    \ a form of science that uses advanced formulas to support conclusions based on\
    \ concrete data and follows a method of empiricism to obtain reliable results.\n\
    \nMorality is unlike either of these two because it follows no such structure\
    \ and is liable to change on a whim. It is based only on your own personal feelings\
    \ validating what you believe to be right or wrong, and whether this conforms\
    \ with society\u2019s expectations.\n\nThese value judgments follow no objective\
    \ criteria and are based mostly on cultural religions & ethics.\n\nAs William\
    \ Craig points out.:\n\n**l. Theism provides a consistent framework for objective\
    \ moral values.**\\\nTheism ultimately provides a basis to determine the meaning\
    \ of something, the rules that people should follow, and ways in which humans\
    \ are to act.\n\n**If God does not exist, there is no foundation for objective\
    \ moral values.**\\\nIf God does not exist, what then is to make one person\u2019\
    s sense of right and wrong objectively superior to another man\u2019s sense of\
    \ right and wrong?\n\nWhat do we base objective moral values on?\n\nQuestions\
    \ Con must answer.:\n\n1. **What is an example of objective morals? Can Con prove\
    \ these morals are objectively correct?**\n2. **Without anyone to guide us, how\
    \ do we arrive at our own conclusion of objective morality without a metaphorical\
    \ internal or external compass?**\n"

    \ My position is not that a quantity of people makes something objective, but\
    \ that a quality of objectivity is that it is less ambiguous - an interpreter\
    \ isn't required. Opinions aren\u2019t always clear and can\u2019t always be followed\
    \ by everyone, but an objective standard removes opinion from the equation and\
    \ allows for many (or any) unbiased, honest individuals to arrive at more or less\
    \ the same answer.\n\n> For morality to have any objective value and meaning,\
    \ it requires a divine power with sentience assigning it such. Otherwise, there\
    \ is no significance.\n\n**This** is an argument from assertion. For Pro to earn\
    \ the favor of voters, he needs to do the impossible: explain how the opinions\
    \ of a divine individual qualify as an objective standard while also being incongruous\
    \ with the definitions he provided for Objective and objective morality.\n\n>\

    t see the relevance, why did he mention dolphins and sharks?\n\nThe point is to\
    \ demonstrate that animals are primitive and barbaric, but the idea of morality\
    \ is a human concept. Animals having empathy is not the same as knowing and understanding\
    \ morality.\n\n> _\u201CMy opponent would have us question seemingly altruistic\
    \ dolphin actions, but uncritically accept nefarious motives where it suits his\
    \ argument. You can\u2019t have it both ways there, sir. \u201C_\n\nIt\u2019s\
    \ true. <https://centerforsurfresearch.org/do-dolphins-attack-humans/>\n\nWhales\
    \ and dolphins are wild animals at the end of the day. Whales are known to snap\
    \ and try to drown their trainers at SeaWorld. In the ocean, dolphins regularly\
    \ do the same to divers or swimmers.\n\n> _\u201CUnfortunately, male humans have\
    \ been known to rape as well. I'm still interested to know what theistic framework\
    \ my opponent is using to deem dolphin rape immoral. If one can\u2019t be provided,\
    \ then Sir.Lancelot has no legitimate objection to dolphin rape.\u201D_\n\nMost\
    \ theistic scripture declare that animals are barbaric and that is why humans\
    \ are seen as superior. As I have previously pointed out, morality is a human\
    \ concept, and animals do not understand morality. Therefore, animals not being\
    \ held to the same standard is consistent with my original points.\n\nBecause\
    \ humans recognize that rape is abhorrent, rapists are locked away and cast out\
    \ because they\u2019re a threat to society. Majority of humans do not rape while\
    \ rape is normalized in the dolphin species.\n\nIn Greek Mythology, Ares killed\
    \ Poseidon\u2019s son for raping his daughter.\n\n> _\u201CIt\u2019s not clear\
    \ what Pro thinks is false. Does he think his question didn\u2019t have the answer\
    \ built in? ...or does he disagree objectivity allows everyone to follow without\
    \ the need for personal opinions? He goes on to give a confused argument involving\
    \ incest, cannibalism, and objective revulsion (whatever that is). Long story\
    \ short, humanity arbitrarily deciding morality and revulsion (given that it is\
    \ an emotion) aren\u2019t objective nor part of my argument. This is a strawman.\
    \ I\u2019m more than willing to set this ablaze with Pro.\u201D_\n\nThis is a\
    \ contradiction, as Con states the foundation for objective morality is human\
    \ minds.\n\n> _\u201C1. Using the definition of objective morality provided in\
    \ the debate description (Right and wrong exist factually, without any importance\
    \ of opinion) my opposition has not provided an objective moral theory. Morality\
    \ dependent on the opinion of a divine authority would fail to qualify as objective.\
    \ Sir.Lancelot is advocating a form of subjective morality._\n\n> _2. Pro misrepresents\
    \ my argument. My position is not that a quantity of people makes something objective,\
    \ but that a quality of objectivity is that it is less ambiguous - an interpreter\
    \ isn't required. Opinions aren\u2019t always clear and can\u2019t always be followed\
    \ by everyone, but an objective standard removes opinion from the equation and\
    \ allows for many (or any) unbiased, honest individuals to arrive at more or less\
    \ the same answer.\u201D_\n\nThe perfect example we have for this are **laws.**\n\
    \nBut laws are not objective morals and the law gets misinterpreted all the time.\
    \ People understanding that rape is wrong has not stopped people from getting\
    \ confused about a man sleeping with a woman who was too intoxicated to consent,\
    \ using excuses that she said it was okay.\n\nEven sexual harassment, while clearly\
    \ wrong, is still so common in workplaces that employers need to establish and\
    \ closely define boundaries for increased compliance.\n\nIn-fact, it would seem\
    \ that more \u201Cobjective standards\u201D leads to more and more confusion.\
    \ So I respectfully reject Con\u2019s assertion that humans are capable of creating\
    \ and defining objective morality.\n\n> _\u201CWith relevance to the individual\
    \ being quoted (William Lane Craig), I asked for a consistent and unchanging Biblical\
    \ \\[Christian\\] position regarding slavery, rape o r genocide. No such standard\
    \ was provided. For Pro to be victorious in this debate, he should be able to\
    \ show his argument isn\u2019t just hollow words. What is the consistent theistic\
    \ framework Christians use to condemn slavery in the modern world while the Bible\
    \ condones it?\u201D_\n\nThis argument isn\u2019t as significant as my other ones,\
    \ that even dropping it completely wouldn\u2019t severely impact my case.\n\n\
    As I\u2019m not defending one religion, Christianity only follows the rules and\
    \ laws set forth by the New Testament. It was repeatedly declared in the Old Testament\
    \ that the Messiah\u2019s arrival would change everything. I could certainly be\
    \ wrong, but scripture has not deviated from this point.\n\nI\u2019m not as biblically\
    \ literate as William Craig.\n\n> _\u201CI find this statement alarming. So far\
    \ as I know there are no objectively verifiable words from a divine being, much\
    \ less words which mandate rescuing drowning people. Does Pro believe there is\
    \ no incentive to save a fellow human besides obedience? Obedience is not the\
    \ same thing as morality.\u201D_\n\nMuch of morality is **obedience.**\n\nDo the\
    \ majority of people refuse to steal product/merchandise from stores or gas stations\
    \ because they know it\u2019s wrong or is it the fear of punishment?\n\nExceptions\
    \ exist, but most men and women in failing relationships or marriages that don\u2019\
    t cheat don\u2019t do it out of devotion, respect, or faithfulness to their partners,\
    \ but because of society\u2019s stigmatization and scrutiny.\n\nWhen a man is\
    \ drafted to a war he doesn\u2019t support/believe in, instead of staying with\
    \ his family, he has an obligation to defend his country. This obligation is fulfilled\
    \ even if it goes against his wants, desires, and personal beliefs in order to\
    \ preserve his reputation and avoid being called a coward for life.\n\n> _\u201C\
    We\u2019ve already agreed morality is a social construct. However, so are definitions\
    \ like \u201Cobjective\u201D. This objection has no teeth.\u201D_\n\nThe semantics\
    \ of the term \u2018objective\u2019 and \u2018morality\u2019 have a place in public\
    \ discourse. Assertions of objective morality without clear standards of objectivity\
    \ or morality do not.\n\n> _\u201CSuch blatant dishonesty is not normally seen\

  content: "Thank you for an interesting debate, Sir.Lancelot!\n\nLooking at the debate\
    \ proposition and putting all distraction aside, we need only determine if Pro\
    \ has established Objective morality is impossible in the absence of divine power.\
    \ What substantiation has pro provided? Let us look:\n\n**o Without a divine creator,\
    \ we have no framework for which to judge moral values.\u201D**\n\nI showed a\
    \ higher power is not required for objectivity by providing examples of philosophical\
    \ objectivity sans divinity. (Mathematics, rules of chess, science, etc.) Pro\
    \ did not argue against science and mathematics being objective. Instead, he argued\
    \ they were different because they are structured. I pointed out the flawed reasoning:\
    \ structure has no relation to objectivity. When he provided an irrelevant quote\
    \ as a rebuttal to this point, he dropped his defense of the supposed structure/objectivity\
    \ connection. My examples of objectivity in human creations without divine authority\
    \ stand as does my point.\n\n**o Theism provides a consistent framework for objective\
    \ morals**\n\nSince Pro was appealing to a well-known Christian debater, I assumed\
    \ Christianity was his preferred form of theism. When I asked about the inconsistencies\
    \ of Christianity, Pro ultimately retreated it from it as an \u201Cconsistent\
    \ theistic framework\u201D. This would have been no problem if Pro had provided\
    \ a specific example backing his assertions. He did not do this. Instead, my interlocutor\
    \ backed away from specifics as though it were the hot stove he just got burned\
    \ by.\n\nBeyond Pro\u2019s lack of a substantive positive case, there is also\
    \ the inadequate defense against my challenges.\n\n**o Obedience and morality:**\n\
    \nI showed how obedience can require different actions than morality and are two\
    \ different things. There was a two pronged attacked here:\n\n1. If morality is\
    \ just obedience, then where are the objective rules? Pro made no attempt to provide\
    \ an objective set of rules. Assuming morality were just obedience, then the absence\
    \ of rules would mean his morality could not be objective.\n2. If pro is advocating\
    \ for something other than morality (like, say, obedience) then objective or not,\
    \ he is obviously not building up a case for objective morality or meeting his\
    \ burden.\n\n**o Divine morality:**\n\nSir.Lancelot was asked how morality built\
    \ on the opinions of a subject (divine or not) could qualify as objective. No\
    \ response was provided. Quite simply, morality isn\u2019t made objective by appealing\
    \ to the ultimate subject. \u201CDivine authority\u201D does nothing to make morality\
    \ objective. Once again, Pro has failed to uphold his burden.\n\nAs for my opponent\u2019\
    s final round, he completely abandons the proposition he is meant to support and\
    \ gives away the debate. He is no longer arguing objective morality, divine authority,\
    \ objectivity or even morality. Instead, he has come to endorse a position where\
    \ God and morality are non-existent further undermining his position for this\
    \ debate. This should be seen as an obvious concession. Vote Con!\n"

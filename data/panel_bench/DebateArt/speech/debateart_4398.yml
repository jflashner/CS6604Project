  content: "**Preamble:**\\\nTo evaluate usefulness to society, I will compare STEM\
    \ and Liberal Arts on various metrics. By any meaningful measure, someone can\
    \ offer much more value to society with a STEM degree than they can with a Liberal\
    \ Arts degree.\n\n**1. Value of Skills Learned**\\\nSkills Taught in STEM\\\n\
    STEM classes prepare students to develop new technology and scientific theories\u2014\
    with the rate at which technology is [rapidly advancing](https://www.zippia.com/advice/how-fast-is-technology-advancing/#:~:text=Is%20technology%20growing%20exponentially%3F,longer%2C%20it's%20true%20for%20now),\
    \ Liberal Arts majors can\u2019t possibly keep up. New AI models such as [Chat\
    \ GPT](https://www.pcguide.com/apps/what-is-chat-gpt/) can accomplish the same\
    \ things as essayists in a fraction of the time. STEM teaches students to develop\
    \ _new_ things\u2014and once they are developed, they can be mass produced. STEM\
    \ skills always remain relevant, because new technology can always be developed.\n\
    \nSkills Taught in Liberal Arts\\\nLiberal Arts classes teach students skills\
    \ that will likely be unnecessary in twenty years. Before computers had spellcheck,\
    \ being good with language was a big focus. Today, plenty of Liberal Arts majors\
    \ learn how to write convincingly\u2014and it won\u2019t be long before Chat GPT\
    \ or some other program can do better than them. AI can already [crush the bar\
    \ exam](https://www.cnet.com/tech/chatgpt-can-pass-the-bar-exam-does-that-actually-matter/#:~:text=In%20mid%2DMarch%2C%20artificial%20intelligence,score%20in%20the%20top%2010%25).\
    \ In essence, Liberal Arts majors continue to learn skills that STEM majors are\
    \ making obsolete.\n\n**2. Contributions to Economic Growth**\\\nMarket Demand\
    \ for STEM Skills\\\nThe demand for STEM skills [continues to grow](https://www.unsw.edu.au/news/2019/03/stem-skills-in-demand).\
    \ However, these skills are in [short supply](https://www.brookings.edu/interactives/still-searching-job-vacancies-and-stem-skills/),\
    \ meaning that anyone with a STEM degree has huge potential to help the economy.\n\
    \nImportance of STEM at Large Companies\\\nQualified STEM majors [are essential](https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/sparking-more-sparks)\
    \ in helping companies to grow and solve problems. As technology grows, so does\
    \ the demand for technicians who can maintain them. The demand for \u201Cskilled\
    \ labor\u201D has become a common thread at these companies\u2014and the lack\
    \ thereof is the bottleneck that limits innovation.\n\n**3. Opportunities for\
    \ Innovation**\\\nThe innovation coming from STEM fields gives strong evidence\
    \ for their utility. Humanities don\u2019t offer anywhere near the same level\
    \ of innovation. To illustrate this point, I will focus on technological and scientific\
    \ developments from the past century.\n\nNew Technology\n\n- Computers\n- Mobile\
    \ Phones (and Smartphones)\n- Internet\n- Flash Drives\n- LED Light Bulbs\n- MP3\
    \ Players\n- Digital Cameras\n- [Source](https://www.londonip.co.uk/20-groundbreaking-inventions-from-the-last-100-years/)\n\
    \nScientific Contributions\n\n- Antibiotics\n- Vaccines for polio, measles, mumps,\
    \ rubella, and chickenpox\n- Blood Storage\n- MRIs\n- HIV Therapy\n- The Human\
    \ Genome Project\n- [Source](https://www.viome.com/blog/celebrating-greatest-scientific-discoveries-last-century-and-future)\n\
    \n**4. Potential for Charitable Contributions**\\\nSalary Differences\\\nSTEM\
    \ majors make an average salary of [$82,793](https://www.zippia.com/science-technology-and-society-major/salary/).\
    \ Liberal Arts majors make an average salary of [$39,349](https://www.zippia.com/liberal-arts-major/salary/).\
    \ When global charities are considered, these salary differences add up. Top charities\
    \ can [save a life](https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities) for just\
    \ $5,000. If nothing else, a STEM major can afford to save 8-9 more lives per\
    \ year than a Liberal Arts major.\n\n**5. Finding Solutions to Global Problems**\\\
    \nSTEM research has saved billions of lives globally. Compared to scientific and\
    \ technological advancements, the combined impact of Liberal Arts majors is negligible.\n\
    \nAgriculture\\\nImprovements in agricultural technology during the Green Revolution\
    \ saved [billions of lives](https://www.americanexperiment.org/earth-day-how-this-u-of-m-grad-saved-one-billion-lives-and-the-planet-with-science/).\
    \ We can credit Norman Borlaug, a STEM major, for a good chunk of that.\n\nMedicine\\\
    \nOver [half of all deaths globally](https://ourworldindata.org/what-are-children-dying-from-and-what-can-we-do-about-it)\
    \ are caused by disease. The Covid vaccine alone [saved millions of lives](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations#:~:text=on%20our%20methods.-,Findings,million%20more%20COVID%2D19%20infections).\n"

    \ depending on LA to have a successful impact. As STEM renders certain LA skills\
    \ obsolete, new skills will be taught and in demand.\n\n**Communication**\n\n\
    Public Relations- This career path requires a combination of strong writing and\

    \ for increasing interaction and engagement for newer companies falls **directly**\
    \ on this job. Annual Salary = $63,000\n\nAdvertising & Marketing- Algorithms\
    \ cannot adjust to the abilities required for this job. This role requires a strong\
    \ knowledge of consumers and your target demographic. Advertising generally takes\
    \ the form of launching product-based websites or projecting through television\
    \ and radio. As such, this makes this one of the hardest jobs to be successful\
    \ at.\\\nAnnual Salary = $132,000\n\nGraphic Design- Creating logos, character\
    \ mascots, book covers or the ability to sell products through creative artwork\
    \ will always remain an essential skill not replaceable by a STEM degree. Photography,\
    \ cartoons, and animation is covered with this job. Manually creating business\
    \ websites or custom templates are always in demand. Annual Salary = $51,000\n\
    \nThat said, doctors that know a variety of languages can better communicate with\
    \ immigrants in order to uncover symptoms and address them accordingly.\n\nDiplomacy\
    \ is a strong communication skill which is necessary for addressing foreign disputes,\
    \ communicating issues & solutions for economic prosperity, and resolving war\
    \ conflicts through words and civility. Something STEM is simply unable to do.\n\
    \n**Psychology**\\\nLet me ask a rhetorical question.: _Just how many deaths are\
    \ caused by substance abuse and violent crime?_\n\nMental Health & Substance Abuse-\
    \ Counselors and psychologists who treat alcoholism and cocaine addiction can\
    \ work on reducing the amount of deaths caused by DUI\u2019s, or overall actively\
    \ working to stop domestic abuse cases. Even stopping suicides caused by depression.\\\
    \nAnnual Salary = $50,000\n\n- Psychology is of critical importance in profiling\
    \ serial criminals and proactively stopping murders before they happen. The best\
    \ cure is prevention.\n\n**Sociology**\n\nSocial Worker- Society needs experts\
    \ capable of holding parents accountable and identifying toxic environments to\
    \ children, because they have a duty to keep a child safe and the only way to\
    \ ensure the next generation succeeds is through properly raising the youth. Children\
    \ with personality disorders and autism may not be receiving the help they need,\
    \ in education or social interaction.\\\nAnnual Salary = $40,000 - $80,000\n\n\
    Lawyer- Lawyers are required to manage custody battles, property settlements over\
    \ divorce disputes, settling debt, overcoming workplace harassment, prosecuting\
    \ criminals, and overall protecting innocent people from wrongful persecution.\\\
    \nAnnual Salary = $117,000\n\nLikewise, correctional officers are required to\
    \ assist the progress of convicts into successful reform, so they can return to\

  content: "**Framework:**\\\nOn balance\\\nCon largely ignores the \u201Con balance\u201D\
    \ part of the resolution, cherry picking certain careers that address societal\
    \ issues with high salaries. Not everyone in Liberal Arts will go into public\
    \ relations. Not everyone can become a lawyer.\n\nTotal Impact\\\nThere are two\
    \ ways to try and address the comparable impact between these two types of degrees:\n\
    \n1. [Marginal benefit](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/marginal-benefit-formula/)\
    \ - What is the incremental benefit to society available from one new degree of\
    \ this kind?\n2. Net impact - What kinds of major advances have been accomplished\
    \ by people with each type of degree when their skills are combined?\n\nI have\
    \ no doubt that many of the careers Con listed _attempt_ to address societal issues,\
    \ but they\u2019re simply not as effective as STEM. On balance, STEM degrees are\
    \ better at (1) and (2).\n\nI\u2019ve listed a few examples for (2) that have\
    \ gone uncontested, so I think it\u2019s clear that STEM edges ahead in solving\
    \ global problems.\n\n**Rebuttals:**\\\n\u201CAnnual Salary\u201D\n\n- As I pointed\
    \ out already, _on balance,_ the salary from STEM is much greater than the salary\
    \ from Liberal Arts.\n\n\u201CPublic Relations / Advertising & Marketing\u201D\
    \n\n- The marginal benefit here is questionable. How many PR people are actually\
    \ The technology developed by someone with a STEM major is unquestionably more\
    \ important than the reputation of any one particular company.\n- Con also assumes\
    \ that PR is a net benefit, when it is often harmful. The companies with the best\
    \ products should rise to the top, not those with the slickest advertisers.\n\
    - [Theranos](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020116/theranos-fallen-unicorn.asp)\
    \ had great PR but horrible technology, consisting mostly of graphic designers\
    \ instead of medical experts. Elizabeth Holmes focused on PR instead of finishing\
    \ her STEM degree, and as a result, Theranos endangered hundreds of thousands\
    \ of consumers.\n\n\u201CGraphic Design...will always remain an essential skill\
    \ not replaceable by a STEM degree.\u201D\n\n- No, [it won\u2019t](https://www.wired.com/story/picture-limitless-creativity-ai-image-generators/).\
    \ AI can already make better artwork than most humans.\n- I also think that medical\
    \ advances and technological developments that dramatically alleviate poverty\
    \ are generally more of a benefit to humanity than artwork that looks cool.\n\
    - And finally, who developed the computers that these graphic designers are relying\
    \ on?\n\n\u201Cdoctors that know a variety of languages can better communicate\
    \ with immigrants in order to uncover symptoms and address them accordingly\u201D\
    \n\n- You can learn a language better by simply living in that country or practicing\
    \ than by getting a Liberal Arts degree.\n- I\u2019d also rather be treated by\
    \ a doctor who only speaks one language than a language translator with no experience\
    \ in medicine\u2014different doctors speak different languages, we don\u2019t\
    \ need one doctor speaking five of them.\n\n\u201CDiplomacy is a strong communication\
    \ skill which is necessary for addressing foreign disputes\u201D\n\n- Few Liberal\
    \ Arts majors will rise to this level of importance\n- It\u2019s doubtful that\
    \ a Liberal Arts degree actually helps much in these kinds of situations. Some\
    \ people are simply more charismatic than others.\n- We only need a dozen or so\
    \ diplomats\u2014the supply vastly outweighs the demand. It\u2019s also doubtful\
    \ that the best people get selected for the job, since political elections rely\
    \ heavily on luck.\n- It\u2019s often hard to predict the interests of a country,\
    \ or even to predict whether those interests align with those that are beneficial\
    \ to society. Hillary Clinton majored in political science and then [voted for\
    \ the Iraq War](https://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/hillary-clinton-iraq-war-vote-mistake-iowa-118109),\
    \ which turned out to be a huge blunder.\n- Foreign policy isn\u2019t going to\
    \ change much whether the country has 10,000 Liberal Arts Majors or 10,000,000.\n\
    - Meanwhile, a scientist helping to develop new kinds of medicine has a stronger\
    \ guarantee that their research will actually help people.\n\n\u201CSocial Worker\u201D\
    \n\n- I\u2019ll admit there\u2019s a positive influence on society here, but not\
    \ one comparable to STEM degrees.\n- [Pediatricians](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?contenttypeid=85&contentid=P01054#:~:text=A%20pediatrician%20is%20a%20medical,for%20children%20after%20hospital%20discharge)\

    \ by psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, and most researchers developing new treatments\
    \ for autism are psychiatrists as well.\n- Becoming a psychiatrist requires a\
    \ very [STEM-heavy](https://blog.collegevine.com/how-to-become-a-psychiatrist/)\
    \ course load, and most psychiatrists major in a STEM major out of convenience.\
    \ Psychiatry is STEM, not Liberal Arts.\n\n\u201CLawyer\u201D\n\n- This is largely\
    \ a zero-sum game, since lawyers specialize in arguing with other lawyers. Double\
    \ the amount of lawyers in society, and very little will change.\n- Most public\

    \ it\u2019s not clear whether a lawyer should become a prosecutor or a defense\
    \ lawyer, or if either of those are more beneficial to society.\n- Becoming a\
    \ lawyer is [very difficult](https://testmaxprep.com/blog/lsat/how-hard-is-law-school?v=3)\
    \ and requires extra years of schooling. A CS major, for example, has a better\
    \ guarantee of making a similar salary which can be donated to the same causes.\n\
    \n\u201Ccorrectional officers/Career counselors\u201D\n\n- I don\u2019t think\
    \ that more career officers = better results. Most schools that are interested\
    \ in having career counselors can easily get one.\n- A career counselor or correctional\
    \ office is also a very small fraction of the influence that someone has, only\
    \ meeting with them for small periods and often just to check in. Parents/friends/acquaintances\
    \ are largely going to determine the positive influences someone has and there\
    \ won\u2019t be much room for the Liberal Arts major to make a huge difference.\n"

    \n**Conclusion:**\n\n- It seems that Con has simply given a list of Liberal Arts\
    \ degrees and named the problems they are supposed to solve, without showing how\
    \ effective those degrees are or comparing them to the benefits of STEM degrees.\n\
    - Con has provided a total of two sources, both of which are simply definitions\
    \ of a number of Liberal Arts jobs, and neither of which actually give a measure\
    \ of how helpful they are to society.\n- Voting policy holds that source points\
    \ should be given \u201Cto the side that (with a strong quality lead) better supported\
    \ their case with relevant outside evidence and/or analysis thereof.\u201D\n-\
    \ Con may provide all sorts of _new_ arguments and evidence that I will then be\
    \ _unable to respond to_, but voters should [dismiss them](https://info.debateart.com/terms-of-service/voting-policy).\n"

    > No one does anything purely because it is good or the right thing to do.


    Someone apologizes to someone else for doing something wrong. Explain this scenario.
    Why else would the person apologize?


    Lifeguard point


    A lifeguard saving someone does make it good because they wouldn''t want someone''s
    death on their conscience. They are saving people because it is both their job
    and because it''s good. If a lifeguard saves someone only because it''s their
    job, in other words if they were off the clock and not on lifeguard duty, and
    they see a person drowning and decide not to save them, well that''s pretty messed
    up and heartless. I would hope not all lifeguards are like that. What about the
    case for someone who isn''t a lifeguard but knows how to swim, and they save a
    person from drowning?


    By your logic: Firefighters do not save people from burning buildings because
    it is good, they are only doing it because it is their job. Similar to lifeguards,
    is that true as well?


    > If a man saves a child from a burning building, but tells no one about it, it
    is still a selfish act as he is doing it to keep the child''s death off of his
    conscience.


    The ''child''s death'' part confused me because you said the man saved the child.
    Could you explain? If that man doesn''t tell anyone about it, I would see it as
    a humble act, not a selfish act. By saving someone''s life, people see that as
    a great thing, So he would rather not receive all that attention and be known
    and praised as a hero. He would be proud of himself and keep it to himself. The
    average person would most likely tell everyone that they saved someone from a
    burning building.


    **My Argument**


    Everyone''s different


    You can''t put everyone in the same box. There are people, such as myself who
    would rather give than receive. Although it''s nice to receive, I, nor some other
    people don''t expect anything in return. I know many people like this. When I
    do something for my friends or family, I do it out of the kindness of my heart,
    not to get something right back. I''m not the type to say "Well I did this for
    you so you need to do this." It''s good to give to others but you have to make
    sure you are good yourself. If you give too much into others and forget about
    yourself, that''s not good. Because at the end of the day, you come first. Again,
    when I say "you come first" that does not correlate to selfishness.


    **Definitions**


    **Selfish** - lacking consideration for others; concerned chiefly with one''s
    own personal profit or pleasure.\

    **Selfless** - concerned more with the needs and wishes of others than with one''s
    own; unselfish.


    Selfish vs Selfless


    I take it that you think being selfless is wrong, correct? If I''m off, please
    let me know. I see selfish is bad and selfless as good, but we may be on the same
    page. Anyhow, it''s good to give to others, and you deserve gratification from
    it. Gratification can simply be just feeling good afterwards, or a simple "Thank
    you". If one does a selfless act and feels gratification from it, how does that
    make them selfish? Are you familiar with the saying "What goes around comes around.
    " When you do good to people, good things happen to you. When you do bad things
    to people, bad things happen to you.


    What about parents?


    It''s a parent''s job to take care of their children, they are supposed to be
    selfless. By raising a child correctly and teaching them respect, that''s gratification
    enough to the parent. Back to the ''selfish'' aspect, the parent shouldn''t expect
    anything from the child as far as exchange. Does this make parents selfish? If
    your argument has nothing to do with this and if parents don''t count, then dismiss
    this point.


    Good or bad?


    Your stance is basically: "No matter what you do for others, there is something
    you are getting out of it." correct?\

    Is that a bad thing? I understand that you say this isn''t a bad thing, and it''s
    a good thing that people do good things for others, but to use the word "selfish"
    doesn''t work. It''s not a good thing to be selfish. If someone does good for
    someone else, what if the person deserves it in return? For example, Jane does
    something good for Bill. Time passes. Bill decides to do something good for Jane
    back, since she has done something good for him and she deserves it. Jane never
    asked Bill for anything though because being the type of person Jane is, she doesn''t
    expect anything in return.


    Await a response.

  content: 'It is still selfish if they do it to keep if off the conscience. They
    are not a bad person for this because it''s a completely natural desire to not
    feel guilty, but it is still technically selfish as they are thinking of them
    self.


    About the man saving the child: they save the child to keep their death off their
    conscience. If they did not care about the child''s death being on their conscience,
    that would mean they don''t care about the child''s death. Therefore, they would
    not save the child. My point is all of this goes back to the selfish and natural
    desire to not feel guilty about someone''s death. If they did not care, they wouldn''t
    save the child, simple as that.


    Everyone''s different: But why do you do the kind thing? Think about it. What
    is your purpose? I''m not saying I don''t understand why; I understand completely.
    There are multiple reasons why you might have done a kind thing for your friends
    and family even if you don''t expect to get something back:\

    One reason is: You enjoy seeing them happy: You gave something or did something
    for them because you like to see them happy. Though this sounds like a selfless
    act, it can''t be. You enjoy seeing them happy. Though you may not realize it,
    you are doing this for yourself because you enjoy seeing them happy. After all,
    if you didn''t like seeing them happy, you wouldn''t do it.


    Selfish vs Selfless: No, I do not see being selfish as good or being selfless
    as bad. I just see selfishness as natural and selflessness as unrealistic. With
    gratification, the person is doing the act to feel the gratification of it, therefore
    making them concerned for themselves. As for "what goes around comes around",
    a person may do a "selfless" act purely because they feel karma will reward them,
    making them selfish.


    Parents: A parent raises their child well, and they feel good about it. They can
    say "I''m a good parent. " If they''re having a bad day, thinking "What have I
    done that''s important? ", they can remember that they raised a child well, and
    they can believe they did something good. Now, This does not make the parent a
    bad person whatsoever. This just makes the parent human.


    Good or bad? : No, it is not a bad thing. It is only the natural thing. It is
    impossible to do anything good without thinking of yourself. That''s just life,
    it''s natural, And I won''t criticize it. Jane may have done something good, but
    it still benefits her. She feels the gratification of her good deed. She doesn''t
    ask for anything back because she believes that will make her look selfish and
    that it will take away from her good deed, which means it will take away from
    her gratification.


    My argument: Good deeds give people an excuse. When someone does something good,
    they may then think that they should reward themselves. After all, they did something
    good. If someone says they''re a bad person or selfish, they can say "Well I did
    this, so you''re wrong." And when they think that their life has been a waste,
    they can remember the good thing they did.


    Note: Some people seem to think that I''m some sort of amoral person, believing
    that good isn''t real and all people are bad and that I''m only projecting myself
    on others. This isn''t true. People are not inherently bad. To be selfish is to
    be human, and I can''t criticize that. I just accept that in life people are concerned
    with themselves, and that''s just a fact.

    > The only reason people do nice things is because they want to and/or they like

    What''s wrong with that? How does that make them selfish?


    > If someone doesn''t want/like to do nice things, they won''t do it.


    And that''s their choice, everyone is different.


    A person apologizing


    So are you basically saying people who apologize aren''t genuine? There are people
    who genuinely apologize and there are others that have fake apologies.


    When I said _"selfish people usually expect a large scale things in return."_
    that''s an understatement. Everyone knows this. When you think of a selfish person,
    that''s what they want. This goes with the definition. Because they are exclusively
    interested in what they want, they expect something in return since it''s for
    them.


    > A person who says "no need to thank me" is more likely to receive something
    in return


    But that doesn''t mean they would want something in return.


    > The mother isn''t selfish because they received something back. The mother is
    inherently selfish, as all people are.


    So it''s "she isn''t selfish" and then it''s she''s "inherently selfish" which
    one is it? In any case, that does not make her selfish at all. The mother did
    not expect the daughter to do buy her a new home and the mother did not ask for
    it either. By your logic and how your arguments are structured, she is selfish
    regardless.


    **"People only do good things for selfish reasons."**


    1. Mother takes care of daughter, as she should. \[does good thing for selfish
    reason. Mother expects daughter to do something for her in return\]

    2. Daughter buys mother a house once she gets older. \[this means the mother is
    now selfish since the daughter did something in return for her\]


    > First of all, where did I say I didn''t accept it at one point?


    I''ll assess your statement, _"I just accept that in life people are concerned
    with themselves"_


    1. It seems as though you didn''t believe or accept it at first, but your mind
    was changed.

    2. You say that as if it is a bad thing that you have to accept people being concerned
    with themselves.

    3. If you always believed that, then why use the word accept? That''s like someone
    saying _"I just have to accept the fact that humans breathe oxygen"_ as if that
    person once thought it was false at one time. I just answered the rest of your
    questions with these explanations.


    Accept/Acceptance - a person''s assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing
    a process or condition without attempting to change it or protest it.


    But if I am wrong or if I took what you said completely left field, then explain
    and let me know. That''s just what I took from what you said.


    > Where did you do this? I don''t see any example, all I see are definitions and
    explanations of the definition.


    I meant that example definition from my source, but I will use a real example:
    Self-interest is essential for your happiness and well being. It enables you to
    provide food and shelter for you and your family. Self-interest is necessary for
    your economic and career success. That is quoted from the same source from R2.


    > Sure, unless doing something good for other people benefits them.


    And what exactly is wrong with that? Doing something good for someone else should
    benefit you. You do good for others and something good is dealt back to you even
    if it''s something as feeling good afterwards. I know your premise isn''t good
    or bad and that it''s just human but again, the way you structure everything,
    you say it like it''s bad. I understand it can be something small and not obvious
    but in this specific situation, this does not make someone selfish. It''s just
    a nice person or a person that does a good humanly act.


    > Another thing to understand about my point is that people don''t even understand
    their own reasoning. While they think they care about others, they are, in actuality,
    only caring about themselves. What they think they''re doing when they care about
    others is really just them benefiting themselves.


    Not a fair thing to say. You are basically saying everyone isn''t genuine. Again,
    everyone is different. There are people who care about others. If a person drives
    by a homeless person on the street begging for money and that person gives that
    homeless person their hard earned money, does that really constitute them not
    caring about the homeless person but only carrying about themselves? Keep in mind,
    this is their hard earned money.


    What about doctors? Are they not genuine? Some of them genuinely love their jobs
    and they care for human life. Not all doctors are doing it only for the money.
    Keyword, I said only. That isn''t selfishness. Because everyone needs to find
    a way to take care of themselves and to make a living. This ties into self-interest.
    Some doctors or nurses love their jobs, but of course the money is a plus and
    it is a must.


    There is a cause and effect for everything. You are using the word selfish in
    way too many situations where different words belong in.

    Yes, but they might not expect something in return from the other person. Maybe

    This is just cause and effect. Has nothing to do with selfishness, along with

    Just like people don''t accept the earth being flat, but some unfortunately do.

    As I''ve said multiple times as well, I understand that you are saying it''s nothing
    wrong with it and it''s not bad but again, as I said a few times 1. The way your
    arguments are structured screams that it''s bad. 2. This is a debate and we are
    on opposing sides, so I''m coming in with the mindset of you arguing your opinion
    and me arguing mine. Let''s look at the simple fact that you are in fact saying
    it is human nature and it''s nothing wrong at all that "People do good things
    for selfish reasons." alright, but the thing is, that statement is simply not
    true. First off, that statement alone contradicts itself and secondly, not every
    person on the planet applies to your ''selfish'' argument/stance.


    > I said: Does that really constitute them not caring about the homeless person
    but only carrying about themselves?\

    > You said: Yes. They act in their own self-interest. They aren''t bad for this,
    it''s just who they are.


    No, they do care about the homeless person. That''s why they gave their money
    to them. I''d say they care more about the homeless person than themselves in
    this situation. I notice you said self-interest, so in this situation this means
    that they are not selfish, correct? If so, then we both agree on that. A selfish
    person wouldn''t give their money to a homeless person since they are giving _their_
    money away to them.


    > People are genuine if they believe they are. But the underlying truth is that
    people do things for themselves only, even if those things benefit others and
    even if they don''t know it.


    Are you saying no one''s truly genuine? Your arguments stem from motives and doubtfulness.
    If a person goes to work every day, that would be them doing things for themselves
    so you''re right in that aspect.


    > When people do things for others, they don''t realize it, but they are doing
    it because it benefits them, not the other person.


    Again, this goes back to what I said earlier. These do not apply to everyone and
    these do not mean selfishness. Another thing, in this situation it could benefit
    both. A person can be doing something to not only benefit themselves but other
    people as well. Some celebrities pay for their fan''s student loans. The celebrity
    feels good afterwards and for the students, it''s more benefiting for them.

    That means that they are selfish


    "There was no point proven. You''ve said something simple. Everyone knows that
    people do things for other people is because they want to. This does not make
    someone selfish."\

    It does mean they are selfish because they are still getting something in return.


    "This is just cause and effect. Has nothing to do with selfishness, along with
    the two previous points."\

    I''m sorry but this is false. Where did cause and effect come from? That has nothing
    to do with this.


    "Just like people don''t accept the earth being flat, but some unfortunately do."\

    So what you are still implying is that people who are inherently selfish is not
    true, when it is true. I have proved this time and time again and you seem to
    not understand.


    "People do good things for selfish reasons." alright, but the thing is, that statement
    is simply not true. First off, that statement alone contradicts itself and secondly,
    not every person on the planet applies to your ''selfish'' argument/stance."\

    How does that statement contradict itself? Most people apply to my argument.


    "No, they do care about the homeless person. That''s why they gave their money
    to them. I''d say they care more about the homeless person than themselves in
    this situation. I notice you said self-interest, so in this situation this means
    that they are not selfish, correct? If so, then we both agree on that. A selfish
    person wouldn''t give their money to a homeless person since they are giving _their_
    money away to them."\

    No, this still means they are selfish because again, the reason they are giving
    their money away is to get something in return even if they don''t know it. Like
    I said, it could be something small as feeling good.


    "Are you saying no one''s truly genuine? Your arguments stem from motives and
    doubtfulness. If a person goes to work every day, that would be them doing things
    for themselves so you''re right in that aspect."\

    No one is truly genuine because at one point they can be selfish in certain situations.\

    "Again, this goes back to what I said earlier. These do not apply to everyone
    and these do not mean selfishness. Another thing, in this situation it could benefit
    both. A person can be doing something to not only benefit themselves but other
    people as well. Some celebrities pay for their fan''s student loans. The celebrity
    feels good afterwards and for the students, it''s more benefiting for them."\

    That would then make the celebrities selfish.

    No it doesn''t.


    > It does mean they are selfish because they are still getting something in return.


    Please look at the definition of selfish. Someone receiving something in return
    does not make them selfish.


    > I''m sorry but this is false. Where did cause and effect come from? That has
    nothing to do with this.


    This is merely cause and effect, Again, look at the definition of selfish.


    > How does that statement contradict itself? Most people apply to my argument.


    As I said, it doesn''t apply to everyone.


    > No, this still means they are selfish because again, the reason they are giving

    A selfish individual wouldn''t give away their money in the first place.


    > That would then make the celebrities selfish.


    No it doesn''t when they are helping others.


    Thanks for the debate.

  content: 'Just to clarify my position, I believe abortions should only be allowed
    if it''s within the first 5 months of pregnancy, or if the mother became pregnant
    outside of the mothers controls IE rape, condom breaks, birth control fails. Also,
    religious arguments will not be accepted as most religious arguments are very
    arbitrary and irrelevant.


    - Abortion is not killing if it''s done within the first 5 months of pregnancy
    as in the first 5 months, according to **sciencemag.org**, the fetus isn''t even
    sentient nor has any levels of intelligence. Therefore why should you care about
    a being that doesn''t experience pain nor has a consciousness? If your counter-argument
    is that at that point in development the fetus has a potential to be alive then
    you should be against masturbation or women not getting their ovulated eggs fertilized,
    or perhaps the unintentional killing of non sentient micro bacterial, Which in
    and of itself is utterly ridiculous.


    - Abortion can also be justified if the mother was raped or if a condom breaks.
    While these events are rare, They still happen and denying an abortion in these
    scenarios are unfair and possibly deadly if the women are underage. Forcing possibly
    a young girl to undergo a painful pregnancy which could scar her for life with
    disorders after just experiencing a traumatized rape is purely disgusting. Especially
    when more likely than not the girl in questions life will be ruined from having
    to take care of the baby, or the costly amount it is to raise the baby.


    - One of the biggest counter-arguments is that " Well if you don''t want to risk
    having a baby, don''t have sex,". I am convinced the majority of people who make
    these arguments have never come close to sex before as this is grossly inaccurate.
    By this logic we shouldn''t have a police force as " Well if you don''t want to
    be murdered, don''t go outside," or perhaps people shouldn''t swim since " well
    if you don''t want to drown, don''t swim". This logic is very arbitrary and ignorant.
    Besides abstinence, only education has proven itself to be rather ineffective
    as the sad reality is teenagers and adults are going to have sex for pleasure
    regardless. Abortions would in turn act as a safety net for the unfortunate people
    who got pregnant if a condom broke or birth control failed.


    - Case and point, Abortions are justifiable in certain scenarios and therefore
    should be legal in those situations whether it be the women were raped, If the
    mother would die in the baby''s birth, Or if it''s within the first 5 months when
    the fetus isn''t sentient.

    Points of contention.


    - Abortion is not ethical, moral, or good in any way.


    _At no point could the fetus be considered ''a blob of cells'' any more than a
    baby or a child. Babies are born without full consciousness and without autonomy,
    so it''s unreasonable to suggest we be able to murder a fetus without supporting
    infanticide. Ending a life prematurely is always immoral and comes burdened with
    implicit consequence, but such an action is justifiable through rationalization
    for many._


    - Abortion prior to 5 months is not justifiable.


    _Remaining consistent here, the little one is already distinct from the mother
    and father. At no point could he/she be considered just a blob of cells, unless
    humans themselves have no inherent value._


    - Abstinence is a reasonable method of countering pregnancy, discluding rape of
    course.


    _This is a self-explanatory position, I believe if people make the choice to have
    sex they accept the innate risk. It''s a common misconception that sex carries
    no inherent danger or responsibility when both are unavoidable and innate to intercourse._


    - Abortion is not a solution to rape and not ethical in cases of rape.


    _Abortion does not become a moral solution when rape comes into the picture. It''s
    still_ _abortion,_ _and still carries the same implications._


    - Abortion is not necessary


    _Abortion is not necessary or as effective as alternative birth methods such as
    c-section and vacuum extraction._

    Consciousness is far more important than the ability to feel pain. My mother struggles

    > Humans do have value for several different traits that human and life in general

    How about no, how about there is more to humanity than simple intelligence and
    sentience. The universe did not have to be here, nor did we; but it is, and we
    are. The purpose of life is to be found in existence itself. Depriving someone
    of such a pursuit is equivalent to a universal sin.


    > Even the most well behaved of men succumb to the primal urges to have sex for
    pleasure, this is why abortion should be legal too act as a safety net.


    We have several safety nets, here are the main 3: Condoms, Contraceptive, Monogomy.


    If the women chooses to avoid all 3 of these things, her pregnancy is the result
    of her own irresponsibility. As such, the baby should not be forced to pay for
    her mistakes.

    a fetus which may or may not damage her physically and mentally than to\

    > see an organism that most likely isn''t sentient yet to be terminated?


    I would like to see the rapist punished not the baby. The rapist is the one who
    forced the pregnancy on the women, and the blame lies exclusively upon him. Also,
    abortion harms both the mother and the child in a case like this further by perpetuating
    violence. It''s a simple misconception that even in cases like this the the welfare
    of the child and mother are opposed to eachother. \[2\]


    This is also an incredibly marginal case and we''re arguing for legality of abortion
    in general. If I conceded abortion in this circumstance is okay, would you then
    agree the other 99% of abortions are wrong? \[1\]


    > "C-sections are certainly not good for the well being of the mother as there

    I never said that C-section or Vacuum extractions were beneficial to the mother''s
    health. I was simply making the point that abortion isn''t necessary in the modern
    world to save lives. Most doctors estimate the amount of abortions that are needed
    to actually save a life is close to 1% or lower. \[3\]

    It seems you aren''t fully grasping my intended argument here. Many people feel

    - and in terms of pain, death would be a relief.


    The capacity to feel pain is almost irrelevant to the discussion of abortion.

    The idea here is that if the woman is using a condom, contraceptive, IUD, and

    > abortion itself doesn''t cause the mother to have the mental and physical toll
    that childbirth and pregnancy have on the mother. The only reason most mothers
    experience mental issues from abortion is due to society seeing it as immoral.


    The reason most mothers experience mental issues after abortion is because they
    don''t perceive the entity in a dehumanizing manner. It''s also tied to regret,

    Right, but it''s dangerous to take such an incredibly marginal case and assume

    so then should we just not have barriers or fences.


    " With this in mind, abortions fail as well. Sometimes with much more severe and

    - Abortion only fails 2-3 % of the time. Compared to the high chances of women
    feeling pain in pregnancy and birth, and possibly women dying from giving birth.
    Sometimes the police force fails to stop murders from happening, sometimes lifeguards
    fail to rescue people, sometimes safety cables snap.


    " Unless you prove it ethical I will not accept this as a counter."


    - This is not how society works, I do not have to prove that something is ethical,
    you have to prove to me why it isn''t. Every action by default is morally neutral,
    for example, swimming is not good nor bad so it is neutral. Therefore if something
    is neutral, someone would have to prove why swimming is unethical or bad, if not
    it is still neutral. I am not arguing that abortions in the scenarios I mentioned
    are particularly good acts, I am arguing that aborting a fetus if it isn''t sentient
    is a morally neutral act as it is neither good nor bad.


    " The reason most mothers experience mental issues after abortion is because they
    don''t perceive the entity in a dehumanizing manner. "


    - And that is the mothers own fault for not realizing that the fetus had no value,
    this has nothing to do with abortions. This is like blaming video games or tv
    to depression, it is not the tv nor video games fault, it is the person''s fault
    for becoming depressed over a video game or tv.


    " It''s also tied to regret, the rate of regret is close to 31% after an abortion,
    with 11% being prescribed psychotropic medications. "


    - This is society and the mother''s fault for valuing a non-sentient nor intelligent
    being. Again what about the negatives for giving birth or carrying a baby? Babys
    are not cheap and cost a great deal of money and time for the mother. Carrying
    the baby and giving birth also can cause many different mental and physical issues.
    For example, my boyfriend''s mother giving birth to 3 children directly caused
    depression for her and caused her to have weight issues. My mother grew several
    different food allergies from having me. These aren''t just random coincidences,
    it is backed up by science. According to **pregnancybirthbaby.org**, several different
    mental issues can arise from giving birth including depression, anxiety, and bipolar
    disorder. According to another article by **womenshealth.org**, pregnancy normally
    causes anemia, gestational diabetes, placental abruption, headaches, blurred vision,
    vaginal bleeding, and also depression. And once again after the birth we come
    into the issue of the baby taking a great deal of time and money to raise. Very
    plainly forcing a possible rape victim to go through such trauma''s after just
    being raped, is repulsive.


    " Right, but it''s dangerous to take such an incredibly marginal case and assume
    it bears any relevance to the majority. The vast majority of abortions that happen

    - Yes and before 5 months since the baby isn''t sentient nor intelligent, therefore
    the baby has no value and is just a cluster of cells. You still have not provided
    me with a trait that a fetus has that justifies its existence aside from it existing.
    But again just because it exists, doesn''t mean it should have moral value. Again
    if you want to use an appeal to existence, then you have to be against people
    killing ants and other non-sentient bugs, people killing micro bacteria, and men
    masturbating which in turn kills sperm.


    Case and point, you still have not provided acquit reasons as to why we should
    value a being which isn''t sentient nor intelligent in any way.

    The thing is, all of these things have value. The value is just significantly

    but if you step on a few then little observable harm was done.

    That IS quite the thing to ask of me. I know that it certainly isn''t sentience

    > "The murder rate is also statistically rare, so then should we just not have

    The primary difference here is that the police aren''t there as a safety net.
    They are a preventative measure like condoms. If the police were simply a safety
    net, they would love for people to break the law, probably even encourage it.


    Regardless, your analogy isn''t accurate. The rate of premature death is higher
    in the cases of abortion than it is in actual pregnancy. \[6\]


    > "Abortion only fails 2-3 % of the time. Compared to the high chances of women

    "


    See source \[6\]. Also, psychological trauma (which is real pain) is linked to
    abortion and miscarriage at a higher rate than birth, so this point simply doesn''t
    hold.


    > "This is not how society works, I do not have to prove that something is ethical,

    If you want to prove something should be legal, you have to prove many things.
    Namely, that there''s actually a reason for it to be legal. Every action can''t
    be morally neutral, it''s simply not possible. Every action carries implicit value
    and has consequence.


    > "that is the mothers own fault for not realizing that the fetus had no value,

    It''s the mother''s fault for valuing her child. This is incredibly wrong, from
    a biological standpoint and a moral one. By placing all your chips in sentience
    you''ve ironically removed humanity from the equation.


    > "This is society and the mother''s fault for valuing a non-sentient nor intelligent

    For example, my boyfriend''s mother giving birth to 3 children directly caused

    Society values the baby for many of reasons. The first and foremost is that we
    require them to be born for society to survive more than a single generation.
    The second is that they''re the embodiment of our ideals. The third is that life
    carries intrinsic value and purpose. The fourth is that babies are pure potential.


    From a sociological perspective alone abortions cost outweighs the benefit.

    This would be an appeal to potentiality which is not a very good basis to measure
    life on. If you think life is just simply based on potentiality, than again you
    have to be against men masturbating which destroys millions of sperm cells, and

    Since you are framing your entire argument on potentiality and existence, than
    again what makes a human different than a bug in your logic. In my logic, humans
    matter more as they are sentient and intelligent. However this doesn''t work in
    your logic, as this would mean they are equal since both humans and bugs exist.


    > If you were to massacre enough insects the ecosystem would collapse; likewise,
    if you kill enough babies society will collapse.


    Before I begin, I am NOT justifying the genocide of people or babies. Well ecosystems
    can directly impact humans, mostly in rural areas. For example if an entire population
    of ants dissipated from an area, the local bug pesticide company may go out of
    business. If the local foxes or deer become an endangered species, than the local
    hunters will be forced to find other animals to kill or may go out of business.
    The point is that ecosystems can impact human civilization.

    OK I''m sorry I think I asked the wrong question, what gives life it''s value
    than? Since you don''t care about sentient nor intelligence, and existence wouldn''t
    make you logical consistent and is very arbitrary, please explain to me the value
    that life has.

    First of all, cops whether as a safety net or preventive measure or not, don''t
    activily enjoy people breaking the law. Many have families and friends who would
    be devastated if the cop died. Secondly, preventive measure is not what cops are,
    they are a safety net. Preventive measures would be a measure you took to not
    get murdered or robbed. This could include locking doors, buying a security system,
    or maybe not walking down the dark scary alleyway. A safety net would be something
    that when the preventive measures fail and someone is in trouble, the safety net
    would essentially save that person. In this case, it would the the police force
    as at this point the preventive measures of home security and common sense have
    failed and due to this, the safety net/police force would save the person.

    Despite the fact that your source isn''t from a medical professional and looks
    to be from a bias source, it is a 100 % guarantee that raising a child costs a
    great deal of time and money to raise. We can debate the psychological issues
    a mother may obtain from pregnancy or abortion all we like, but the fact of the
    matter is that raising a child is not something every women or teenage girl can
    do.


    > If you want to prove something should be legal, you have to prove many

    > things. Namely, that there''s actually a reason for it to be legal.


    I have already provided several reasons as to why it should be legal, namely in
    the cases of the mother becoming pregnant outside of the mothers control IE broken
    condoms, rape ETC, and if the abortion is performed during the first 5 months
    when the fetus isn''t sentient nor intelligent. All acts by default are legal
    until proven to be illegal. For example, I don''t have to prove why walking around
    in sandals should be legal, you have to prove to me why it shouldn''t be illegal.
    Regardless I have already proven as to why abortion should be legal, you have
    still yet to give me good enough reasons to believe it should be illegal.


    > Every action can''t be morally neutral, it''s simply not possible.


    This is a straw-man argument, I NEVER said that all actions are morally neutral,
    I specifically states that all actions are morally neutral by DEFAULT.


    > It''s the mother''s fault for valuing her child. This is incredibly wrong, from
    a biological standpoint and a moral one.


    In the context of this scenario, the fetus is not alive yet as it is not sentient
    nor intelligent which is proven by biology and science. If the mother values a
    non-sentient nor intelligent being, this is not abortions fault this is the fault
    of society, and the mother. Besides if the mother doesn''t want to have an abortion,
    we aren''t going to force her to have one. If a rape victim wants to carry the
    fetus anyways and have the child, that is purely her choice. There are many women
    who would be happier without having the baby however.


    > From a sociological perspective alone abortions cost outweighs the benefit.


    Lets examine the costs, the costs of abortion are the mother possibly might experience
    trauma and depression. The benefits are most likely the mother does not have to
    go through physical pain of carrying the baby or giving birth, the mother saves
    a great deal of time and money from not raising the baby, and the assuming their
    are birth complications that may put the mother at risk the mother''s life would
    be saved.

    I don''t think such a complex topic is solvable within 5 written rounds, and given
    the option I would happily discuss this over a microphone.

    What do you think value itself is? Your intelligence argument is based upon the
    same potentiality as my own, the only difference is I''m applying it directly
    and consistently.


    > "Before I begin, I am NOT justifying the genocide of people or babies. Well

    By definition that''s exactly what large-scale abortion is. I also never claimed
    ecosystems couldn''t impact humans. The potential of an ant, or that of a microbe
    is incredibly less than that of a human baby.


    > "OK I''m sorry I think I asked the wrong question, what gives life it''s value

    The question of value is a question of potential and purpose. You seemed to have
    confined potential to intelligence and sentience while completely avoiding the
    more important question.


    > "First of all, cops whether as a safety net or preventive measure or not, don''t
    activily enjoy people breaking the law."


    I agree, and I never said they did enjoy such a thing. I said in the hypothetical
    circumstance they were a safety net they would allow crimes to happen, the objective
    wouldn''t be to stop someone from committing a crime.


    > "Despite the fact that your source isn''t from a medical professional and looks

    Except it''s a systematic review published by a certified gynecologist and a man
    with a PhD in bioethics.


    > "Regardless I have already proven as to why abortion should be legal, you have
    still yet to give me good enough reasons to believe it should be illegal. "


    I have provided many reasons for it to be illegal. A few examples of my ''reasons'':
    harm to the mother, harm to the baby, harm to our future, etc.


    > "In the context of this scenario, the fetus is not alive yet as it is not sentient

    Actually the fetus is alive and constitutes life, just not necessarily ''sentient''
    life as you''ve put it. Women are biologically preconditioned to ascribe emotional
    value to the child -- logically justified or not, that is the case.


    > "Lets examine the costs, the costs of abortion are the mother possibly might

    The great thing here is that these are not sociological arguments. I''d love for
    anyone name me a single valid sociological benefit to abortion.


    > "This is a straw-man argument, I NEVER said that all actions are morally neutral,
    I specifically states that all actions are morally neutral by DEFAULT. "


    I said in no uncertain terms that it is impossible for an action to be morally
    neutral. That was my point, and if there ever was a clear case of projection this
    would be it.


    In response to your assertion of strawmanning: I have done no such thing throughout
    this entire debate. However, if I pointed the finger back at you I don''t think
    you dispute misrepresenting many of my own arguments. After this last round, I''m
    entirely convinced you didn''t argue in good faith.

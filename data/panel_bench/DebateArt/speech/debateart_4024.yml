    \nEconomic inequality is inevitable, and is evidently immensly improved by the\
    \ invisible hand. The difference is between a single man or body (the government)\
    \ controlling all the wealth of a nation, or every having their own share which\
    \ is distributed through exchange.\n\nMarx promised that classes would be leveled\
    \ and universal equality would reign. In the USSR, it an inherently unfair system\
    \ and exacerbated its problems. Joseph Stalin had wealth worth today upwards of\
    \ seven trillion dollars to use to his liking.\n\nCapitalism never promised a\
    \ perfect society, nor preach its own perfection, yet it has, is, and will always\
    \ be the most perfect economic system. Capitalism has always been at the forefront\
    \ of making society better and the world safer.\n\nThe ideas of capitalism's father\
    \ were raised in response to mercantilism and protectionism hindering free trade\
    \ (remember, communism came after). Free and fair trade between nations has always\
    \ been at the heart of capitalism. Tariffs and other forms of protectionism make\
    \ a nation suffer. We have a global economy and the nations that contribute to\
    \ it get even larger rewards.\n\n> Trade is central to ending global poverty.\
    \ Countries that are open to international trade tend to grow faster, innovate,\
    \ improve productivity and provide higher income and more opportunities to their\
    \ people. Open trade also benefits lower-income households by offering consumers\
    \ more affordable goods and services. -\u201CStronger Open Trade Policies Enable\

    \ there are problems with any solution, and issues arise through the cracks. Saying\
    \ cookie dough or drying of a water source by a company is proof that capitalism\
    \ does not advance society is dubious.\n\nTo prove the point, here is some proof.\
    \ While the contender argues that Nestl\xE9 using a water source up, capitalism\
    \ has produced unrivaled innovation. This innovation includes desalination which\
    \ has made the desert green and quench people's thirst.\n\nAnother point is that\
    \ there are more than one type of capitalism, and some forms of it have the capability\
    \ of fixing the concerns given by the contender.<https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/Series/Back-to-Basics/Capitalism>\n\
    \nOur choices do not have to be one extreme or another, and frankly, they shouldn't.\n\

    \ diseases, to quench thirst, to feed the hungry. Through these advancements,\
    \ all of these become cheaper.<https://idexinnovation.com/blog/the-importance-of-innovation/#:~:text=Scientific%20and%20technological%20progress%20brought,and%20transformation%20in%20our%20societies>.\n\
    \nAs said earlier, there are different forms of capitalism, and regulation by\
    \ the government is still able to fit into the framework. The government can push\
    \ forward the economy and market and the invisible hand will let it fly.\n\nThe\
    \ same economy which you pointed out had people unemployed, employs them. The\
    \ same economy which can be unequal can become equal, the Kuznets Curve.<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simon-kuznets.asp>\n\
    \nAs the world became more industrialized, it became more unequal, but there are\
    \ two sides to every coin and the curve proves it. Industrialization and innovation\
    \ opens the door for better healthcare, safer food and water, and overall, higher\
    \ standards of living.\n\nThe best way to demonstrate how much capitalism has\
    \ advanced society, is to look how a society can go backward.\n\nIn Venezuela,\
    \ the former richest country in South America, is now the poorest since embracing\
    \ socialism. The people are now eating rats, drinking dirty water, or not drinking\
    \ at all, and living in filth. While their leaders eat up resources and lives\
    \ a luxurious lifestyle.\n\nIn China, the communist government took away the choice\
    \ of its people to choose their employment, during the failed Great Leap Forward\
    \ Program, resulting in the deaths of tens of millions. China under Deng Xiaoping\
    \ became a modern country generating wealth and started to advance, which is now\
    \ going backward under the leadership of Xi Jingping.\n\nCapitalism was a liberal\
    \ idea to give power to the people, to take control of their lives. Once countries\
    \ became modern, they became more equal politically and economically, making it\
    \ possible for a nobody to become rich and powerful.\n\nBy virtue, a freer society\
    \ is a progressive one. A capitalist society which decentralizes the power of\
    \ a hungry government is a progressive one. Innovation has made the world better,\
    \ and that cannot be denied. The extent to which capitalism has made the world\
    \ society more advanced is up for debate, but the overlying fact is that it has.\n\
    \nMaybe I am crazy, but in my book a society is more advanced when it is freer\
    \ and the government leaves the people alone. When people can choose their place\
    \ of employment and how they spend their money. A society is more advanced when\
    \ it makes it possible to drag people out of poverty. It is more advanced when\
    \ it makes food cheaper. It is more advanced when it can make water drinkable.\
    \ It is undeniably more advanced when it can feed, clothe, and provide quality\
    \ services for less, and the government does not spoil the good brought about\

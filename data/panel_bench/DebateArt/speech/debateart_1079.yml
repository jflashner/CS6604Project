  content: "## Since the debate resolution clarifies that bestiality should be not\
    \ be illegal in all cases, Pro wins by providing at least one case in which bestiality\
    \ should not be illegal.\n\n**Contention\n1 \u2013 Argument from consent** If\
    \ the sole reason why bestiality should be illegal is a lack of\nconsent, then\
    \ bestiality should be legal in all instances in which an animal\ncan consent.\n\
    \nResearch into great ape language has revealed that certain species such\nas\
    \ gorillas can acquire sign language and use this to both request actions and\n\
    answer questions [\\[1\\]](https://www.koko.org/sites/default/files/root/pdfs/1997_Advances_in_Psychology.pdf).\
    \ The female gorilla \u2018Koko\u2019 for instance requested babies\nusing sign\
    \ language and was later given kittens as compensation \\[2\\], hence surely\n\
    if an animal can explicitly communicate using language to this degree of\ncomplexity,\
    \ this could be used to request intercourse or give consent by\naccepting intercourse.\
    \ Therefore, in at least some cases bestiality should be\nlegal as animal can\
    \ consent. Furthermore, unless a male dog mounts a human\nfemale, it would be\
    \ very difficult for engage in intercourse with a dog since\nthese only engage\
    \ in \u2018doggy style\u2019 intercourse without the opportunity of woman\non\
    \ top. Hence, while animals such as dogs could not explicitly communicate\nconsent\
    \ using language, initiating the sex themselves implies consent, and\nhence provides\
    \ a further, more general, example of animal\u2019s ability to consent\nto sexual\
    \ intercourse with humans. A 2006 Danish Animal Ethics Council report further\n\
    outlined that a) animals can give consent both through initiation of\nintercourse,\
    \ as well as lack of protest (any pet owner will know that if their\npet is not\
    \ in the mood to be touched, it will simply walk away or possibly even\ngrowl\
    \ and attack), b) bestiality can provide a pleasurable experience for both the\
    \ human\nas well as the animal, which is further supported by the existence of\
    \ homosexual\nrelationships in most mammal species [\\[3\\]](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tmFJ1LhbVWcC&lpg=PP1&pg=PT20&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false)\
    \ that show that reproduction is not the\nsole role of sexual intercourse, and\
    \ c) some non-human animals, among them\ndogs, show sexually attraction toward\
    \ humans [\\[4\\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20111009031312/http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/fileadmin/downloads/Dyrevaernsraad/Seksuel%20omgang%20med%20dyr.pdf).\n\
    \nIn conclusion, great apes that possess language abilities provide the\nclearest\
    \ example of animals being able to give consent, however, male dogs\nmounting\
    \ female humans are also a clear example of consent, while intercourse\nbetween\
    \ male men and animals can still involve implied consent due to lack of\nprotest\
    \ by the animals.\n\n**Contention\n2 \u2013 Lack of necessity**A law without a\
    \ purpose would be futile, if beyond an appeal to\nconsistency, the only other\
    \ appeal is to possible harm to the animal, then a\nlaw against bestiality would\
    \ be futile and should hence not exist. Denmark\u2019s\nAnimal Ethics Council\
    \ opposed the introduction of an anti-bestiality law in Denmark\nin 2015 as \u201C\
    existing laws which allow bestiality except in cases where the\nanimal can be\
    \ proved to have suffered were enough\u201D [\\[4\\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/denmark-outlaws-bestiality-in-narrow-vote/).\
    \ Similarly, in the United\nStates, the Animal Welfare Act 2006 already establishes\
    \ that \u201CA person commits\nan offence if an act of his, or a failure of his\
    \ to act, causes an animal to\nsuffer\u201D [\\[5\\]](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/45/section/4),\
    \ hence explicitly criminalising bestiality would be futile as harm\nto the animal\
    \ is already illegal. Therefore, bestiality should not be illegal as\nthere are\
    \ already laws in place that prevent harm to the animals.\\\nFurthermore, based\
    \ on John Stuart Mill\u2019s harm principle: \u201CThat the only\npurpose for\
    \ which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a\ncivilized community,\
    \ against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own\ngood, either physical\
    \ or moral, is not a sufficient warrant.\u201D [\\[6\\]](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/335611-the-object-of-this-essay-is-to-assert-one-very)\
    \ Peter Singer\nhas argued that bestiality is not unethical as long as it does\
    \ not involve harm\nto the animal, and that the stigma associated with it is merely\
    \ due to\nirrational speciesism [\\[7\\]](https://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/2001----.htm).\
    \ In 1957, the Wolfenden Report cited the harm-principle as\none of the primary\
    \ arguments for legalising homosexual acts in the United\nKingdom, which led to\
    \ the 1967 Sexual Offences Acts in which homosexual acts\nhave been legalised.\
    \ Similarly, bestiality should be legalised as long as no\nharm comes to any external\
    \ party and hence bestiality should not be illegal in\nall cases.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\
    \nIn conclusion, neither an appeal to consent, nor an appeal to harm can justify\
    \ the illegality of bestiality. An appeal to consent fails due to the explicit\
    \ consent by great apes, implicit consent through intercourse initiation by animals\
    \ and implicit consent through lack of protest by animals, which generally protest\
    \ when uncomfortable such as dogs. An appeal to harm, on the other hand, fails\
    \ due to harm to animals already being illegal and a bestiality law hence being\
    \ futile, and possible discomfort to external parties not justifying the law as\
    \ this would also affect homosexual acts.\n"

  content: "Your arguments basically approach this from the animal side-- can the\
    \ animal provide consent, is there harm to the animal, etc. Of the two parties\
    \ involved, the animal and the human, primary importance should be given to the\

    \ Nonetheless, even if it were proven to be true, just because we see behavior\
    \ exhibited in animals doesn't necessarily mean that same behavior should be accepted\
    \ in the human species. Animals defecate on streets and sidewalks. The City of\

    \ acceptable with humans. So\n\nContention 1 - the Koko and dog examples are fine\
    \ and dandy, but just because an animal is able to use certain gestures, you can\
    \ not be 100% sure that this is \"consent\", i.e. a voluntary response on the\
    \ part of the animal to agree to the proposal or desire of the other.. The animal\
    \ could still be operating out of \"instinct\", which is not voluntary.\n\n1.\
    \ Koko requesting Babies. I would not consider that an example of consent. My\
    \ dog has been trained to ring a bell on the door when he wants to go outside.\
    \ He nudge his nose at the bell when he wants to go outside because he equates\
    \ the sound of a bell with going outside and chasing squirrels. Thus, whenever\
    \ he hears another bell he rushes to the door. His behavior is more out of conditioning.\
    \ Is Koko's behavior similar?\n2. a) When the animal is \"communicating\" this\
    \ way, is it responding to what's it been conditioned to or is it truly exhibiting\
    \ a voluntary desire (i.e. not condition or instinct). I've seen dogs initiate\
    \ intercourse with an embarrassed person's leg-- is that dog initiating consent\
    \ (voluntary) or is it just responding by instinct to conditions within it's body\
    \ and knows no other way but to hump what's alive nearby?\\\n   b) You are assuming\
    \ it's \"pleasurable\" for the animal\n3. c) THis is a very important. EVERY action\
    \ has an objective, and some may have primary and secondary objectives. What are\
    \ the objectives of Sexual Intercourse? Primary Objective is the propagation of\
    \ the species. Secondary objective is the unification and pleasure of the members.\
    \ When both the Primary and Secondary objectives are present, sexual intercourse\
    \ is a selfless act-- when you open the sexual act to bringing a new member of\
    \ the species, it is a self-less act. When you engage in sexual activity strictly\
    \ for self-pleasure, it turns it into a selfish act. The habitual engagement in\
    \ selfish acts, no matter what they are, is not good for a human society, a society\
    \ in which members must work together for the betterment of each other and the\
    \ society at large. Habitual selfishness is not healthy.\n4. So? Just because\
    \ an animal wants to do something with a human is not good enough reason for that\
    \ act to be \"legal\". Some dogs want to maul humans-- should that be legal too?\n\
    \nContention 2 - the only possible appeal is harm to the animal? Um, no. Sorry.\
    \ You are making a huge assumption that having intercourse with a beast (animal)\
    \ is healthy and would do no harm to the person. I would argue it's unhealthy,\
    \ much like having sex with a tennis racket, a coke can, a machete, or any in\
    \ other non-human object is unhealthy. Bestiality promotes/fosters \"selfishness\
    \ within the individual\". Selfish is not healthy. Bestiality sets a bad example\
    \ for other members of the Human Society (this is the \"harm to others\" part).\
    \ Then there is just the flat-out physical harm that can occur with such acts.\n\
    \nThe problem with Singer et al is that they fail to see the harm to others (Setting\
    \ bad example, etc). To take Mill (and Singer's) philosophy a step further, one\
    \ has to answer the questions, does the ACT (any act) impose harm to others, not\
    \ just physical harm? I would argue, why is this speciesism \"irrational\", as\

  content: 'Bestiality is not natural to humans. It''s not., Sorry. I challenge you
    to argue that it is.


    That''s the primary reason for making it and keeping it illegal.


    Before you continue with your Bagehimian Rhapsody (See what I did there?), suffice
    it to say that although homosexual behavior is very common in the animal world,
    it seems to be very uncommon that individual animals have a long-lasting predisposition
    to engage in such behavior to the exclusion of heterosexual activities. Thus,
    a homosexual orientation, if one can speak of such thing in animals, seems to
    be a rarity. So called homosexual relationships in other animals does not prove
    sexual intercourse has another purpose. It, at best, highlights the fact that
    animals operate out of instinct and urges and do not have the capability to keep
    those urges in check.


    You argue that my claims can be carried to absurdity. Likewise the claim or argument
    that bestiality should be legal can also be carried to absurdity.


    But alas, suffice it to say this. Bestiality is not normal and does harm to the
    human person.


    1. You have not proven that animals can, and do, provide consent. You''ve only
    taken observed behaviors and extrapolated those to mean they imply consent. And
    you have not ruled out acting on instinct.

    2. Your Livescience.com claim does indeed imply that animals find pleasure in
    sex, but again, you are assuming they would find pleasure in having sex with humans.
    3) There is a specific purpose to sex: the propagation of the species. That is
    the primary purpose.

    3. Your claim "The law ought not to be concerned with acts that involve no harm
    to anyone other than the parties that are willingly involved, Mill wrote that
    every person is the best judge of what will make them happy, who are we to force
    our view of what will make them happy on them in the absence of harm to others?".
    No, sorry. Not buying it . Often times people are incapable of doing what is right,
    even if they KNOW they should. Addicts harm themselves because are simply unable
    to stop. Yes, it makes them happy . Should the law then be changed just because
    addicts "think they are happy?" Nope.

    4. a human having sex with a non-human is not healthy. Replacing a healthy sexual
    encounter with a non-healthy sexual encounter sets a bad example to others.

    s argument is a\nnon-sequitur, it simply does not follow that bestiality should\
    \ be illegal\nsimply because it is unnatural. Processed food is unnatural, surely\
    \ that does\nnot imply it should be illegal, engaging with technology is unnatural,\
    \ however\nCon seems to have no issue with using modern technology. An act being\
    \ unnatural\ndoes not imply it is bad or should be illegal.\n\nb) Inter-species\
    \ sex has been found to be natural in many\nspecies such as monkeys and deer [\\\
    [1\\]](https://medium.com/@kimaniakerr/if-bestiality-isnt-normal-it-might-be-natural-571b780e19ef),\
    \ in fact, over 90 species have been identified\nby a 2008 literature review that\
    \ did engage or attempted to engage in inter-species\nsex [\\[2\\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20150223183054/https://www.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/fb6/prof/BIO/Groening___Hochkirch_2008.pdf).\
    \ My opponent claims that it is \u201Cnot natural to humans\u201D, without backing\n\
    this assertion up with any evidence. As many other mammal species that are\nclosely\
    \ related to humans engage in inter-species sex, there seems to be no reason\n\
    to assume that humans are the exception. In fact, there are depictions of bestiality\n\
    from the palaeolithic period [\\[3\\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20120726163724/http://www.actasurologicas.info/v30/n03/ENG/3003OR02.htm)\
    \ suggesting that bestiality is not a new\nphenomenon, followed by many further\
    \ depictions during the Neolithic era [\\[4\\]](https://web.archive.org/web/20100819050756/http://www.ssfpa.se/pdf/2008/anati_adorant08.pdf).\
    \ Con has\nprovided no evidence that bestiality is unnatural and in light of the\
    \ common\ninter-species sex in other species and the long history of bestiality\
    \ in\nhumans, there seems to be no basis for assuming that it is.\n\nc) Even\n\
    if a) were overcome, and there was some legitimate reason why an act being\nunnatural\
    \ implies that it should be illegal and b) were overcome to show that bestiality\n\
    is indeed unnatural, this would not be a feasible or desirable criterion of illegality.\n\
    Between 3.5% (females) and 8% (males) have reported having engaged in bestiality\n\
    at least once, \u201CAmong men living in rural areas, the figure shot up to 50\n\
    percent.\u201D [\\[5\\]](http://web.archive.org/web/20080316030814/http://www.nerve.com/Opinions/Singer/heavyPetting/main.asp)\
    \ it would not be feasible to lock up between 3.5% and 8% of the\npopulation.\
    \ Additionally, my opponent seems to believe that homosexual\nintercourse in humans\
    \ is unnatural (inferred from his claims that \u201Cthe jury is\nstill out\u201D\
    \ in R2), which would doom a further 4.5%\nof Americans to criminal penalties\
    \ [\\[6\\]](https://news.gallup.com/poll/234863/estimate-lgbt-population-rises.aspx).\
    \ Hence, due to the sheer number of \u2018unnatural\u2019\nactivities of humans\
    \ in contemporary societies, it is neither a feasible nor an\nadequate standard\
    \ of determining illegality.\n\nTo conclude, my opponent's case is based on bestiality\
    \ being unnatural. I have shown in a) that it does not follow that an act being\
    \ unnatural implies it should be illegal citing examples such as modern technology.\
    \ In b) I have shown that even if a) were false, bestiality is more likely to\
    \ be natural, rather than unnatural, in humans due to many other mammals similarly\
    \ engaging in inter-species sex and the long history of bestiality in humans,\
    \ and hence would not be affected by Con's criterion of legality. Finally, I have\
    \ shown that even if both a) and b) were false, it would be unfeasible to implement\
    \ Con's criterion of illegality both due to the commonness of bestiality itself\
    \ and that of other unnatural behaviours such as the consumption of processed\
    \ foods, rather than traditional palaeolithic foods. Hence, **Con's case is neither\
    \ sound (a), nor would it apply to bestiality (b), nor could it be implemented\
    \ if it did apply to bestiality (c)**, hence his case falls to pieces and Con\
    \ has outlined no further reason, other than it being 'selfish due to seeking\
    \ pleasure' which has been addressed in my Round 2, why bestiality should be illegal\
    \ and will not be able to do so in his final round as I would not be able to address\
    \ this, hence Con failed to show that bestiality should be illegal in all cases.\n\
    \n**Short defence of Round 2:**\\\nMy opponent puts forward the primary\ncontention\
    \ that animals gain no pleasure from bestiality.\\\nFirstly he asserts that homosexual\
    \ animal relationships are merely superficial without backing this up with any\
    \ evidence. This assertion is contradicted by ecological studies, 25% of black\
    \ swans, for instance, are primarily homosexual and perform parenting duties together\
    \ and also perform pre-marital rituals and greeting ceremonies, suggesting that\
    \ it is not just 'urges' as Con claims. Con concedes that animals gain pleasure\
    \ through sexual intercourse as well, but presumes that this would be different\
    \ during bestiality, however, I have cited an article in R1 that shows that \"\
    bestiality can provide a pleasurable experience for both\", contradicting his\
    \ presumption that he did not back up with any evidence. Con's 4) and 5) have\

    to activity occurring in the animal kingdom is not justification for that same
    activity in the human world.


    c) - Whether or not a society can handle the incarceration of criminals should
    not be a reason for whether or not an act should be legal or illegal. An act should
    be legal or illegal based on the act''s impact to the individual and/or society,
    not based on whether or not the society can handle the consequences of it being
    illegal or not.


    d) One report or study is not confirmation that animals derive pleasure from sex
    with humans. Furthermore, do not confuse "physical response" with pleasure. A
    person masturbating a horse might cause the horse to ejaculate. Just because this
    physical response occurs, doesn''t necessarily equate to "pleasure". Who knows,
    maybe the horse feels regret and remorse after such an encounter? Of course, this
    all PRESUMES that animals have "feelings" as humans do.


    Finally, I can challenge the claim that animals do not derive pleasure without
    providing evidence. It''s not necessary for me to. You made the claim they do,
    and I challenged your arguments for that. Implying that I did not back up with
    evidence my presumption of no pleasure is irrelevant. That''s akin to saying "You
    need to provide evidence they don''t derive pleasure". No. NO I don''t. You made
    the claim they do, and I challenged that claim and your arguments.

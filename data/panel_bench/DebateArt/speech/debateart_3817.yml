  content: "**Argument one: CON bears the burden of proof.**\n\n_Note the resolution\
    \ says \"not good\" **\u2260** \"bad\"._\n\nPhilosophers such as Plato have crowned\
    \ a term named _\"chaotic state\"_ which denotes that, in the status quo world\
    \ prior to intelligibility, nothing was prohibited eg. the status quo of \"killing\"\
    \ prior to philosophy could only be described amorally (not good, not bad) because\
    \ it lacked any property. In philosophy we should always work ground up and take\
    \ no assumptions. Thus, if we look at Barney's (B from now on) record neutrally,\
    \ we should _assume_ that it lacks properties of good or bad, and work from a\
    \ place of neutrality to determine whether it is either of those things. Thus,\
    \ the status quo is that B is neither good nor bad (hence not good).\n\nIf B wishes\
    \ to attack their current \"not good\" status, they must provide proof. Otherwise,\
    \ they take L.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\
    \n**Argument two:** **B** **does not have the traits of a good debater.**\n\n\
    Characteristics =\n\n01. **Beaten good opponents.**\n\n02. **Good analysis abilities.**\n\
    \n03. How we determine this? Two ways\n\n04. Look at all their opponents holistically\
    \ - what is their combined record?\n\n05. Combined records is a good way to determine\
    \ strength. Eg. if my record is 100-0 but all my opponents have lost 10 times\
    \ this isn't impressive. However, if my record is 10-3 and all my opponents have\
    \ won 100 times, this is indicate of a better debater. It isn't perfect, but the\
    \ probabilities of noob sniping is much less in the bare record (more difficult\
    \ to find 10 bad opponents who've won 100 times than to snipe 100 people).\n\n\
    06. For reference two debaters we consider good\n\n07. Whiteflames\n\n08. 1171-1704\
    \ (excluding oromagi because he is an anomaly)\n\n09. Bones\n\n10. 238-159\n\n\
    11. Notable people they have beaten\n\n12. Whiteflames\n\n13. Oromagi\n\n14. bmdrocks21\n\
    \n15. blamonkey\n\n16. RationalMadMan\n\n17. Ehyeh\n\n18. Undefeatable\n\n19.\
    \ Intelligence\n\n20. MrChris\n\n21. Tejretics\n\n22. very respectable - these\
    \ guys all have positive ratios themselves, and Tejretics was a DDO goat.\n\n\
    23. Bones\n\n24. Whiteflames\n\n25. Fauxlaw\n\n26. Benjamin\n\n27. Nyxified\n\n\
    28. Sum1hugme\n\n29. Respectable, considering the small numbers of debates done\
    \ - Nyxified was herself a state champion debater.\n\nLet's run these metrics\
    \ on Barney\n\n- Combined record\n\n* 390-**_1104_**\n\n- FUN FACT - Barney has,\
    \ out of his 37 opponents beaten on 3 people with a **positive win loss ratio**\n\
    \n* Strong opponents\n\n- Novice (who he calls bad at debating) and who he is\
    \ currently running from.\n- shas04 who is 0-2, 17 years old and who barney said\
    \ [\"Were this debate to happen today, I am quite certain **I would lose; and\
    \ justly so\"**](https://www.debateart.com/debates/577-perpetrators-of-minor-crimes-should-not-be-arrested?open_tab=comments&comments_page=1&comment_number=25)\n\
    \n* Literally no one else. I couldn't find a single person who hadn't lost three\
    \ times more than they had won.\n\n**It is clear that Barney's record is embarrassing.\
    \ He is in no way a good debater. He has not beaten anyone good, not do his opponents\
    \ have good records. His lack of interaction with good debaters makes it impossible\
    \ for him to be good.**\n\nRemember the second dot point which is giving a good\
    \ analysis. I can't prove he doesn't give good analysis (just like how he can't\
    \ prove their isn't a magic grain of sand somewhere on the beach) but he can try\
    \ to prove otherwise.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\
    \n**Argument three: No one on this site is a good debater**\n\nBit of a cheeky\
    \ argument here. Debater is defined like this - [a person who argues about a subject,\
    \ especially in a formal manner](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=debater+meaning&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).\n\
    \nThat is, a debater is someone conforms to the above definition.\\\nLet's think\
    \ of **every** debater in the world on a spectrum\\\nBad debater - - - - - good\
    \ debater.\n\nTo be a good debater out of the wide pool of debaters that exist,\
    \ you must have some great debating skills and corresponding prizes (participated\
    \ in national debating, participated in Ivy League debates, participated in high\
    \ level debates e.g. Harris vs Peterson, or debated in high level debating contests).\
    \ B must prove that he did this, again, from my chaotic state observation, the\
    \ status quo is that he has **not** done any of these things (we should assume\
    \ he hasn't) so to disprove this point he must prove that he has done some good\
    \ debates. If he hasn't then he isn't a good debater, in the sense that in society,\
    \ he is not a good debater.\n"

  content: "**Preamble:**\\\nI shall prove my case on three fronts, which shall be\
    \ given their own sections below\n\n1. Win Record\n2. Leaderboard\n3. Quality\
    \ of Debates\n\nScope\\\nThis debate is limited to DebateArt.com, as written in\
    \ the description: \u201Cwe only consider debateart because debate.org is gone\
    \ and we don't know about it\u201D\\[sic\\]. Therefore, I shall seek to prove\
    \ myself good by the standards of this website.\n\nBurden of Proof\\\nI have no\
    \ issue with baring primary BoP.\n\nGiven the many definitions for good, I shall\
    \ assume via context that it is a reference of degree of skill and quality to\
    \ a notably above average at debating within the confines of this website.\n\n\
    **1. Win Record**\\\nMy win record speaks for itself. 37 to 0. On average, the\
    \ top 30 debaters only win 81.67% of the time.\\\nMeaning were I average among\
    \ them (each already self-evidently good), I would have lost 7 of those debates.\n\
    \n**2. Leaderboard**\\\nThe leaderboard uses an Elo calculation to rate debaters\
    \ against each other via comparative and weighted wins and losses ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system)).\n\
    \nI\u2019m 4th place out of 636 debaters (there are 2,839 total site members)\
    \ ([2](https://www.debateart.com/leaderboard/debates)).\\\nFrom within that population,\
    \ were I average I\u2019d be around 318th place. I am clearly several orders of\
    \ magnitude above average.\\\nDue to frequency of someone showing up and full\
    \ forfeiting their first debate, let\u2019s decrease the size of that population...\\\
    \nWe can deduct the ~240 who had a single loss, and average would be 198th place.\\\
    \nWe can further deduct the ~90 who had two losses, and the average would be 153rd\
    \ place. Among that distilled population, I would still rank 4th (which is to\
    \ say in the top 97th percentile).\n\n**3. Quality of Debates**\\\nI offer readers\
    \ high quality debates worth reading, which is self-evidentially a good.\n\nObvious\
    \ examples include:\n\n- The Hall of Fame winning _Fetuses as a replacement for\
    \ the USD_ ([3](https://info.debateart.com/hall-of-fame#debates), [4](https://www.debateart.com/debates/866-fetuses-as-a-replacement-for-the-usd)).My\
    \ opponent for that demonstrated himself to be quite good in his months before\
    \ facing me, with several victories and a fine showing against Pinkfreud08; for\
    \ which my arguments were able to turn a pro-life voter ([5](https://www.debateart.com/debates/654-legalizing-abortion-in-the-us)).\n\
    - I successfully navigate trap debates, such as _Brandon Stark will be the one\
    \ who leads Westeros at the end of episode 6_ ([6](https://www.debateart.com/debates/931-brandon-stark-will-be-the-one-who-leads-westeros-at-the-end-of-episode-6))(and\
    \ yes, sourcing pun intended).\n- I even win arguing uphill against truisms, as\
    \ seen with _The Bible teaches that Jesus Christ is God_ ([7](https://www.debateart.com/debates/950-the-bible-teaches-that-jesus-christ-is-god)).\n\
    - And let us not forget it was one of my debates which spawned the meme worthy\
    \ \u201CMr. Hitler\u201D quote ([8](https://www.debateart.com/debates/2397-present-proof-that-adolf-hitler-was-a-racist)).\
    \ And including Like a Boss as a serious line of contention (9, [10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NisCkxU544c))\n\
    \n**4. Rebuttals:**\\\n4.1. \u201CBeaten good opponents.\u201D\\\nMost obviously\
    \ pro offers only a single subjective metric against me; which the positive metrics\
    \ significantly outweigh.\n\nThat Whiteflame and Bones exist and are top tier\
    \ debaters, does not challenge if anyone else is good. In fact the best debaters\
    \ (such as Oromagi, whom pro is in turn mimicking) are upfront about using my\
    \ debating style guide as their baseline ([11](http://tiny.cc/DebateArt)).\n\n\
    Further, Pro cites my opponents more recent records, rather than what they were\
    \ at the time of the challenges. My [4](https://www.debateart.com/debates/866-fetuses-as-a-replacement-for-the-usd)th\
    \ source as an example, may be followed to find my opponent\u2019s track record\
    \ after the debate as throwing in the towel. Additionally, many of their losses\
    \ following our debates were the results of forfeitures; thus, not an indicator\
    \ to their skill at the time of any challenge to which they did not abandon.\n\
    \n4.2. \u201CGood analysis abilities.\u201D\\\nThis was left hanging without any\
    \ support. The fact is I am great as analysis, as is clearly evidenced above;\
    \ with my math challenge against RationalMadman (for which another debater stood\
    \ in; but it still shows both superior analysis and that I\u2019m no coward) ([12](https://www.debateart.com/debates/803-default-auto-loss-on-forfeit));\
    \ and with writing the best Kritik guide available to elevate debating quality\
    \ ([13](https://tiny.cc/Kritik)).\n\n4.3. \u201CNo one on this site is a good\
    \ debater\u201D\\\nOutside the scope of this debate, as the scope is clearly stated\
    \ to be centric to this site via the description.\n\nWithin the scope of this\
    \ debate, I\u2019m in the Hall of Fame for a few categories ([3](https://info.debateart.com/hall-of-fame#debates)).\n\
    \nWere the scope not so narrow...\\\nTo debate is an exercise in persuasion, and\
    \ my persuasion skills have easily saved dozens of lives via educating sick villagers\
    \ in Iraq how to clean their drinking water (and yes, they needed persuasion);\
    \ saving many of their children from the 2nd leading cause of death among children\
    \ worldwide ([14](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/causes-of-death-in-children?time=2008),\
    \ [15](https://www.debateart.com/forum/topics/2745-ragnar-first-gold-ama?page=1&post_number=4)).\
    \ This beats any trophy won in pure safety.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n01. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system>\n\

  content: "**Rebuttals**\n\n- I'll start of with CON's case, which will morph into\
    \ my own. Just some thought before I dive in, the first two arguments are premised\
    \ on the very mechanism I critiqued - that utterly manipulatable elo system which\
    \ allows for noob sniping.\n\n**Clarification: Debater vs Debater**\n\nB quite\
    \ cheekily states the following: _I shall assume via context that it is a reference\
    \ of degree of skill and quality to a notably above average at debating within\
    \ the confines of this website_. I will refer you to the definition proposed in\
    \ the first round, which says a debater is \"[a person who argues about a subject,\
    \ especially in a formal manner](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=debater+meaning&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)\"\
    . B is trying to make it so that to be considered \"good\", they must be good\
    \ only within this site. This is not the case. Imagine if I created a public speaking\
    \ community with three people and I am the best. Sure, I would be the best _within\
    \ the site_ but would I be \"a good speaker\"? Clearly not, because the criterias\
    \ for being a good speaker/debater is outside of what medium they use, it is whether\
    \ they are good at \"arguing about a subject, especially in a formal manner\"\
    . B may wish to say the description says \"we only consider debateart\", but this\
    \ clearly does not mean we should redefine \"debater\". Using my speaker example\
    \ again, if I were to open a speaking comp and question whether someone else was\
    \ good, whilst putting into description \"we only consider this site\", it clearly\
    \ indicates that we can only use what we know of the person from the site (hence\
    \ consider this site), but that we are still considering their speaking ability\
    \ with the common definition as opposed to some weirdo skewed one which only considers\
    \ those within the site.\n\n**1. Win Record & 2. Leaderboard**\n\n- B's point\
    \ in his **Win Record Argument** is this.\n\n* p1. I have long win record compared\
    \ to everyone else.\n* C1. Therefore I am good debater.\n\n- B's point in his\
    \ **Leaderboard** argument is this.\n\n* p1. I have a high elo compared to everyone\
    \ else.\n* C1. Therefore I am a good debater.\n\n- The argument here is **assumes**\
    \ that a win record and high elo is indicative of a good debater. **This is not\
    \ the case.** I clearly provided a criteria for a good debater (beaten good opponents\
    \ and have good analysis) and farming wins does not satisfy any of these criteria.\n\
    \n* Though it may seem odd, **winning debates here does not necessarily mean you\
    \ are a good debater**. Consider for example, as I said in my first round, someone\
    \ who snipes 100 debates. By B's logic, this person would be good at debating.\
    \ This makes no sense, does someone who picks on people who they know will forfeit\
    \ debates show they are [a person who argues about a subject, especially in a\
    \ formal manner](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=debater+meaning&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)\
    \ to a degree which will make them good? Obviously not. I proposed a far better\
    \ metric (looking at the combined record of past competitors) to which I get zip\
    \ nada response from B.\n\n**3. Quality debates**\n\nExamples B gives are bad\n\
    \n- [1.](https://www.debateart.com/debates/866-fetuses-as-a-replacement-for-the-usd)\
    \ B himself said it was a [\"satirical debate on fetuses\"](https://www.debateart.com/forum/topics/2858-hall-of-fame-i-nominations?page=11&post_number=263)\
    \ (comedic \u2260 good debater\\_**)**\\_ which got only three votes at the end.\n\
    - [2.](https://www.debateart.com/debates/931-brandon-stark-will-be-the-one-who-leads-westeros-at-the-end-of-episode-6)\
    \ Awful - PRO's entire first round was two sentences, unstructured, unsourced,\
    \ clearly suggestive of a not good debater.\n- [3.](https://www.debateart.com/debates/950-the-bible-teaches-that-jesus-christ-is-god)\
    \ Against some guy who's 0-2 who plagiarised his argument.\n- And the last's claim\
    \ to fame was the spawning of some \"Mr Hitler\" quote, which doesn't suggest\
    \ a good debater, merely a \"funny\" opponent if anything.\n\n* Even if you think\
    \ any of these one debates were good, to be a good debater, you need to have more\
    \ than a single good debate. B has not shown this in any way.\n\n**My arguments**\n\
    \n**B does not have the traits of a good debater**\n\nOne criteria was\n\n1. **Beaten\
    \ good opponents**\n\n**B DOENS'T ADDRESS THE FIRST**. I clearly showed why combined\
    \ record is **_better_** than mere record- _\"more difficult to find 10 bad opponents\
    \ who've won 100 times than to snipe 100 people\"_. He **_DROPS_** that he has\
    \ not beaten anyone good and **_DROPS_** the fact that he hasn't debated people\
    \ with positive win records and **_DROPS_** that DROPS that his opponents combined\
    \ record is holistically BAD\n\nOnly rebuttal is that B first complains that I\
    \ \"cite my opponents more recent records, rather than what they were at the time\
    \ of the challenges.\"This is dumb. If I box someone and win, and they go on to\
    \ lose 20 fights, this surely should be taken into account for the opponent probs\
    \ was in decline and my achievement isn't that good.\n\nHe tries to explain his\
    \ bad combined record by saying his opponent forfeited rounds, however, this just\
    \ indicates a bad debater. If a lawyer misses 3 of his court dates, he is obviously\
    \ not a good lawyer even if he is a proficient speaker. **Part of debating is\
    \ showing up, forfeiting is not a strong excuse** (look at **good** debaters \\\
    [whiteflames, bones} they never forfeit)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- B hasn't\n\n*\

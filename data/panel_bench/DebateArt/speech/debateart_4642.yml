    Les Miserables is better than Phantom of the Opera


    Reasons


    1. The moral themes portrayed in Les Miserables are those of compassion, love,
    and the resilience of the human spirit, and those seen in Phantom of the Opera
    are understanding, love, and empathy, all of which are strong messages, and it
    would not be profitable to try and debate which of them are morally better. However,
    although they are all strong, the ones in Les Miserables inspire the soul to reformation
    and to strive for greater perfection, while those in Phantom of the Opera at most
    encourage empathy, and are therefore not as influential.


    2. The characters in Les Miserables are more distinct and likable than those in
    Phantom of the Opera despite that there are more of them.


    3. The characters in Les Miserables also experience more development than those
    in Phantom of the Opera; the whole plot of Les Miserables revolves around Jean
    Valjean''s reformation of character, while the characters in Phantom of the Opera
    hardly have time to develop due to the play''s short time frame.


    4. Les Miserables is more informative than the Phantom of the Opera as it accurately
    portrays life in the 1830s and the political struggles of the time.


    Conclusion\

    Les Miserables is a better musical than Phantom of the Opera because of its inspirational
    themes and characters.

  content: '**_Phantom of The Opera_** is a separate kind of novel/musical than **_Les
    Miserables_** that tells a completely different story.


    Certainly, the latter tells a very good story about a hero''s adventure from escaping
    and fighting oppression. It represents people and their struggles as a whole.\

    But _Phantom of The Opera''s_ symbolization goes even deeper than that.


    POTO is better because it is.:


    1. **An origin story.**

    2. **A story about growth, trauma, sadness, misery, isolation, and society''s
    vanity.**


    **Origin Story**


    People assume POTO is fictional, but the reality is it''s a true story.


    - The Palais Garnier Opera House is real. <https://www.operadeparis.fr/>

    - There is an artificial lake underneath the building and there once lived a decrepit
    phantom who was an architect that helped construct the place.

    - There was a damsel in distress named Christine.

    - Box #5 is famous.


    The mysterious phantom that lived in the Opera House frequently used the trap
    doors he built to access Box #5 when there was a musical performance going on.
    This seat is now reserved specifically for people who are willing to pay more
    to use it, but those audience members that do will still frequently report getting
    chills down their spine that they assume is the ghost of the Original Phantom.


    **France''s Superficiality**


    There is a vanity in France''s culture that the civilians can''t escape from.
    Art and music are significant parts that make it up. The Phantom who was born
    with a deformity so severe was despised by everyone living in that nation, and
    so was compelled to hide himself. Because of his insanity, he preyed on Christine
    and groomed her to be a successful musician. It''s this stalker and predatory
    nature that makes the audience observe with more horror and disgust.


    The Phantom''s creepier elements reflect the consequence of a country that is
    just as repulsive on the inside, as the Phantom is on the outside which also invokes
    sympathy.

  content: 'Con''s claim\

    Phantom of the Opera is better because it contains elements of truth and goes
    deeper with themes of growth, trauma, sadness, misery, isolation, and society''s
    vanity.


    Rebuttal\

    I agree with con''s first statement that Phantom of the Opera tells a completely
    different story than Les Miserables. Elements of truth, however, do not necessarily
    make a story better; perhaps they make it more appealing to fans who are interested
    in history, but also dispel some of the originality of it.


    And while the themes in Phantom of the Opera are all good, they do not go deeper
    than those in Les Miserables. See R1 argument.


    Conclusion\

    Les Miserables is better than Phantom of the Opera because of stronger themes
    and characters.


    Thank you for debating with me

    So Phantom of The Opera tells a story about Vanity & Isolation.


    The themes of a person''s metaphorical exile speaks layers to the special privileges
    aristocratic, wealthy, or beautiful people receive and how poorly those at the
    bottom are. It shows us that deep down, humanity is not as good as it pretends
    to be.


    And that equality exists only in imagination.

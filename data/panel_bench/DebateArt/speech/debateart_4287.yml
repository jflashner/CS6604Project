    \ you to vote afterwards.\n\nIn this debate, I will attempt to emphasize one central\
    \ point: that killing a baby is a bad thing. Perhaps I will have more difficulty\
    \ than I expect in establishing this point, as the killing of babies is often\
    \ convenient to justify. I expect we will hear many arguments that justify murder\
    \ for the purpose of economic convenience. I expect I we will also see babies\
    \ and human beings referred to as something other than babies and human beings.\
    \ But if we are to discuss abortion, it should be defined in simple terms, and\
    \ abortion is best defined as killing a baby. When a woman goes to a clinic for\
    \ an abortion, the doctor's job is to kill the baby, and if the baby is somehow\
    \ alive by the end of the procedure, an abortion has not been performed.\n\nTherefore,\
    \ I hold that abortion constitutes the killing of an innocent human being. But\
    \ when do human beings become human beings? The pro-choice camp does not provide\
    \ us with a singular answer, but science does. In Essentials of Human Embryology,\

    \ germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception). Fertilization\
    \ is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon)\
    \ with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the\
    \ haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes\
    \ to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid\
    \ cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.\n\nIn Medical Embryology,\
    \ Jan Langman writes:\n\n> The development of a human being begins with fertilization,\
    \ a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male\
    \ and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.\n\
    \nNote that the aforementioned zygote has its own unique human DNA. A Japanese\
    \ zygote implanted in a Ukranian woman will always be Japanese, not Ukranian,\

  content: 'Most of the arguments from my opening remain unchallenged, but my opponent
    does get a few things wrong, so I will dedicate this round to clearing them up.


    First, I find it odd that my opponent agrees on using the moral definition of
    murder and then uses the legal one anyway. This definition doesn''t necessarily
    even help their case because abortion is legally classified as murder in some
    places. Killing slaves used to be legal. Legality does not impact whether something
    is moral or not, so a moral definition should not depend on the law and change
    from one country to another. Therefore, I think we can reject my opponent''s definition
    as self-contradictory.


    A better definition will define murder as killing an innocent human being, regardless
    of immutable characteristics such as sex, race, sexual orientation, etc. My opponent
    has not contested that abortion fits this description, and so far, it''s clearly
    the superior definition used in this debate. My opponent asks how the unborn child
    is alive, which I already answered in my opening; the unborn child has a distinct
    set of DNA. A skin cell has the same DNA as whoever it belongs to, proving that
    it is part of that person''s body and not a separate organism. We know that an
    unborn child is a distinct organism and that they are biologically human. Because
    an unborn child is a human being, killing them is wrong.


    Cells are parts of organisms or organisms themselves \[[1](https://www.britannica.com/science/cell-biology)\].
    Different organisms have distinct DNA \[[2](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-is-a-structure-that-encodes-biological-6493050/#:~:text=Although%20each%20organism''s%20DNA%20is,arranged%20that%20differs%20among%20individuals)\].
    Because the cells that compose an unborn child have distinct DNA, they compose
    a distinct organism. So when my opponent says that unborn children do not behave
    like organisms, he is providing you with false information. What remains unchallenged
    is that the life of an individual human being begins at conception, as agreed
    on by 95% of biologists \[[3](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703)\].
    A skin cell is not an individual human being, making that comparison immaterial.


    A baby is a young child, or a human at an early stage of development. Because
    we agree that killing babies is wrong (and murder, too, as I think my opponent
    conceded) the scientific evidence resolves the question posed in this debate.
    Abortion involves killing an innocent human being, and it is therefore murder
    from the point of conception. Again, this definition is clearly preferable to
    the one presented by my opponent, as well as the most morally equitable.


    Therefore, as I stated earlier, my opponent must establish that an unborn child
    is not human, that an unborn child is not innocent, or that abortion does not
    involve killing an unborn child. In his first round, he established none of these
    things. Again, abortion involves ripping a baby''s limbs off, which is obviously
    murder. It''s very telling that my opponent ignores most of the scientific evidence
    in my opening and tries to obfuscate the issue. It''s clear he''s made a few biological
    claims that are patently false. So, while my opponent has failed to meet his burden
    of proof, the scientific evidence presented has made it pretty clear that abortion
    is murder from the point of conception.

  content: 'I defined murder is accordance with the description of this debate, which
    states, "This debate...will also not cover legality. Murder will be defined here
    in the moral sense. The burden of proof is shared." I''m not sure how my opponent
    reads that and decides that a legal definition fits the spirit of this debate
    more than a moral one. Laws are more inconsistent than morality, because moral
    statements are true ("Slavery is wrong") or false ("Genocide is good") whether
    or not we believe them.


    I agree that an unborn child is at a different stage of development than a grown
    adult, but this does not help my opponent''s case. Infants haven''t developed
    for as long as adults, but killing them is still murder. In fact, most people
    would save an infant rather than an adult because they have more of their life
    ahead of them.


    Abortion legality varies by location, and it''s not always as restricted as my
    opponent claims, but legality isn''t relevant to this debate so I don''t see a
    need to argue that point. My opponent appeals to human consciousness now as a
    standard for moral worth, which is quite different from their earlier definition
    based on legality. It seems that if it were legal to kill a conscious being, they
    should not consider this murder, based on their earlier definition.


    But consciousness is not a good indicator either because grown adults in comas
    aren''t conscious, and killing them is still murder. So I fail to see why unborn
    children not being conscious is a good reason to murder them.


    I think I''ve made my case quite clear. My opponent''s arguments are both contradictory
    and scientifically inaccurate. My opponent has failed to establish that an unborn
    child is not human, that an unborn child is not innocent, or that abortion does
    not involve killing an unborn child. Because my definition is more accurate and
    fits this debate better, that pretty much settles the resolution in my favor.

    Earlier, Pro mentions that a fetus is a "human being." But the term "human being"
    is used so loosely, that including a collection of cells in the definition, to
    which the word itself fundamentally has no meaning.


    Firstly, there''s a significant difference between being preconscious and unconscious.


    - Preconscious- Occurring before the existence of a consciousness.

    - Unconscious- The part of the mind which is inaccessible to the conscious mind
    but which affects behavior and emotions. Or not conscious.

    - Conscious- Aware of and responding to one''s surroundings; awake.


    Preconscious means there is no consciousness. Which is why the life of a fetus
    is more equivalent to that of a cell than an infant.\

    Unconscious means a consciousness is present, but it is turned off. (Implying
    that it was conscious prior to becoming unconscious and will likely become conscious
    again.)


    Just because a person has a disability that makes them unresponsive is not justification
    to kill them. But a person in a comatose state with zero chance of recovery is
    delaying the inevitable.


    > The description also requires that we define murder in the moral sense, so my
    opponent doesn''t have much ground to stand on here.


    Extend argument in the first Round about how the legal definition and moral definition
    are the same, but the difference being in what life holds value.


    Also, no specific moral definition is listed in the description and there is nothing
    in the rules saying we have to abide by Pro''s version. I suggest we go with mine,
    as it''s currently the most objective and consistent one.

  content: "FFMI:\n\nArnold reached his peak in 1974. At this year he weighed 237\
    \ lbs. Arnie's height is 6'2\\[2\\] - this makes him the tallest Mr Olympia winner.\
    \ The usual body fat of bodybuilders of his day was 6-8%\\[3\\]. I am going to\
    \ assume the lowest value at 6%.\n\nSo these are the stats\n\nweight: 237 lbs\\\
    \nheight: 6'2\\\nbodyfat: 6%\n\nso lets plop them into the ffmi equation and we\
    \ get a value of: 28.16\n\nNow it is considered that an ffmi of about 25 is the\
    \ the blurry natty limit and that going higher is likely impossible but bodybuilders\
    \ from the silver era of bodybuilding(a time of which their is no evidence of\
    \ steroid use as PED) have achieved similar FFMIs. Just look at Jack Deligner\
    \ in the 1949 mr America here\\[1\\]. He managed to reach above 25 ffmi(28.0 to\
    \ be specific) this is before the first use of Steroids as PEDs by the russian\
    \ weight lifting team. Steroids did exist since 1935 but they were used and advertised\
    \ to treat old men with urinary problems and men with depression(Something that\
    \ a young healthy and strong man of the time - especially a bodybuilder - wouldn't\
    \ take interest in)\\[4\\]. Their anabolic properties were not yet known very\
    \ well. Steve Reeves nor any bodybuilder of the silver era ever claimed to use\
    \ steroids\\[5\\].\n\nBody shape:\n\nThis is about the body shape - not exact\
    \ muscularity.\n\nAny man can train to look like arnie he just has to:\n\n- Put\
    \ the heaviest emphasis on the chest\n- Train the upper body more than the lower\
    \ body.\n- Have terrible traps and calves\n- Train your arms heavily\n- Barely\
    \ train your waist\n- Put mild emphasis on the abs\n- go to a low body fat percentage\n\
    - Check your mirror and compare yourself to this photo: <https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Arnold_Schwarzenegger_1974.jpg>\n\
    \nJust like him, I have a naturally huge chest - so does most males in my family.\n\
    \nExact proportions:\n\nThis is about trying to get at his exact proportions:\n\
    \nWell if you are as tall as arnie - as most men in my family are - well then\
    \ tough luck as I don't know if this is possible. Jack Deligner was 5'6 - with\
    \ less height, then there is less space to fill with muscle - this is why bodybuilders\
    \ are usually short.\n\nProportions according to <https://fitnessvolt.com/14662/arnold-schwarzenegger-biography/>\n\
    \nArms: 22\u2032\u2032 (56 cm)\\\nChest: 57\u2032\u2032 (145 cm)\\\nWaist: 34\u2032\
    \u2032 (86 cm)\\\nThighs: 28,5\u2032\u2032 (72 cm)\\\nCalves: 20\u2032\u2032 (51\
    \ cm)\n\nArms: 22 inch arms aren't really that impossible. In the silver era,\
    \ Leroy Colbert achieved 21 inch arms\\[7\\] And he existed before roids became\
    \ popular in Bodybuilding.\n\nChest: Arnold's chest is 57 inches. If you have\
    \ good chest genetics - like Arnold - getting near is much easier. Reeve's chest\
    \ was 52 inches\\[6\\]. I don't know if this is naturally possible.\n\nWaist:\
    \ Aronld's waist was his biggest weakpoint. Steve Reeve's waist was 29 inches\\\
    [6\\] - and he was also natural\\[5\\]. So not only can you get to Arnie's waist\
    \ size naturally but you can do even better.\n\nThighs: Leroy Colbert had 28 inch\
    \ thighs <https://www.greatestphysiques.com/male-physiques/leroy-colbert/>\n\n\
    Calves: Again I don't know, but Steve Reeve's Calves were 18.5 inches. But modern\

  content: 'Since we already know Arnold Schwarzenegger was on steroids during the
    year of 1974, then I suppose that part is irrelevant.


    Most bodybuilders consider Arnold''s 1974 physique to be the ultimate standard
    of perfection and most bodybuilders train in Good Faith for a lifetime and never
    reach it. (Training in Good Faith means they never cheat or abuse any illegal
    substance.) The fact that Arnold Schwarzenegger, someone who perhaps had one of
    the best genetics in terms of bodybuilding potential HAD to use steroids just
    to get to that level says all you need to know.


    So if Arnold''s physique is unattainable even for professional bodybuilders who
    are considered experts in their field, then that same logic probably applies to
    amateur or even non-competitive bodybuilders. And it is certainly true for the
    average person. It''s possible that few may achieve it, but this requires an exception.
    An exception neither breaks nor changes the rules.


    **Resolution Kritik:**\

    Despite what others say, Arnold''s peak was not 1974. (In Competitive Bodybuilding
    perhaps.) His physical peak would not be at least for another decade.


    In 1974, his hypertrophy/muscular development was the largest and his bodily proportions
    were the most symmetrical, but his peak year was 1981. The same year that **_Terminator
    2_** was filmed.


    While Arnold may have had the best physique in 1974 and gotten less smaller over
    the years and had the worst physique in 80''s. The year 1981 was when his strength
    and lifting ability was at its highest. So while Arnold''s muscles atrophied,
    his strength developed significantly. So despite being smaller, he was actually
    a lot stronger than he was in 1974.

    Arnold may have had the greatest physique, but I think saying he has the best
    genetics is going way too far. His waist was crap, his abs were crap - heck he
    had to find ways to distract attention from his abs. He had a waist of 34 inches(Stevie
    Reevie(Steve Reeves but this nickname is a joke) had a waist of 29 inches - and
    he was natural). Also just look at his abs - they suck. His legs are rather small.
    He has great genetics but not the best.

    So you just conceded.


    > "Despite what others say, Arnold''s peak was not 1974. (In Competitive Bodybuilding

    this source: <https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/body-work-complete-evolution-arnold/#:~:text=But%20many%20bodybuilding%20pundits%20agree,was%20Arnold''s%20most%20impressive%20showing>).

    Technically he retired in 1980

    He may have been stronger but I think most men would rather want to live in his
    1974 body. This debate is about muscularity, not necessarily strength.


    You didn''t really deal with any of my points and also what about Delinger - he
    was a genetic freak.

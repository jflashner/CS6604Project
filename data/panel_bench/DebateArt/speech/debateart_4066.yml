  content: '**Preamble:**\

    I will be defending three major constructive arguments which shall be the basis
    for nearly every point I make.


    **BOP:**\

    On-balance, so BOP is shared. I win if I prove that climate scientists and environmentalists
    are being dramatic when it comes to Global Warming and my opponent wins if he
    proves that the concerns are valid.


    **Contentions:**


    **l. The Cause of Carbon in the atmosphere is unknown.**\

    Humans are given a lot of credit for the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, but
    there is no way to know this for certain. Simply observing the atmosphere will
    not give you enough information to make a conclusion.\

    [DOE Explains...the Carbon Cycle | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-carbon-cycle#:~:text=Plants%20constantly%20exchange%20carbon%20with,carbon%20dioxide%20when%20they%20decay.)


    **ll. Vegetation releases CO2 into the atmosphere.**\

    There is more carbon in vegetation currently than there is in the atmosphere,
    and it is nearly impossible to judge that artificial technology is responsible
    for this phenomenon when vegetation is largely to blame for this too.


    **lll. Current models are underdeveloped.**\

    The DOE invested too much money into computer modeling and didn''t prioritize
    research enough. This is why current models cannot accurately capture what is
    actually going on. So, the warnings about Global Warming are all fearmongering
    based on predictions with nothing to support it.

    **Rebuttals**


    > **l. The Cause of Carbon in the atmosphere is unknown.**


    Irrelevant. The debate topic, in your own words, is whether "concerns with global
    warming are exaggerated." The cause of global warming is not addressed or necessary
    for this claim to be proven one way or another. Given that A. global warming exists
    (I will address this later) and B. "scientists and environmentalists" are concerned
    about it, then all that is left to be determined is if their concerns are in line
    with how serious the effects of global warming actually are.


    > **ll. Vegetation releases CO2 into the atmosphere.**


    This claim, on its face, is true. Like all aerobic organisms, the process of cellular
    respiration within plants consumes sugars and oxygen and releases carbon dioxide
    and water vapor. However, plants and other photosynthetic organisms, primarily
    cyanobacteria, also use carbon dioxide in photosynthesis to produce sugars, a
    process which also releases oxygen as a waste product into the atmosphere. On
    average, plants consume about 10 times as much CO2 in photosynthesis than they
    produce in cellular respiration.[\[1\]](https://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=2860#:~:text=plants%20produce%20approximately%20ten%20times%20more%20oxygen%20during%20the%20day%20that%20what%20they%20consume%20at%20night.)


    > There is more carbon in vegetation currently than there is in the atmosphere


    Yes, this is true. There are three major carbon sinks on Earth. Biomass, rock/soil,
    and the oceans. What Pro misunderstands is that these carbon sinks are storing
    and removing carbon from the atmosphere, not releasing it. The more carbon there
    is in plants, the less there is in the atmosphere.


    > it is nearly impossible to judge that artificial technology is responsible for
    this phenomenon when vegetation is largely to blame for this too.


    Strictly based on biomass alone, the sheer number of plants means that they produce
    more carbon dioxide on a daily basis than all of human activities, but as I said
    before, the net amount of carbon dioxide produced is negative, as plants take
    10x more out of the environment than they put out. Plants have been around for
    hundreds of millions of years, but atmospheric and core ice samples have definitively
    proven an massive upwards trend in atmospheric CO2 concentration only in the last
    300 years, coinciding almost directly with the industrial revolution and the mass
    burning of fossil fuels, as well as the beginning of a explosive human population
    growth. [\[2\]](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/) While it
    is not the only source of carbon emissions, human activity fits the bill as the
    one causing the sudden spike.


    > **lll. Current models are underdeveloped.**\

    > The DOE invested too much money into computer modeling and didn''t prioritize
    research enough. This is why current models cannot accurately capture what is

    A lack of information doesn''t mean that there is nothing to worry about. Uncertainty
    means that we should devote **more** resources to understanding what is going
    on, not less. This is the equivalent of saying, "there is _some_ evidence that
    there are sharks in the water, but not definitive evidence, so we should go swimming."


    **Arguments (reasons to be concerned)**\

    As already established, rise in CO2 levels (not to mention methane from mass-scale
    farming, other fossil fuel pollutants, and deforestation) is amplifying the ''greenhouse
    effect,'' essentially a giant blanket of gas and particulates that absorb escaping
    heat/light (photons), is causing average global temperatures to rise. This may
    not seem particularly dangerous at first, after all, temperatures around the world
    fluctuate on a yearly and daily basis, why should such a small change be that
    bad? Here are a few effects that global warming will have at its current pace.


    **Ice cap melting and sea level rise**


    Obviously, temperature increases translate into more melting, but the effects
    are more severe than that.


    1. Ice is reflective. The majority of light that hits the polar icecaps is reflected
    back away from earth. With decreasing amounts of ice, the amount of light instead
    absorbed by less reflective surfaces such as rock and water will increase with
    it.

    2. Ice stores carbon. As I said before there are three major carbon sinks on Earth:
    biomass, rock/soil, and the ocean. This last can arguably be broken into two,
    as ice stores carbon more stably than water. Since it''s solid, gas exchange between
    ice and air is extremely limited. As more ice melts, even more carbon is released
    into the atmosphere.


    Both 1 and 2 have a secondary effect, a positive feedback loop. As more ice melts,
    more light is absorbed and more greenhouse gases put into the atmosphere, which
    increases temperature, which melts more ice... you get the idea.\

    3\. Sea levels. While the Arctic icecap is floating, and therefore will displace
    just as much water in liquid form as solid, the Antarctic icecap and Greenland
    ice sheet are currently massive glaciers sitting on top of their respective landmasses.
    When both have totally melted, it translates to a 220 foot rise in sea level.
    Even a single meter of sea level rise would displace about 410 million people,
    not to mention destroy industry, plant life, and ecosystems in those areas. [\[3\]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23810-9)


    I''m feeling a little burnt out today, but I will be posting additional arguments
    in the next round if I feel it necessary.

    What would be the point of devoting most of our budget and resources to fixing
    a problem that is unfixable, if true, and would deplete our costs and quality
    of living? The fears of this ludicrous future catastrophe are doing more damage
    to mankind than Global Warming. By driving people insane and attempting to get

    > Climate change has happened many times in the past. It''s completely normal.


    Not all climate change is equal. If you had reviewed my source [\[2\]](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/)
    in round 1, you would see that CO2 levels over the last 800 thousand years have
    fluctuated between approximately 180 and 300 ppm, with each peak and valley in
    the tens of thousands of years apart. About 20,000 years ago, the last major ice
    age ended. Between then and 1750, CO2 had naturally risen to about 278 ppm. Then,
    in the last 300 years, it skyrocketed past all recorded trends, reaching 365 ppm
    in 2002 and 420 ppm in just 20 years after that. The rise to 278 ppm in 1750 was
    likely normal and may have even continued to rise over the next few thousand years,
    but the rapid and unfettered rise after that is _clearly_ not "normal."


    > What would be the point of devoting most of our budget and resources to fixing
    a problem that is unfixable, if true, and would deplete our costs and quality
    of living?


    No one said anything about devoting "most" of our budget. The U.S. spent $1.45
    trillion in 2022. [\[1\]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjprtShptn8AhWXCjQIHbbpBvEQFnoECDQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F)
    The same year, the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) was given $11.4 billion.
    This is only 0.78% of the federal budget.[\[2\]](%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fsystem%2Ffiles%2Fdocuments%2F2021-07%2Ffy22-cj-00-introduction.pdf&usg=AOvVaw00t38KHYe5ii6wuOU_Co5n)
    There is an argument that climate change is not unfixable, largely by creating
    an artificial cooling event, but this is a fairly complex issue that is still
    being debated by experts, so I will leave it out of this debate. Even so, understanding
    exactly what climate change will do and at what timescale will allow us to better
    prepare for the changes it will wreak on our way of life.


    > The fears of this ludicrous future catastrophe are doing more damage to mankind
    than Global Warming.


    You have provided no evidence of this.


    > By driving people insane and attempting to get rid of coalmining and power plantations,
    we are driving the risk of running people out of work for something we don''t
    even understand that well.


    Insanity huh? I''d love to see a study showing that climate change believers have
    a higher incidence of mental illness than climate change deniers.\

    On coal and other fossil fuels, climate change is not the only reason that we
    should be trying to move away from reliance on these options. Human consumption
    of fossil fuels is rapidly depleting the amount left in the earth for us to extract.
    Most estimates put oil as being effectively gone in 30-50 years, and coal at 70.[\[3\]](https://mahb.stanford.edu/library-item/fossil-fuels-run/)
    It is incredibly important that we replace or at least supplement our current
    energy infrastructure with more sustainable options before this happens, or we
    will see a massive recession as transportation and agricultural infrastructure
    starves to death.

    Pro fails to explain what he means by catastrophism. I can only assume that he''s
    referring to the various tectonic activities responsible for the formation of
    new land. Pro also fails to elaborate on what this has to do with the futures
    of inhabitants of these vulnerable coastlines. Is a person on a volcanic island
    less entitled to care about what happens to their homeland and property simply
    because it was produced by a different geological process?


    > Some of the changes in the environment are necessary for the continuity and
    preservation of life.


    The argument that change is necessary for life to continue is flimsy at best.
    Many types of organism have flourished for hundreds of millions of years with
    very little morphological differences, such as sharks and cockroaches. And even
    if some change is beneficial, rapid change on a global scale is decidedly not.
    Mass extinction events, such as the K-T extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs,
    resulted in approximately 76% of all plant and animal species alive at the time
    to go extinct. All of this was caused by a single asteroid causing what is known
    as an impact winter, which onset too rapidly for the majority of organisms to
    adapt to.\

    As I have already provided evidence of, current climate change is showing temperatures
    rising hundreds of times faster than historical trends, as well as exceeding the
    bounds of previous peaks.


    > So hurricanes and tsunamis are just natural phenomenons.


    Tsunamis are caused by earthquakes in the seabed, and have nothing to do with
    the climate.


    > The melting of the ice glaciers will cause a severe cooling event, as the heat
    causes the water to evaporate and there are a series of rainstorms.


    Pro provides no evidence of this. Furthermore, water vapor serves as a greenhouse
    gas, just as CO2, methane, and countless other atmospheric compounds, so if anything,
    this strengthens my point.[\[1\]](https://climate.nasa.gov/ask-nasa-climate/3143/steamy-relationships-how-atmospheric-water-vapor-amplifies-earths-greenhouse-effect/)

    **_"Negative effects of more CO2 have been exaggerated._** _Readily available
    data from governmental and reliable non-governmental sources confirm that extreme
    weather events in recent years have not occurred more frequently or with greater
    intensity. Such data also refute claims of ecologically damaging ocean acidification,
    accelerating sea level rises, and disappearing global sea ice and other alleged
    dangers. If further observations confirm a small climate sensitivity, these realities
    will not change."_


    We have proof that the CO2 in the atmosphere is actually good for the environment,
    since it is making the Earth greener.

    The subject of the argument is not whether or not CO2 is good for the environment,
    bad for the environment, or even if CO2 causes climate change or not (though I
    have already provided evidence of such). The resolution is whether or not concerns
    about climate change are valid or exaggerated. This final argument fails to address
    the resolution.


    As there are no new on-topic arguments to rebut, and any new arguments on my part
    would be cheating, I will rest my case here.

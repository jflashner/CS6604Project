    As the resolution states, there is no spectrum where there are alpha males and
    beta males in society. These roles only exist in small or tight groups.


    **Framework**


    As I am arguing a negative, this naturally means that the responsibility to prove
    that there does exist a hierarchy where some men fall into the category of beta
    males or alpha males falls to Con. If I can demonstrate the origin of this myth
    and explain how it works, then I win.


    **Alpha Male Lies & Origins**


    Self-proclaimed alpha males want to sell you on the idea that you''re a beta male
    because it works for their product.\

    The reality is there are no alpha males or beta males. I believe it''s more simple
    than that.: **You''re either a man or you aren''t.**\

    So the roots of this pyramid scheme have evolved from two people.: Fanboys and
    The Dating Coach or Fitness Guru that wants to preach them a lifestyle they can
    obtain without their help. This isn''t to say their advice doesn''t work. Only
    that their intention is to make money by profiting off of you and these results
    are attainable without their help.


    Let''s look at The Johnny Bravo Complex.


    **Hierarchy & Status**


    People defend the idea of the alpha male by appealing to the level of attention
    they receive from women and their glamorous lifestyles. If a man makes six figures,
    has a great body, and is handsome enough. Then he will attract more women. While
    it''s true he appeals to more women, it is only a certain demographic of women.
    The richer you are, the more women you will attract, but only a specific type
    of woman. Meanwhile, he does attract more women but more women might also find
    him less attractive because they see him as unattainable, so they pursue someone
    in their league.


    Plenty of rednecks and white supremacist see Donald Trump as an alpha male, but
    there are others who just see him as a narcissistic manchild that reeks of insecurity
    and fake bravado. But compared to Andrew Tate, Donald is just some elderly, fat
    politician. The same fans who worshiped Trump would just as easily replace him
    with someone who is a bigger personality, like Andrew. If Andrew Tate openly criticized
    Trump for being a weak beta male, those same people who praised Trump for speaking
    truth to the left would not hesitate to turn on him and lynch him.


    There are also old-school scholars and people of today''s time who praise Winston
    Churchill for being a traditionally masculine man, but he was no Clint Eastwood
    or **Theodore Roosevelt**. Churchill was a binge-eating chain smoking alcoholic
    who was slightly shorter than the average man of his time and he walked with a
    cane. While his ideas of race and politics might be associated with stereotypically
    traditional masculine men, Winston was the furthest thing from traditionally masculine.


    Theodore on the other hand was into.:


    - Fitness.

    - Hunting.

    - Combat sports.


    Winston was into.:


    - Drinking to excess.

    - Binge-eating.

    - Chain-smoking.

    - Reading.


    All of the things that Winston did are the exact opposite of what a stereotypical
    alpha male does and yet, it stands that Winston is considered one of the most
    masculine men in history.: <https://www.artofmanliness.com/character/advice/motivational-posters-winston-churchill-edition-part-i/>


    So before we can assess whether such a hierarchy exists, we need to determine
    one thing.


    **The Definition of an Alpha Male**


    First of all, what is an alpha male and what determines if one man is more alpha
    than another?\

    Jordan Peterson is a god of his domain, but his profession isn''t regarded as
    conventionally masculine. Yet, Jordan Peterson is a huge role model for guys that
    try to become alpha males.


    If the answer to this intrinsic question is that an alpha male is strong, aggressive,
    well-disciplined, and a good worker. I would counter that these are all qualities
    all men possess and should strive to possess. And do all alpha males have to be
    muscular? Because my example of Winston Churchill proves this isn''t the case.


    Who would be more an alpha in this following example? If we take Mariusz Pudzianowski
    in the prime of his lifting days and compare him to Andrew Tate when he got the
    World Kickboxing Title Championship, who would be considered more of an alpha
    male?\

    Mariusz is absolute trash at fighting, but he''s the World''s Strongest Man. Yet,
    we have Andrew Tate who is one of the world''s best fighters, but he''s nowhere
    near as strong as Mariusz Pudzianowski.


    Now another critical question.


    - Is Johnny Bravo a Chad Alpha Male or not?


    Let''s look at the positives.: He''s tall, handsome, fashionable, and is muscular.


    But the problem is despite these qualities.: He gets no chicks, has no game or
    charisma, is not very popular, and still lives at home with his mom.


    **Conclusion**


    There is no specific definition or criteria of what an "alpha male" is. My definition
    in the description provides an example, but nobody can really define it. Inconsistencies
    are too widespread in these gender norms that it makes the term ''alpha male''
    fundamentally meaningless.


    So the following is my conclusion.: **_You''re either a man or you aren''t._**


    It doesn''t get any more complex than that.

    \ women will prefer the one with an alpha personality over the one with a beta\

    *Alpha- Alphas are confident, dominant, charismatic, and thrive psychologically\

    \ Sigmas are confident lone wolves who do not seek social attention. They are\
    \ often perceived as mysterious & charismatic.\n\nBeta- Followers of the Alpha.\
    \ Betas play safe and avoid risks. They are reserved and prefer to get along and\
    \ fit in.\n\nDelta- The average normal guy. They are society\u2019s worker drones\
    \ who see themselves as more alpha but are somewhere between alpha and beta.\n\
    \nGamma- They are bitter & introspective. At odds with the hierarchy, they fail\

    \ him as unattainable\n\nThis is the incorrect way to interpret a woman saying\
    \ someone is out of their league. It isn't that they see them as less attractive,\
    \ they see themselves as less attractive and unable to attract someone on that\
    \ level. There are virtually no women who don't prefer more money, tallness, handsomeness\

    \ If you disagree it's either that you think he's a pussy or you just don't want\
    \ to associate him with something you think is inherently a compliment. There\
    \ are plenty of alpha males who are narcissists, douche bags, manchilds etc. You\
    \ can even be a pussy when it comes to physical confrontation and be an alpha\

    \ leadership roles and has a belligerent style of doing things.\n\n> Who would\

    \ is that it assumes there\u2019s a distinction. But in Pop Culture and social\
    \ media, the two are regularly considered synonymous.\n\n**Roles of Hierarchy**\n\
    \nThe reason why there are no alpha roles in communities is because there is always\
    \ bigger fish. This is especially true because even if there are men with natural\
    \ leadership tendencies, communities have shared values that appeal to a wide\
    \ majority of people. With such diversity, it is impossible for a man to assume\
    \ an alpha role. Now if he's an established member of the community, he may be\
    \ one of the popular ones or the leaders, but displaying the characteristics normally\
    \ associated with an alpha leads to them being replaced by someone else within\
    \ the community.\n\n- A man can only be alpha to the followers that consent to\
    \ his authority.\n\nBack when Pro Wrestling was in its early days, the team _Evolution_\
    \ had the following people on its team.: Triple H, Randy Orton, Ric Flair, and\
    \ Dave Batista.\n\nAll of these men are considered alpha males, but only one of\
    \ them actually held the title of the alpha and that was Triple H, as he was the\
    \ leader of Evolution. The rest of the members did as he told them to do. Triple\
    \ H's rivalry with Randy Orton is especially important because Randy looked up\
    \ to and respected Triple H, but when he did something the latter didn't like,\
    \ Triple H kicked him out of the gang and simultaneously, the other pack members\
    \ also turned on Randy.\n\n**The Meaning of \"Alpha Male\"**\n\nAnother problem\
    \ with the Alpha and Beta typology is that it has no clear definitions, no criteria\
    \ in which to categorize it objectively. To refer to someone as an alpha male\
    \ in the general sense is seen as a compliment, but is not necessarily accurate.\

    \ majority of the outer world, he is a pariah and a blowhard. He commands fear\
    \ because of his access to nuclear weaponry and the threat of using it, but nobody\
    \ actually respects him or feel threatened by him personally.\n"

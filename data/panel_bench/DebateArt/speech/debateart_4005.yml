    We have long passed the stage where Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King needed to
    take stand for their rights on public transit. Unless there is any proof that,
    other than professional organizations, public transits do prevent minorities from
    taking them, this point means nothing.

    \[citation needed\]\

    I demand Pro to not only illustrate instances of these phenomenon(which Pro has
    not), but also correlation to show why they should be installed.


    **2. Definitions**


    [Install](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/install)


    > **:** to set up for use or service\

    > **:** to be set up for use or service **:** to undergo installation


    These two entries are the ones in my opinion fitting best with the topic itself.
    The examples include:


    > had an exhaust fan _installed_ in the kitchen\

    > _install_ software\

    > The software _installs_ automatically.


    In the context of installing a fan and installing a software, both went from a
    state of **unused** to a state of **being used**. Nobody would call repairing
    a fan that has been working for years "installing the fan" or updating a software
    "installing a software" The fan needs to be brand new and the software needs to
    be not on the computer prior in order to be called "installing".


    What this means, is that to install a cable car, a new cable car must be produced
    and placed on the cables where it can then operate. What this also means, is that
    meaningfully and pragmatically, only pre-use cable cars can be "installed" as
    if a cable car has already been in use, it can only be repaired or transfered,
    however, it can never be "installed".


    Now let''s take a look at the topic statement.


    > cable cars should be installed


    This topic is not


    > We need more cable cars in the world


    And this topic is not


    > More cable cars should be put into use


    The topic is specifically phrased in this way, whether intentional or not, and
    because of the way it is phrased, the emphasis is on:


    > **A purpose of** (An unrestricted set of) **Cable cars** (In an restricted moment
    of time, assume modern society?) **is to be for installation**


    The definition of [Cable Cars](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cable%20car)
    is:


    > **:** a vehicle moved by an endless cable:\

    > **a**\

    > **:** one suspended from an overhead cable\

    > **b**\

    > **:** one that moves along tracks


    Note, it does not say that a vehicle that can be moved by a cable is a cable car(if
    I strap an elevator to a pulley system on the cable car, before that process,
    the elevator is NOT a cable car, even if pulleys are strapped on it before it
    is put on actual cables). In order for a vehicle to be a cable car, it must be
    able to:


    - move along an overhead cable

    - OR move along a track powered by cables


    What does that mean? This means that in order for a cable car to be a cable car,
    it must be installed. A cable car, before being put on the cables or the tracks,
    is not able to be moved by the cables or along the tracks, therefore, cable-caresque
    objects that are not installed on cables or tracks, including ones that would
    later become cable cars upon installation(this installation is not one by a cable
    car, rather, an actual cable car is the end product, not the ingredients), are
    NOT cable cars due to them not satisfying the abilities the dictionary definition
    required them to selectively satisfy.


    The previous sentence is and should be seen as a logically coherent sentence.
    Similar examples include "Before I became a teen, I was back then a child." "Before
    injecting carbon and other metals, the steel was majorly composed of the element
    Iron." Yes, before a cable car is installed, it is something else, just not a
    cable car.


    Because a cable car isn''t yet a cable car until it is installed, that means the
    term "installed" cannot realistically apply to ANY cable cars, because all cable
    cars are already installed. The topic statement becomes as absurd as statements
    with entirely incompatible state signifiers such as:


    - Biological men should be pregnant

    - Children now should be adults

    - Atheists ought to believe in a god


    As such, I argue for the opposition of the position that supports a claim that
    is impossible. I rest my case.


    **Conclusions**


    - Due to dictionary definitions, all cable cars are already installed.

    - An installed thing cannot be installed from the present state because it has
    already been installed.

    - Therefore, Cable cars can''t be installed, and thus they shouldn''t be installed
    for this reason.

    clear, and rebute what I understood.)\

    First, about impactless points, I meant that the disabled people can also enjoy
    the area by cable cars. You can find a graph that shows disabled people travel
    more than others. For example, physical disabled people like someone who can''t
    walk have difficulties when they want to see the beautiful view on the top of
    the mountain. But cable cars can take them to the top.\

    Next, by installing cable cars, the surrounding commercial district can develop.
    Cable cars can take people where they cannot go by themselves, or if it is a long
    distance but it cannot be traveled by other transportations. When cable cars are
    installed, then more people would visit to that area because they can go to that
    area''s landmark easily by cable cars. So when many people visit that place, they
    would be more likely to spend money near that landmark. That is why I said the
    surrounding commercial district will develop.\

    And also because cable cars are sky transportation, it does not distract the traffic.
    It is considered to resolve the traffic gem.


    **install-to put something in place so that it is ready for use**\

    **So installing cable cars could mean creating a new one in somewhere, not removing
    the old one.**

    - Pro did not even put dedicated skepticism on whether or not my definition is
    accurate, so we will keep it the way it is.

    - Pro gave NO links to anything, not even names of scientific journals or even
    news articles, to prove Pro''s points despite saying there are evidence.


    * These points should be seen as not entirely impactless but with relatively little
    impact whatsoever.


    Sources are needed to prove that cable cars are worth installing, or are even
    possible to install.


    **Restatement**


    I restate my definition and examples for "install" that has gone uncriticized
    over the course of the rounds:


    > [Install](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/install)

    >

    > > **:** to set up for use or service\

    > > **:** to be set up for use or service **:** to undergo installation

    >

    > These two entries are the ones in my opinion fitting best with the topic itself.
    The examples include:

    >

    > > had an exhaust fan _installed_ in the kitchen\

    > > _install_ software\

    > > The software _installs_ automatically.


    Pro does attempt to bring up a defintion, which not only seemingly was sourced
    from nowhere but agrees with the entries presented just above. There has been
    no contentions on the fact that in order for something to be installed, it must
    transform from a state of being unused to a state of being used. There has been
    no contentions on that when something is already installed, it cannot be installed
    again because it is already in usage.


    The definition of [Cable Cars](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cable%20car)
    is:


    > **:** a vehicle moved by an endless cable:\

    > **a**\

    > **:** one suspended from an overhead cable\

    > **b**\

    > **:** one that moves along tracks


    This uncriticized definition rules out any vehicle that is not moved by a cable,
    on a track or not. Before I strap my car(whether it is a minivan or a supercar)
    onto a cable midair or on the ground, it is not a cable car, again. Similarly,
    before a cable car is a cable car, it is not. Before a cable car is able to be
    moved on a cable, it is not one. It is therefore settled that only those vehicles
    on their respective operational cables count as cable cars. In other words, only
    cable cars that are installed are actual cable cars.


    Since all cable cars are already installed, it is impossible to install them again.
    Therefore, the action the topic concerns is impossible.\

    **Conclusions**


    - Due to dictionary definitions, all cable cars are already installed.

    - An installed thing cannot be installed from the present state because it has
    already been installed.

    - Therefore, Cable cars can''t be installed, and thus they shouldn''t be installed
    for this reason.

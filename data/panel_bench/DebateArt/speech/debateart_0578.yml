    Some ideological differences between liberals and classical liberals:

    tend to want these banned\

    -Stance on Economic freedom in general. Classical liberals tend to want the government
    out. Liberals want the government in to help poor people.\

    -Stance on the Environment. Classical Liberals want less environment regulation.
    Liberals want more environment regulation.\

    -Stance on Affirmative Action. Classical Liberals want selectment on the basis
    of merit. Liberals want more racial diversity.\

    -Stance on Religious freedom. Classical Liberals support religious freedom for
    refusing to bake a cake for gay people. Liberals want to get the cake baker to
    bake the cake in the name of gay liberation.


    Classical liberals and liberals have very different ideologies. One is more libertarian,
    the other has way more identity politics in it.\

    These are just some of the differences between Liberals and Classical liberals.

    I am so fucking sick of the intellectual dishonesty and silly word games on this
    site. People who have the same ideology can disagree on things that aren''t fundamental
    to that ideology. Not only are you trying to semantically knit pick at the debate
    title instead of actually debating me like an intellectual coward, but your stupid
    assertion doesn''t even make any sense from a purely grammatical standpoint.


    All of the differences you pointed out do not change the simple fact that liberals
    and conservatives are both capitalists in support of a semi-democratic republic
    system. They have the same ideology, which was originally called classical liberalism.


    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism>


    > Stance on Guns. Classical Liberals tend to want to legalize AK 47s. Liberals
    tend to want these banned


    So you''re telling me the ones who want LESS liberal gun laws are more liberal?
    You may disagree on how liberal to be about certain issues, but you are both liberals
    in general.


    > Stance on Economic freedom in general. Classical liberals tend to want the government
    out. Liberals want the government in to help poor people.


    There is really an insignificant difference between libs and cons in this regard.
    So liberals want to raise the taxes a bit and have a few more social programs,
    big deal, they still aren''t changing the overall system. And don''t use extreme
    examples like Bernie Sanders or AOC because they are not even liberals but soc-dems.


    > Stance on the Environment. Classical Liberals want less environment regulation.
    Liberals want more environment regulation.


    More environmental regulations means more economic freedom, because it opens up
    the market to more clean and sustainable energy and loosens the grip that moneyed
    interests invested in major pollution-causing industries have on the free market.


    > -Stance on Affirmative Action. Classical Liberals want selectment on the basis

    Affirmative action is not universally agreed upon by liberals.


    > -Stance on Religious freedom. Classical Liberals support religious freedom for
    refusing to bake a cake for gay people. Liberals want to get the cake baker to
    bake the cake in the name of gay liberation.


    So one group of CLs cares more about religious liberty, the other cares more about
    gay liberty, what''s the big whoop?


    > Classical liberals and liberals have very different ideologies. One is more
    libertarian, the other has way more identity politics in it.


    Just a stupid right wing talking point. Do you even realize when you say "libertarian"
    you are saying you are more LIBERAL than the liberals?\

    They believe in a blend of ideologies. For example, I would classify myself as
    a far right libertarian. I believe in some right wing ideologies, such as abolishing
    the income tax and abortion, but I support weed rights and homosexuality rights.
    At the same time, I prioritize religious freedom over gay marriage, so if a religious
    store owner doesn''t want to bake a cake for homosexuals because of his religion,
    then go ahead.

    I was referring to the ideology between classical liberals and liberals. If there
    is as much as one non "classical" difference between them that I can point out,
    then I have won.


    > All of the differences you pointed out do not change the simple fact that liberals

    Most liberals and democrats favor socialism over capitalism ([1](https://news.gallup.com/poll/125645/Socialism-Viewed-Positively-Americans.aspx))


    > So you''re telling me the ones who want LESS liberal gun laws are more liberal?


    Yes. Liberal the way the left defines it in this context is, "freedom from mass
    shootings and from homicide". This means more restrictive gun laws.


    Democratic liberalism wants equality instead of freedom.

    Pro immediately concedes that there is a non classical difference between classical
    liberals and liberals. Even if he negated it, it still exists. It is a significant
    difference. [2](http://www.governing.com/topics/politics/gov-2017-9-issues-to-watch.html)
    states that out of the 9 issues that were important enough to be mentioned(and
    issues like abortion didn''t even qualify for the list, despite [3](https://news.gallup.com/poll/183449/abortion-edges-important-voting-issue-americans.aspx)
    stating that 21% would be their deciding issue and 67% (21%+46%) have it as at
    least one important issue), 5 of the issues are economic related.


    Economic issues are important to America, more important then abortion, which
    had 0 issues make this highly selective list.


    > > Stance on the Environment. Classical Liberals want less environment regulation.
    Liberals want more environment regulation.

    >

    > More environmental regulations means more economic freedom,


    More environment means less economic freedom because it involves carbon taxes,
    which restrict business power, and it is the government telling you how to power
    your business. There are good arguments on both sides for this. However, Liberals
    tend to like it, Libertarians/Classical liberals tend to not like it. Lets see
    why you believe it generates economic freedom:


    > because it opens up the market to more clean and sustainable energy


    The market has been open up for alternative energy for a long time. My house has
    solar panels on it. It''s been a good investment, but it should not be forced
    upon anyone. Liberal politicians, like those in California, required every new
    house to have solar panels on it([4](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/09/california-approves-plan-to-mandate-solar-panels-on-new-homes.html)).
    The Classical liberal probably would have objected to this. The modern liberal
    would probably support the decision as what NBC did.

    [5](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/22/public-strongly-backs-affirmative-action-programs-on-campus/)
    states that 78% of Democrats support Affirmative action. A majority of the left
    supports it.


    > So one group of CLs cares more about religious liberty, the other cares more
    about gay liberty, what''s the big whoop?


    This is another concession to the title of this debate.

    On the contrary, if there is one single thing that is "classical" about them then
    I have one.\

    See how much of a dick you''re being?


    > Most liberals and democrats favor socialism over capitalism


    First of all a liberal/democrat is capitalist by definition (that is not to say
    "democracy" itself is, because Communism is actually the most democratic system
    known to man, the American party is what I''m referring to.)


    Second of all the source you provided claims that the majority of left leaning
    people view socialism as mostly positive, not that they prefer it to capitalism.
    The vast majority of Americans don''t even know what socialism is, the left thinks
    social democracy is actual socialism in the classical sense and the right just
    thinks socialism means the government controlling everything.\

    If you ask the same liberals if Bernie Sanders'' version of socialism goes a little
    too far they will mostly say yes, and Bernie Sanders'' platform is social democracy,
    not even full democratic socialism.


    > Yes. Liberal the way the left defines it in this context is, "freedom from mass
    shootings and from homicide". This means more restrictive gun laws.

    >

    > Democratic liberalism wants equality instead of freedom.


    You are both trying to be liberal in different ways. Right leaning CL''s want
    the freedom to say "nigger" and posses murder weapons and left leaning CL''s want
    the freedom to do drugs and murder their babies.


    > Pro immediately concedes that there is a non classical difference between classical
    liberals and liberals. Even if he negated it, it still exists.


    Look at every president in US history, none of them were Ron Paul libertarians.
    There is a reason for this, because the establishment only allows you to have
    significant power if you do not threaten the establishment. Democrats and Republicans
    are virtually the same thing, this is because they serve the same established
    order, the same ideology. The system that arose from the philosophy of classical
    liberalism.\

    So the big significant difference you refer to does not exist in the actual system,
    it only exists among the "alt right" and "alt left" who don''t have any real power
    in the system. Social Democracy and hardcore right wing Libertarianism are considered
    fringe in America and do not count as classical liberalism.


    > The market has been open up for alternative energy for a long time. My house
    has solar panels on it. It''s been a good investment, but it should not be forced

    The Classical liberal probably would have objected to this. The modern liberal
    would probably support the decision as what NBC did.


    This whole discussion is irrelevant to the debate since I''ve already established
    that this does not make liberals not liberals. But I would however point out that
    you are not considering who actually benefits from lenient regulations on the
    environment. This is not about forcing the consumer to invest in solar panels,
    it''s about loosening the grip that wealthy investors have on the free market
    because they are invested in oil related stocks and bonds etc. They do not care
    about what is more sustainable, they only care about profit, and thus their decisions
    are often worse for society and the environment than it is for them. The decision
    of whether or not we shit on the environment should not be made based on what
    is more profitable, because the rich will surely make the wrong decision for us
    and the right one for their purse. So some industries need to be choked out so
    others can have breathing room and these greedy rich cunts will be forced to invest
    in better alternatives that may be less profitable for them.


    In sum, none of your arguments prove that liberals are not classical liberals.
    Since you claim that just one difference between libs and cons makes them something
    entirely different I am going to say the opposite just to be as much of a dick
    head as you are, if there is so much as one similarity then I automatically win.
    Of course, their entire core ideology is the same so I automatically win no matter
    what.\

    Do your standards in this debate apply to other things, or just when it''s convenient
    to you? For example, are shi''ite and sunni Muslims still both Muslims even though
    they have a few differences?

    Most liberals aren''t capitalist as I have cited. Liberals want equality (<https://www.diffen.com/difference/Conservative_vs_Liberal>).


    > Second of all the source you provided claims that the majority of left leaning

    If they view socialism as positive, they almost always if not, then they will
    always view capitalism as negative. How can you be both a capitalist and a socialist?
    Capitalists believe you should keep what you earn. Socialists believe everyone
    should have the same amount of money.


    > Right leaning CL''s want the freedom to say (the hard n word) and posses murder
    weapons and left leaning CL''s want the freedom to do drugs and murder their babies.


    Classical liberals want all of these things and the freedom for more stuff, such
    as to not get taxed as much.


    > Democrats and Republicans are virtually the same thing, this is because they
    serve the same established order, the same ideology.


    They contradict themselves on numerous issues.


    > Social Democracy and hardcore right wing Libertarianism are considered fringe
    in America and do not count as classical liberalism.


    Being a social democrat is essentially the same thing as a democratic socialist,
    which isn''t "fringe" as the Bernie Sanders/AOC crowd, which is pretty big tends
    to support socialism/social democracy/democratic socialist/whatever term you plan
    on using to describe this belief.


    > they only care about profit, and thus their decisions are often worse for society
    and the environment than it is for them.


    That is the free market. The free market also enables you to get alternative energy,
    which is good for the environment. If you don''t like it, tour Venezuela.


    > if there is so much as one similarity then I automatically win


    No. You said they were the same ideology except one was more classical and the
    other was more liberal.


    > it''s about loosening the grip that wealthy investors have on the free market


    Liberals support regulations on businesses necessary to improve the lives of society
    and to improve the environment. Classical liberals are reluctant to regulations
    because they believe that the market will fix it due to competition.


    > The decision of whether or not we shit on the environment should not be made
    based on what is more profitable, because the rich will surely make the wrong
    decision for us and the right one for their purse.


    The Classical liberal would not say this. The liberal position would.


    > For example, are shi''ite and sunni Muslims still both Muslims even though they
    have a few differences?


    They have a similar ideology, but they don''t have the same ideology because they
    disagree on who should be their ruler.

  content: '**Topic : Quran is not word of god**


    **Oath** - define as"a solemn attestation of the truth or inviolability of one''s
    words""a promise, especially that you will tell the truth"


    **Oath** taking action is done by human only as he can speak and can communicate.Human
    takes swears or oath to justify that he is talking or speaking truth , no animal
    , non living and living except human can''t take so as an oath to justify there
    speech of truth .


    In short, I am saying that oath taking action is only done by human.


    **Argument** : _God can''t take oats as he is creator himself. why should he have
    to take oaths ? , to show that he is speaking truth ?_


    **Sources** :Night and Day (Al-Fajr 89:1-2)


    Stars (An-Najm 53:1)


    Quran ( Al-Qalam 68:1)


    Human Soul (An-Nisa 4:1)


    Mountains (Al-Baqarah 2:143


    Wind ( Al-Furqan 25:48)


    Time (Al-Asr 103:1-3)


    Heavens (Al-Baqarah 2:22)


    Earth ( Al-Baqarah 2:22)


    Angels ( Al-Baqarah 2:102)\

    Day of Judgement (Al-Fajr 89:1-3)


    The creation and commandment of Allah (Al-A''raf 7:54)The alternation of night
    and day (Al-Fajr 89:1-2)


    The creation of man (Al-Baqarah) 2:28


    The soul and its inspiration as to its wrong and its righteousness (Ash-Shams
    91:7-8)

  content: "**_The Quran in Defense of legitimacy_**\n\nThe Quran unlike the Bible\
    \ has never changed from its original form. The Bible on the other hand has many\
    \ versions which many speculators assume is because Kings changed the Bible to\
    \ fit their needs in making the population servile. Muslims have studied the Bible\

    \ the Bible both were written by prophets and/or apostles who interpreted the\
    \ speech of the divine. It is wrong to say that the Quran is a oath but a way\
    \ to spread the wisdom of God(Allah). It is up to the individual man to either\
    \ embrace the true word of God or to reject it. Since the Quran was written by\
    \ people, you would expect them to write the holy book using their own culture\
    \ and time period as reference. For example the word love in the English translation\
    \ of the Bible was much different in the Greek version. Love in Greek had three\
    \ words. Ag\xE1pe meant love for humanity. \xC9ros meant romantic love. Philia\
    \ meant love between equals such as friends. A interesting fact is that Philadelphia\
    \ means brotherly love. So when you look at a specific word in the Quran, you\
    \ must understand that words evolve overtime and the implications may change since\
    \ the Quran is a old text.\n"

  content: '\_**Counter Argument**\_God is a super intelligent being that encompasses
    everything. Everything is God and God is everything. He knows all and because
    of that we do not always have the privilege to question him. But do not be mistaken
    that whatever God does has logic behind it even if one does not see it.


    I can only humbly assume that God meant to give an oath that the Quran was true
    to convince his flock that this book is true. Since the Quran was not written
    by God directly and by divine interpreter, God confirmed that the content inside
    was true by taking the oath. Remember that before the Quran was written the Arabian
    peninsular was divided with 360 Gods, each day was a different God. The prophet
    Mouhamad united the Arabians and in order to convince them that what he says is
    true he needed God to swear on it as one can imagine it was hard to change your
    religion out of nowhere after many generations. In our current day, a faithful
    person will dare not question the authority of God but people before being introduced
    the wisdom of God would have undoubtfully questioned God.


    Note: I understand that English is not your second language nor is it mine. I
    apologize if I was unable to answer your questions or if I understood them wrong
    because it was a little difficult to understand what you was trying to **specifically**
    ask.

    God is everything and everything is god , is it ?\

    God is person who lie?\

    God is the male who rape?\

    God is who kill people behalf of jihad?


    God do rapes because it has logic behind it?\

    God Knows everything that we even don''t know, so we don''t have rights to ask
    your god , what''s reason behind it !


    If raping is bad ? Why god do rape?\

    Lying is bad ? Why god lie?\

    Kill the unbeliever?\

    Women''s are the farm yield them as u want ?\

    Why god is saying this if the quran is claimed true as by god swear/oath?


    Sorry i am asking questions.


    Define GOD ?


    > Since the Quran was not written by God directly and by divine interpreter, God
    confirmed that the content inside was true by taking the oath.


    Quran wasn''t word of god ?\

    God just confirmed it. Okay


    Quran is not word of God


    Hence proved,Quran is just confirmed by god .


    Muhammad said to people that god allah has swear on quran on day on night on creation
    of human etc ,\

    Even god didn''t said by himself , god use muhammd as a medium to Convey.


    No proof that god himself swear, all words are trough muhammd,


    Difficult to say , which are the words of god and which are the words of muhammd!!


    Else you accepted that Quran is not the word of god.


    > Since the Quran was not written by God directly and by divine interpreter, God
    confirmed that the content inside was true by taking the oath.


    God taken oath to confirm that quran is ture in quran itself.


    Before completing quran he already taken swear on that quran itself , intresting.


    But debate is over as you agreed that **quran is not word of God**


    _It was nice to have a debate with you, if u have further response we can continue,
    thank you._

  content: '**_Quran is the word of God_**\

    Of course the Quran was now written directly by God but by Divine interpreters.
    But nevertheless Quran is the word of God. For example of an author of a book
    would hire a **type-writer**. who would type whatever the author said. The book
    would still be considered the word of the author as it was him who created the
    idea. Muhammed is the physical manifestation of God who was send to spread his
    word and in the example he is the **type-writer**.


    **What is God?**\

    God is not just a independent entity that watches and knows all. God is all because
    he created all. God is not a physical being as we like to see him as. God is what
    connects all matter and all being. Their was a study done in the State University
    of Southwestern Bahia in Brazil that concluded that all atoms are connected to
    each other. They tested this by growing bacteria in a petri dish and once it has
    grown, they split it in half. They put the first half on one side of the campus
    and the other half the other side. They electrocuted one the separated bacteria
    and the surprising thing is that both bacteria who was far apart had the same
    effect from the electricity. All things are connected and God is that universal
    connection.


    **If God is everything then how can he merely sit back when humans are immoral?**\

    God can do anything and do not be mistaken that God dislikes our degenerate behavior.
    Though he is intelligent enough to realize that he created man so that he may
    have free will. If God was to step in and stop all horrifying events to happen
    such as the Holocaust or slavery it would result in a utopia where God is the
    dictator. God is not a tyrannical being and allows for us to think for ourselves
    so that we can share the wisdom of God. Also it is wrong to label God as a mere
    bystander of deadly sins because he keeps track of all of our sins so that one
    day we may be judged. Us living is God giving us a chance to repent and to be
    ultimately forgiven. It is not God that is rapping but the being that God gave
    freewill to whose mind is clouded by primitive emotions.

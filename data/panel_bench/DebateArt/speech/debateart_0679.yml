  content: "1 Timothy 2:4 says: \"\\[God\\] will have all men to be saved, And to\
    \ come unto the knowledge of the truth. \"\n\nHow could this be true if God selects\
    \ only certain people to go to heaven? In fact, Why would he create certain people\
    \ in the first place if he wasn't going to allow them to enter heaven? It makes\
    \ no sense. In fact, It would entail controlling their free will:\n\nJohn 14:6:\
    \ \"I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except\
    \ through me. \"\n\nSo one has to **choose** Jesus in order to enter heaven. However,\
    \ In the Calvinist view, We've already been selected to go to heaven. Why do we\
    \ have to choose if God's chosen us already?\n\nBesides this, You're basically\
    \ saying that God has condemned people to sin beyond their free will, But God\
    \ hates sin more than anything else. So you're essentially saying that he created\
    \ people to do something he hates **and they can't control it.**\n\n2 Peter 3:9:\
    \ \"The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, As some understand slowness.\\\
    \nInstead\\\nhe is patient with you, Not wanting anyone to perish, But everyone\
    \ to come to repentance. \"\n\nWhy would he have to be patient and **wait** if\
    \ he had already chosen who goes to heaven and who doesn't? It simply wouldn't\
    \ matter. In the Calvinist worldview, God has created people to go to hell simply\
    \ because he can, But that completely goes against the God that the Bible preaches.\n\
    \nJohn 3:16: \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son,\
    \ That whosoever believeth on him should not perish, But have eternal life. \"\
    \n\nThis says that God loves the **entire** world, And **whoever** believes in\
    \ Jesus shall go to heaven and have eternal life, Not only those he supposedly\
    \ hand-picked.\n\nBesides this, If we were pre-destined, There would be no point\
    \ in missionaries or spreading the word, Because those who go to heaven will go\
    \ regardless of whether they hear of Jesus or not and those who will go to hell\
    \ will go whether they hear of Jesus or not.\n\n1 Peter 3:15: \"but sanctify Christ\
    \ as Lord in your hearts, Always being ready to make a defense to everyone who\
    \ asks you to give an account for the hope that is in you, Yet with gentleness\
    \ and reverence;\"\n\nWhy would we be called to minister to people who can't actually\
    \ make a choice themselves?\n\nAnother point is that sin wouldn't matter at all,\
    \ But look at Hebrews 10:16: \"For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving\
    \ the knowledge of the truth, There no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, \"\
    \n\nThis shows how we **can** lose salvation, But that is not true in this Calvinist\
    \ view.\n\nA common Calvinist scripture is Ephesians 1:4-5. However, that view\
    \ of it is not true. In 1:13 it specifically says: \"And you also were included\
    \ in Christ when you heard the message of truth, The gospel of your salvation.\
    \ When you believed, You were marked in him with a seal, The promised Holy Spirit,\
    \ \"\n\nThey were included in Christ when **they** believed, Also known as **choosing**.\
    \ For more context, 1:1 says \"Paul, An apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of\
    \ God, To God\u2019s holy people in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus\"\n\n\
    He is talking to Christians here: \\_\"\\__The Calvinist contends that certain\
    \ individuals were chosen before the world began and predestined to become believers,\
    \ But that is simply not what the text says. Paul teaches that those \u201Cin\
    \ Him\u201D have been_ _**predestined to become**_ _\u201Choly and blameless\u201D\
    \ and \u201Cto be adopted as sons, \u201D but he never says that certain individuals\
    \ were predestined to believe in Christ. Paul is speaking of what \u201Cthe faithful\
    \ in Christ\u201D (vs. 1) have been predestined to become, Not about God preselecting\
    \ certain individuals before the foundation of the world to be irresistibly transformed\
    \ into believers. \"'_\n\n<https://soteriology101.com/2016/03/16/answering-calvinistic-proof-texts/>\n\
    \nActs 13:48 is usually used out of context to explain the Calvinistic point.\
    \ If you look at the context of that scripture, It is a setting where there are\
    \ Jewish people, and then there are Gentiles. God is giving his favor to the Gentiles\
    \ and giving them a revelation because they have been humble and received his\
    \ word. God simply chooses to spread his blessings through Israel.\n\nActs 13:8:\n\
    \n\"Therefore, My friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness\
    \ of sins is proclaimed to you. 39 Through him everyone who believes is set free\
    \ from every sin, A justification you were not able to obtain under the law of\
    \ Moses. \"\n\nThis says that **can** get forgiveness if we believe, and it says\
    \ **everyone.**\n\nAnother scripture used is 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14. However,\
    \ Context tells us how Gentiles were continually condemned by Jews, And God was\
    \ saying that Gentiles were included in his plan. Also, He says that he chose\
    \ them **through sanctification** and **belief** of the truth, So if your view\
    \ was correct, God would be controlling their wills and **making** them believe\
    \ in him. However, We know this not to be true.\n\nOver to you! :)\n"

    If you knew everything from wind strength, angle, and friction and knew the order

    I shall not flex a single verse, I shall make it clear that there is absolutely
    no element of our use of our conscious will that God wouldn''t know, be aware
    of and either actively alter or refuse to alter and let happen (knowing it always
    would have ended that way based on the starting ingredients and way things inevitably
    would play out).

    God himself has shown that he will allow us to make our own choice regarding our

    of a scripture like this is John 3:16: "For God so loved the world that he gave

    No, it is not. All you have proved is that God is omnipotent, omnipresent, and

    When Con tells us that this is wrong because the human is doing the action based
    on a choice the resulted from chemistry in their brain or perhaps manipulation
    of their soul via God, Con is conceding that everything in the Bible that regards
    choice and action fails to disprove Calvinism. Here is why:


    If all choices that humans make are known beforehand by God (as in the decision,
    every single factor going into their thinking etc) and every action that humans
    do is orchestrated by God either by altering the path later on or having intentionally
    known it would happen by his infinite, ever-present awareness and knowledge of
    all reality and ''soul-possessing''.


    It doesn''t matter that the Bible says choice, that it says ''those that do this
    get this'', it also says the choice they make is incapable of being anything other
    than God''s.

    debate so I''m just going to leave it as it is.


    God knows everything, including psychology, words you will say so much so that
    in the story of Jacob he got them to reject their brother as children in envy
    of him being the favourite child so that he would become King elsewhere and reunite
    with them at a later time and forgive them. This is literally the definition of
    using people as pawns and all the planning that went into it (including manipulating
    each and every person, animal and non-living entity that came into contact or
    would have come into contact with Jacob and his brothers) for this ending to happen
    shows that God is very willing to manipulate free will as and when he pleases.
    Consequently, if God knows all and is everywhere at all times aware of all things
    and he is definitively the most powerful entity with infinite capacity at said
    powers, it follows that all that happens is his choice as even if he doesn''t
    actively stop something happening it all came from his original knowing of events
    unfolding and he created everything to begin with as well.


    > **4** God made everything with a place and purpose; even the wicked are included
    - but for judgment. **5** God can''t stomach arrogance or pretense; believe me,
    he''ll put those upstarts in their place. **6** Guilt is banished through love
    and truth; Fear-of-God deflects evil. **7** When God approves of your life, even
    your enemies will end up shaking your hand. **8** Far better to be right and poor
    than to be wrong and rich. **9** We plan the way we want to live, but only God
    makes us able to live it. It Pays to Take Life Seriously **10** A good leader

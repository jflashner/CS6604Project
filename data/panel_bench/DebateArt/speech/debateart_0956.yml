  content: "Thanks for accepting the debate. Hopefully you are a serious opponent\
    \ as the rules say. Good luck.\n\nIf the earth was flat, it would effects gravity,\
    \ time, the seasons and life on earth in many ways.\n\n**Gravity**\\\nHypothetical\
    \ point: Since the earth is supposedly flat, then it must have edges. If the earth\
    \ is flat, the center of the earth would feel normal, but as you move toward the\
    \ outer edges of the earth, gravity would begin to push you back towards the center\
    \ of the earth. Gravity pulls objects toward the center. On a round planet, it\
    \ pulls you toward the ground, but on a flat planet gravity would pull you toward\
    \ the center of the flat disc-like earth. This means as you got closer to the\
    \ edge, it would pull you backward toward the center. It would feel like a sensation\
    \ of climbing up a steep hill, or perhaps carrying excessive weights. Plant stems\
    \ also grow opposite to the direction of gravity. If the earth were flat, as you\
    \ got closer and closer to the edge, plants would begin to grow at an angle. The\
    \ further away from the center, the more intense the angle plants would grow.\
    \ If you reach the edge of the disc, would you fall off and into space? No. You\
    \ wouldn't fall off to space just as you wouldn't on a spherical earth. Gravity\
    \ keeps you stuck to the earth.\n\nRealistic point: The spherical earth. A person\
    \ can walk forever on earth, and it will never end. Why? Because 1. The earth\
    \ is round. 2. Gravity keeps them bound. 3. If the earth was flat, there is no\
    \ way that a person can continuously walk the earth or jog for miles, because\
    \ if they reach the edge of the earth they won't be able to continue. There is\
    \ a marathon runner named Dean Karnazes who basically ran majority of the earth.\
    \ This is just a taste of what he's done. (1)\n\n- - Ran 350 miles (560 km) in\
    \ 80 hours and 44 minutes without sleep in 2005\n- - Single-handedly completed\
    \ \"The Relay\", A 199-mile (320 km) run from Calistoga to Santa Cruz, Eleven\
    \ times.\n- - Ran a marathon to the South Pole in \u221213 \xB0F (\u221225 \xB0\
    C) temperatures without snowshoes in 2002\n- - Ran a marathon in each of the 50\
    \ states in 50 consecutive days in 2006.\n\nThat alone effortlessly debunks the\
    \ earth being flat. If the earth is flat how is he able to run half the world?\
    \ If the earth is flat, It would be impossible or extremely difficult for him\
    \ to jog that much.\n\n**Time**\\\nIf the earth were flat, time would also be\
    \ effected. Currently everyone on earth sees sunrises and sunsets at different\
    \ times, but if the earth were flat, time zones wouldn't exist. Because of longitude,\
    \ someone in New York sees the sunrise approximately 3 hours before someone in\
    \ California and every point in between New York and California the sun rises\
    \ at a different time. This is because the earth is round. If it were flat, everyone\
    \ would see the same sunrise and sunset and everyone on earth would set their\
    \ clocks at the same time.\n\n**Seasons**\\\nOur seasons would also be drastically\
    \ different if the earth were flat. Everyone on earth would experience summer,\
    \ winter, spring and autumn at the same time. You know how when it's summer in\
    \ the United States it's winter in Australia? This is because the sun's rays which\
    \ are perfectly parallel strike the earth at different angles during different\
    \ parts of the year. If the earth were flat, the sun would always strike the earth\
    \ at the same angle which would mean that everyone on earth would experience the\
    \ same seasons at the same time of the year.\n\n**Lunar Eclipse**\\\nWe would\
    \ also not be able to see lunar eclipses in the same way we do now. The shape\
    \ of our round earth's shadow is what creates the lunar eclipse. If the earth\
    \ were flat that means there's only one possible orientation that the sun moon\
    \ earth alignment would create a circular shadow. Lunar eclipses would only occur\
    \ at a midnight position, but the sun, earth and moon perfectly aligned.\n\n**Other\
    \ planets**\\\nSince you think the earth is flat, does that make other planets\
    \ flat as well? Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, are\
    \ all of those flat?\n\nThe earth is not flat. It is very round, an almost perfect\
    \ sphere.\n\nIf that didn't convince you or other flat earthers then I don't know\
    \ what will. Await a response.\n\nSource:\\\n(1) - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Karnazes>\n"

  content: 'It''s not a deceiving quote. It''s clear as day and understandable but
    somehow you misunderstood and went full blown Christian on me. You may even be
    a troll. How unfortunate, I did say serious debaters only. This obviously isn''t
    a religious debate, that''s why I didn''t add "No religious argument" in the description,
    it wouldn''t have made sense. I typed my comment to you BEFOREHAND so you seen
    it before you even responded to my argument, hence you quoting what I said. If
    that was the case, you could have simply followed my rules and not include religion
    in 99% of your argument but of course you did, meaning you did not follow my rules.
    2+2=4? Math has nothing to do with this. The earth is round. The earth is in the
    shape of a sphere. A sphere is round. A flat disc is not round, it is flat. Yes,
    it''s shape is round but overall, it is flat. Whereas, a sphere earth is definitely
    more round than the hypothetical flat earth.


    If you aren''t a troll and if you are serious about this debate, then prove it.
    I will ask you a series of questions which will be my argument this round. Please
    answer them to the best of your ability and as accurately as possible. Provide
    sources if need be. Refrain from the excessive religious arguments. It''s annoying.
    By the way, I''m a Christian.


    **Questions |** **My R1 effortlessly debunks the earth being flat so I will just
    be asking these:**


    1. Since the earth is flat, I''d like you to give me an estimate of how big you
    think it is. Give me an accurate circumference. If you can that is.


    2. It''s seems as though you and many other flat-earthers deny the fact of gravity
    existing. In your case, let''s ignore gravity at the moment pretending as if it
    doesn''t exist for these questions. With gravity being nonexistent, how would
    things operate?


    3a. If the earth is flat why and how have people sailed ships around it twice
    over without ever falling off?


    3b. **(Point)** It is possible to see the effect of the curvature of the earth
    from sea level (ships disappearing over the horizon)


    04. If the earth is flat, what happens to the oceans? Wouldn''t they just spill
    over the edge?


    05. How would seasons work? How would GPS and satellites work on a flat earth?


    06. **(Point)** If you are high enough in an airplane, the curvature of the earth
    is very apparent. Airplanes overlap the earth.


    07. If the earth is flat why has nobody ever been able to find the edge or even
    document it?


    08. If NASA has supposedly faked thousands of images of the round earth, why isn''t
    there even one picture of the edge?


    09. Why would so many people be pretending that the earth is round? What benefit
    of lying about the shape of the earth serve? What exactly would it gain?


    10. If the earth is flat, then how are the rest of the planets in the solar system
    spherical?


    11. The earth''s layers. The inner core, outer core, mantle and the crust, something
    of which the spherical earth does have. If the earth is flat, then what''s inside
    the flat earth? Is the inner core still in the center?

  content: ".\\\nKING_8,\n\nWhen I accepted your debate, and seeing that I am a TRUE\
    \ Christian, I was obviously going to use Jesus\u2019 inspired words for the topic\
    \ at hand, understood? At this point, you could have saved yourself further embarrassment\
    \ and walked away, but you didn\u2019t! Therefore, what happens from this point\
    \ forward as you blaspheme Jesus the Christ is your decision, understood?\n\n\
    Within context, you don\u2019t want me to use the bible regarding that the earth\
    \ is flat because of its eventful outcome, then in turn, you do not use Satanic\
    \ Science to help you insidiously prove that the earth is not flat, but an assumed\
    \ GLOBE, and not \u201CRound\u201D like you stated when you slipped on your Freudian!\
    \ GET IT?\n\nREMEMBER, my Jesus is watching (Proverbs 5:21-23), therefore I have\
    \ to follow His inspired word when He states that I, and other Christians, are\
    \ to defend his faith and precepts at all costs that the earth is flat, do you\
    \ understand? Huh? Maybe just a little bit?\n\n_\"We destroy arguments and every\
    \ lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive\
    \ to obey Christ,\" (2 Corinthians 10:5)_\n\n**YOUR SATANIC QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED\
    \ AS FOLLOWS:**\n\n1. Since the earth is flat, I'd like you to give me an estimate\
    \ of how big you think it is. Give me an accurate circumference. If you can that\
    \ is.\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:** Only Jesus, as our Jewish Yahweh god incarnate,\
    \ knows the specific circumference. Conversely, you do not know the true estimate\
    \ of how large Jesus\u2019 Milky Way is, because your Satanic Science keeps changing\
    \ it!\\\n<https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/milky-way-galaxy-may-be-much-bigger-we-thought-ncna876966>\n\
    \n3a. If the earth is flat why and how have people sailed ships around it twice\
    \ over without ever falling off?\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:** Firstly, I am sure that\
    \ there is more than two times that ships have sailed the oceans to the other\
    \ side, agreed? That being said, this is easily done because Jesus allows it:\
    \ _\u201CSo Jesus said to him, \u201CUnless you see signs and wonders you will\
    \ not believe.\u201D (John 4:48)_\n\n3b. **(Point)** It is possible to see the\
    \ effect of the curvature of the earth from sea level (ships disappearing over\
    \ the horizon)\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:** The \u201Cassumed\u201D curvature of the\
    \ earth is nothing more than a mirage, or an optical illusion caused by atmospheric\
    \ conditions.\n\n4. If the earth is flat, what happens to the oceans? Wouldn't\
    \ they just spill over the edge?\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:**  Yes.\n\n5. How would\
    \ seasons work? How would GPS and satellites work on a flat earth?\n\n**MY GODLY\
    \ ANSWER:** By working like they do now because Jesus allows it: \"_While you\
    \ stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the\
    \ name of your holy servant Jesus.\u201D (Acts 4:30)_\n\n6. \\*\\*(\\*\\*Point)If\
    \ you are high enough in an airplane, the curvature of the earth is very apparent.\
    \ Airplanes overlap the earth.\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:** Again, the refraction of\
    \ light from the sky's atmosphere shows an optical illusion of curvature. This\
    \ has already been addressed, please do not repeat yourself again.\n\n7. If the\
    \ earth is flat why has nobody ever been able to find the edge or even document\
    \ it?\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:** Because when Jesus' creation get to the edge of\
    \ the earth, they immediately go to the other side without knowing it. **_\u201C\
    _**_You are the God who works wonders; you have made known your might among the\
    \ peoples.\u201D (Psalm 77:14)_\n\n8. If NASA has supposedly faked thousands of\
    \ images of the round earth, why isn't there even one picture of the edge?\n\n\
    **MY GODLY ANSWER:** This is simply because they are looking at the TOP of the\
    \ ROUND flat earth. Duh.\n\n9. Why would so many people be pretending that the\
    \ earth is round? What benefit of lying about the shape of the earth serve? What\
    \ exactly would it gain?\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:** By proving that our bible Jesus\
    \ God exists when His word states that the earth is flat, H-E-L-L-O, anybody home\
    \ today?\n\n10. If the earth is flat, then how are the rest of the planets in\
    \ the solar system spherical?\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:** This is easily addressed\
    \ that Jesus obviously wanted the earth to stand out amongst his other creations\
    \ in His planetary system, therefore, he made our living area flat.\n\n11. The\
    \ earth's layers. The inner core, outer core, mantle and the crust, something\
    \ of which the spherical earth does have. If the earth is flat, then what's inside\
    \ the flat earth? Is the inner core still in the center?\n\n**MY GODLY ANSWER:**\
    \ Yes\n\nKing_8, to be honest, you are going to have too step up your game because\
    \ I am falling asleep with your juvenile rhetoric, AND I am truly tiring of your\
    \ insolence towards Jesus and his written word within the scriptures showing that\
    \ His earth is indeed flat! Notwithstanding, your puerile statements relative\

    \ what point do you come to terms with your blatant ignorance upon this topic?\
    \ You have yet to understand that Jesus\u2019 words trumps man\u2019s alleged\
    \ understanding of things in the 21st century. _\u201CBut Peter and the apostles\
    \ answered, \u201CWe must obey God rather than men.\u201D (Acts 5:29)_\n\nThe\

  content: 'Ignoring all of your religious bullshit, it''s annoying. Of course you
    answered all the questions incorrectly and it was not accurate. You just based
    them off of Jesus. On to argument.


    Being skeptical is important, sure but when the evidence is overwhelming and the
    science testable and provable there comes to a point where a question has an answer
    and there''s hard hitting facts smack dab in front of your face, And by denying
    those facts, It is blind-sided. Is the earth flat? No it''s not. It is round.
    The flat earth theory has been debunked time and time again but still many flat-
    earthers persist with their views. This shouldn''t even be a theory.


    There''s definitely a deeper reason as why people believe in a flat earth, and
    that has a lot to do with psychology. According to Karen Douglas, a psychologist
    at the University of Kent, that studies the psychology of conspiracy theories
    -- Flat earther''s conspiracy theories share a basic trust. They present an alternative
    theory about an important issue or event, and construct a vague explanation for
    why someone is covering up that true version of events. The power in that conspiracy
    lies in the fact that they are vague, and they give people a sense of security,
    control and comfort that they don''t otherwise have. Flat-earthers gather in forums,
    online communities and at conventions to talk about their beliefs. The flat earth
    society gives them a sense of community. Honestly, what people don''t realize
    is that many flat-earthers say the earth is flat but don''t actually believe it,
    as in it''s just one huge joke or a way to get attention. I wonder, are you one
    of those people? Enlighten me. I''m still convinced that you are either a troll
    because of your heavily religious argument or you might even be "Our_Boat_is_Right"

    \ firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction\
    \ in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.\" (Titus 1:9)**_\\\
    \n**_\u201CPreach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke,\
    \ and exhort, with complete patience and teaching. (2 Timothy\u201D 4:2)_**\n\n\
    You have yet to completely understand that when one is a TRUE Christian, then\
    \ we have to follow ALL, and I repeat, ALL of the precepts and doctrine of the\
    \ inspired word of Jesus the Christ whether or not we oppose them, or do not like\
    \ them, period! We do not have the option to usurp Jesus\u2019s words as God incarnate\
    \ because if we do, then we are committing the UNPARDONABLE SIN! **Unfortunately,\
    \ you have committed the UNPARDONABLE SIN, and the ramifications thereof, with\
    \ your disparaging words towards Jesus where I am truly sorry in your behalf.**\n\
    \nIn closing, and in simple terms for you to hopefully understand, you cannot\
    \ have your cake and eat it too, understood? You cannot be an assumed Christian,\
    \ then at the same time, slap our Jesus the Christ in the face by stating that\
    \ he was wrong in promoting that the earth is flat as shown in the direct passages\
    \ in question.\n\nKing_8, you have a lot to learn, and the clock in ticking towards\
    \ your eventful demise upon Judgment Day.\n\n.\n"

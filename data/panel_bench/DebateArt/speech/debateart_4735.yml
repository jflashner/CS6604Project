    Pain is evil.\

    Abortion doesnt cause pain.\

    Abortion prevents pain and all the other evils person would have to experience
    during life.


    Abortion is morally necessary.


    Child birth is murder and torture, since by giving birth to a child, you are causing
    that child to be tortured and die.


    Will he get run over by a car? Be raped? Be murdered? Commit suicide? Die painfully
    from cancer? Be bullied? Be beaten up? Be depressed? Will he be a rapist? Will
    he end up in prison?


    I hope you dont actually expect a child to thank you for putting him through that.
    I certainly dont thank my parents.


    In fact, waking up from eternal darkness into the world of pain that will last
    for 80 years, only to return to eternal darkness again... I would have preffered
    to stay in eternal darkness. No pain there.


    Life, on the other hand, is pain. Causing person pain is wrong. Causing a person
    to live is wrong.


    Happiness doesnt outweight the pain, nor should we hurt people so that we are
    happy.

  content: 'My opponent''s argument from Round 1 contains two monumental errors.


    First, the notion that all pain is evil is wrong. St. Paul clearly states suffering
    can be a moral good. He writes:


    > Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces
    endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and
    hope does not put us to shame, because God''s love has been poured into our hearts
    through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. (Romans 5:3-5 ESV)


    Second, my opponent states:


    > Life, on the other hand, is pain. Causing person pain is wrong. Causing a person
    to live is wrong.


    Arguing that not living is better than living is self-evidently wrong. Although
    every human will experience pain and many humans will mistreat other humans. living
    is superior to not living since life is a gift from God. To quote U.S. Senator
    Ted Cruz:


    > I believe every human life is a gift from God and we should cherish and protect
    and celebrate them. (<http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/cruz-refuses-answer-personhood-during-msnbc-town-hall>)


    Furthermore, since life is a gift from God and all gifts from God are good, life
    is good.

    Anyway.


    All pain is evil.


    Consider the following scenario.


    You have to endure eternity in greatest pain. However, you can press the button
    to stop living and simply die and stop feeling pain forever.


    Everyone will press that button.


    Same scenario applies to life in general. Life is not a gift. Its torture.


    You get tortured and you die. What kind of a gift is that? Better not give people
    such gifts.


    If God is good, why does he allow evil?


    Good God by definition wouldnt allow evil. Good God would create perfect humans,
    not flawed ones. How come perfect God created a world full of death and torture?
    Would you create such world if you were God?


    If you saw a drowning child, would God expect you to save it?


    Why doesnt God save it? Cant bother?


    Anyway.


    Life doesnt outweight pain. Pain outweights everything. Abortion saves a child
    from pain, sending that child and that child''s child and the entire line of offsprings
    straight to heaven. Cant get better

  content: 'Sadly, my opponent''s argument contains many errors.


    First, any debate concerned with morality is religious _per se_. My opponent is
    welcome to cite any religious source.


    Second, the scenario of having to endure the greatest possible pain for eternity
    sounds like the definition of Hell. Furthermore, aborted infants, according to
    Dante''s _Inferno_, go to Hell since they have not been baptized (_Inferno_ Canto
    IV. lines 33-42). Therefore, abortion results in causing the victim (aborted infants)
    to have to endure the greatest possible pain for eternity with no magic button
    to escape.


    Third, C.S. Lewis explains why God allows evil to occur.


    > God created things which had free will. That means creatures which can go either
    wrong or right. Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but
    had no possibility of going wrong; I cannot. If a thing is free to be good it
    is also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then,
    did God give them free will? Because free will though it makes evil possible,
    is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.
    (_Mere Christianity_ Book II. Chapter 3)

    What a great and loving religion lmao


    Sending infants to hell. I mean, are you sure that your God is not mentally ill?


    > any debate concerned with morality is religious


    No. We just proved that religion has no morality.

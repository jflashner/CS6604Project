  content: '**x. Default to con**


    - Pro bears the burden here, so con need not provide an argument, and simply showing
    that con has not sufficiently upheld his burdens grants con the debate.


    **x.1. Propositions**


    - There are three propositions embedded within the resolution.


    1. The minimum wage is a bad thing.

    2. The Minimum should not be raised.

    3. The Minimum wage should be abolished.


    - Proving merely one of these contentions to be false would necessitate that pro
    has not proven the resolution. Additionally, placing even one of the claims under
    the scrutiny of doubt disfavors the instigator in this contest.


    **Constructive negation**\

    **I. Impact on employment**\

    Raising the minimum wage would cause more people to be unemployed.


    - This seems untrue. Many credible economic analyses such as those cited [in this
    report](https://s27147.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/NELP-Data-Brief-Raise-Wages-Kill-Jobs-No-Correlation.pdf)
    indicate almost the opposite. Even analyzing all the times the United States has
    [increased wages](https://www.nelp.org/publication/raise-wages-kill-jobs-no-correlation-minimum-wage-increases-employment-levels/)
    seems to show they led to increases in employment.


    > The results were clear: these basic economic indicators show no correlation
    between federal minimum-wage increases and lower employment levels, even in the
    industries that are most impacted by higher minimum wages. To the contrary, in
    the substantial majority of instances (68 percent) overall employment _increased_
    after a federal minimum-wage increase.


    **II. Impact on economy**


    - The minimum wage [increases consumer spending](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/small-businesses-get-boost-15-minimum-wage/#:~:text=A%20study%20by%20the%20Federal,the%20course%20of%20a%20year.),
    which generates more revenue for the country as people purchase more products,
    which generates more money/revenue for businesses. It also increases [worker productivity](https://inside.tru.ca/2022/02/22/raising-minimum-wage-boosts-productivity-study-finds/),
    which will save these businesses more money long term.


    **Rebuttal(s)**


    > Minimum wage was originally created by racists...


    - This claim is unsourced and consequently unsubstantiated. Even if it were true,
    this is the \[genetic fallacy\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy#:~:text=The%20genetic%20fallacy%20(also%20known,origin%20rather%20than%20their%20content.).
    Many things were implicated in racist practices like the [Cotton Gin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin),
    yet it does not logically follow that we ought to ban them today.


    > Minimum wage would cause workers to be much more expensive to hire


    - (See II). With the minimum wage, people would have more money to pay for things,
    you can see this in its implicative effects [increasing consumer spending](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/small-businesses-get-boost-15-minimum-wage/#:~:text=A%20study%20by%20the%20Federal,the%20course%20of%20a%20year.).
    Consequently, the minimum wage also provides more money for businesses while granting
    them new [increased worker productivity benefits](https://inside.tru.ca/2022/02/22/raising-minimum-wage-boosts-productivity-study-finds/).
    If a business has slightly more expensive labor costs, but also makes significantly
    more revenue what matters is the proportional or marginal increase of costs, not
    the total increase.


    > The 13th amendment already outlaws work without pay


    - Slightly tangential, but not true. The 13th amendment outlaws slavery. [Internships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship)
    are typically workless pay and are perfectly legal.

    I was not saying we should ban something because of its racist history. I was
    pointing this out to show that racists created the minimum wage to keep blacks
    out of jobs, since back then businesses didn''t see blacks as worth the money.
    This is put here to show that minimum wage would cost jobs and the original founders
    of minimum wage knew it would lead to unemployment.

    you are spending the same amount of money as you bring in. Workers would be more
    productive if they started with a lower wage and if they worked hard they would
    get a raise.

    Involuntary work without pay is the literal definition of slavery.

  content: '**x(.1)**


    - Extend as its applicability is evident in this two-round debate. Bearing the
    burdens, pro drops a series of random links without even responding to the majority
    of my arguments.


    **Constructive negation**\

    **I. Impact on employment**


    - My argument and sources in this contention were not responded to, and are thus
    dropped by the instigator. Instead, he posts two links in response without context
    or analysis. There are glaring issues with this unorthodox response as well.

    - Pro''s sources only evaluate the impact of raising the minimum wage drastically:
    _doubling_ the current $7.25 dollar wage to 15 dollars. However, the resolution
    only entails discussion about increasing the minimum wage _at all_, not to any
    particular amount. We can increase the minimum wage in smaller portions incrementally
    [as done historically](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history/chart).
    Historically, [a 7-dollar increase in the minimum wage occurred over the span
    of 71 years](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history/chart), whereas
    pro cites the implications of a policy that increases the minimum wage by _over
    the same amount in 4 years_. My cited research shows that our incremental increase
    of wages holds no negative impact on employment levels or jobs and even on balance
    _increase employment_, rendering pro''s sources irrelevant. "[Seven decades of
    historical data](https://www.nelp.org/publication/raise-wages-kill-jobs-no-correlation-minimum-wage-increases-employment-levels/),"
    that "[find no correlation between minimum wage increases and employment levels](https://www.nelp.org/publication/raise-wages-kill-jobs-no-correlation-minimum-wage-increases-employment-levels/)"
    indicate this. Thus pro has not proven that the minimum wage should not be increased,
    especially if we can increase it incrementally and slowly over time, and improve
    the economy and business revenue while having no negative impact on employment.


    **II. Impact on economy**


    - This contention is majorly dropped, and I extend it. The only response I can
    detect from pro is in my subsequent rebuttals which does not address the contention
    as a whole. In summation, the minimum wage provides:


    1. Increases in \[worker productivity\](http://worker productivity), generating
    more revenue for businesses and improving our economy.

    2. Increases in [consumer spending](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/small-businesses-get-boost-15-minimum-wage/#:~:text=A%20study%20by%20the%20Federal,the%20course%20of%20a%20year.),
    adding the same benefits.


    **Re. Genetic Fallacy**


    - Pro''s "sources" do not even suggest that the minimum wage purposed "[to stabilize
    the post-depression economy and protect the workers in the labor force](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/minimum_wage#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20the%20minimum,and%20well%2Dbeing%20of%20employees.),"
    was created by racists to keep blacks out of jobs. His research is careless and
    ridiculous. For one, he posts the same article twice (published on different platforms)
    that only vaguely mentions various past _industry_ wages which are irrelevant
    to our debate, and do not support his proposition for _the minimum wage_.

    - Even his Forbes article points to singular cherry-picked examples of racist
    people who support these laws in different countries, which has no bearing on
    the minimum wage itself. Regardless, despite disproven, even if one was to buy
    such a statement the origins of a policy do not invalidate its current use and
    benefit to all people and asserting such would simply be the genetic fallacy (Rebuttal
    1).


    **Rebuttal(s)**


    > If they can even find a job


    - Not only does pro-drop my counter-argument on the increases in revenue in parallel
    to the cost increase (showing all that matters is proportional or marginal labor
    costs from revenue, which pro has not provided), his response shows he does not
    even understand his own argument which is on the existence of the


    > ...Workers would be more productive if they started with a lower wage and if
    they worked hard they would get a raise.


    - Unsubstantiated claim, as well as previously disproven. Pro does not even attempt
    to make a baseline credible or analytic response to my proposition of this counter
    case.


    > Involuntary work without pay is the literal definition of slavery.


    - Pro stated the 13th amendment outlaws work without pay, he did not mention anything
    about it being voluntary or involuntary. Thus his previous assertion is false
    and moving the goalposts does not change that.


    **Conclusion**


    - The decision here is simple. Let''s review the resolution propositions. Pro
    has the full burden of proof for three different claims. (1) The minimum wage
    is a bad thing, (2) The Minimum should not be raised, and (3) The Minimum wage
    should be abolished.


    * Has pro proven claim 1? No, he shows no evidence of this, he has not countered
    my evidence that the minimum wage is beneficial to the economy, and he has not
    countered the evidence that a gradual increase of wages in small increments over
    time does not negatively impact jobs.

    * Has pro proven claim 2? No, we have increased the minimum wage gradually and
    incrementally, and doing so on balance increases employment.

    * Has pro proven claim 3? No, there has been no refutation of the minimum wage
    economic benefits, and no evidence that the current existence of a minimum wage
    is harmful.

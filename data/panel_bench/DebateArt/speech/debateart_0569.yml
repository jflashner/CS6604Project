    **Definitions:**\

    Merriam-Webster offers two definitions for [never](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/never):
    **"not ever : at no time,"** and **"not in any degree : not under any condition."**\

    Anarcho-Capitalism is harder to define, but if anyone feels they need a primer,
    the first paragraph or two on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism)
    will do.

    As they were dealing with problems of eventualities, my second point concisely
    responded to the entire [Gish Gallop](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Gish_Gallop).


    **Precedents:**\

    If any lasted a greater amount of time than **"never,"** the resolution is negated.


    1. **Ireland (approx. 1000 years):** My point stands uncontested. Pro did provide
    a link, but the link was off topic (attempting to prove they did not live up to
    modern libertarian ideals, is different from implying they were not anarcho-capitalists).

    2. **Iceland (332 years):** I''ll grant that it was not a pure sample. However,
    the point of it was to exemplify a successful anarcho-capitalist legal system.

    3. **Rhode Island (12 years):** "It didn''t last very long" does not prove "never"
    as would be required by this debate resolution. Further, it did not [fall](https://www.warwickhistory.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=92:conimicut-village-and-its-environs-the-attack-on-shawomet&catid=42&Itemid=95)
    for any of pro''s listed reasons.

    4. **Albemartle (23 years):** I''ll grant that it was not a pure sample. While
    similar, it was libertarian instead of properly anarcho-capitalist.

    5. **Holy Experiment (9 years):** "It didn''t last very long" does not prove "never"
    as would be required by this debate resolution.


    I humbly drop the remaining two samples from my source.


    **Pure Rebuttals:**


    1. **"Protect The Environment":** Irrelevant to anything other than measuring
    if environmental protections work. China is the world''s [worst polluter](https://www.statista.com/chart/12211/the-countries-polluting-the-oceans-the-most/),
    but it works; not liking the way something works, is a far cry from showing that
    it does not work at all.

    2. **"Monopolies":** If they don''t work they won''t last (and are unlikely to
    form at all), so this point was in my favor without any need for refutation.

    3. **"Non-Aggression Principle":** Irrelevant as being nice is not required for
    a system to work.

    4. **"Property Rights":** People on average are not thieves and murderers; it
    does not take the presence of a state sponsored police officer to stop people
    from raiding and pillaging the local farmers market en mass. You see something
    you like at a friend''s house, they could probably not prove in court that you
    stole it, but it remains in their possession rather than yours. Thus the existence
    of private property does not rely on the government.

    5. **"Private Armed Thugs":** These exist in any system, and do not prevent them
    from working. As anyone who''s been to a dance-club or rock concert probably notes,
    it''s usually private rather than state issued protection. Were the state to do
    a perfect job on this, private security companies would not exist.

    6. **"Eventually... The One Percent":** While I could explain the flaws in the
    assumptions, pro has pre-refuted this point by insisting **"who owns what would
    be decided very often."**

    7. **"It Would End Up...":** Pro chose to insist that this (along with point #6)
    in no way indicate something did not work (R2, P2). That eventual failure is **"not
    even part of my argument"** converts this into a virtually a concession that something
    lasting long enough **"end up..."** means it worked.

    If a system collapses rapidly or leads to horrible results, did it "work" ? Enough
    with the word games, you are just trying to win without putting forth any effort.

    Actually you are a lazy, intellectually dishonest cretin looking for ways to reframe
    my arguments rather than dispute them.


    > If any lasted a greater amount of time than **"never,"** the resolution is negated.


    The resolution is that it will never work, not that if it''s attempted it will
    collapse immediately or fail to even get started. Debating you is pointless because
    you are a cheap pseudo-intellectual weasel trying to avoid having to actually
    win by debating.


    > My point stands uncontested. Pro did provide a link, but the link was off topic

    Celtic Ireland was tribal, and had "kings" according to the article I posted.
    Also, Anarcho-Capitalism is a form of extreme right wing libertarianism, rather
    than just "small government" they would eradicate the government entirely. That
    being said, the article was absolute over kill, because not only are they not
    Anarcho-Capitalists, they weren''t even Libertarian Capitalists.

    for any of pro''s listed reasons.


    It still had make-shift government functions, but I will grant it didn''t fall
    for the reasons I specified, but only because it never got the chance to. In smaller
    communities it can last a lot longer especially since they had outside support
    and they still technically were subject to Colonial Rhode Island law so it wasn''t
    lawless.


    > **Albemartle (23 years):** I''ll grant that it was not a pure sample. While

    "My point stands uncontested. Pro did provide a link, but the link was off topic

    You are a hypocritical and intellectually dishonest debater.


    > "It didn''t last very long" does not prove "never" as would be required by this

    the resolution is that astronauts will never make it to the moon, therefore if
    any rocket so much as exits the earths atmosphere the resolution is negated, even
    if it falls back to earth crashing and burning afterwards.


    > Irrelevant to anything other than measuring if environmental protections work.
    China is the world''s[worst polluter](https://www.statista.com/chart/12211/the-countries-polluting-the-oceans-the-most/),
    but it works; not liking the way something works, is a far cry from showing that
    it does not work at all.


    Any system that destroys the environment does not work, for the same reason that
    removing weeds by detonating a nuclear bomb in your garden does not work. Sure,
    the weeds are gone...but so is the garden.\

    Also for 99% of it''s citizens, China''s system does not work as they are living
    in abject poverty and slavery.


    > If they don''t work they won''t last (and are unlikely to form at all), so this
    point was in my favor without any need for refutation.


    Actually, no. A monopoly may "work" for a monopolist but it doesn''t work for
    society, which should be obvious. Also since the goal of Anarcho-Capitalism is
    a free market and to be free from institutional control over your life, and monopolies
    both inhibit free market activity and have power over people''s access to the
    means of production, it definitely does not work for Anarcho-Capitalism. The more
    monopoly there is the less Anarcho-Capitalist it is, because the free market is
    destroyed and the rich become the government.


    > Irrelevant as being nice is not required for a system to work.


    It''s not about being "nice", it''s about not murdering someone and stealing all
    their shit rather than engaging in free market activity because there is nothing
    to uphold law and order in an anarchic society.


    > People on average are not thieves and murderers; it does not take the presence
    of a state sponsored police officer to stop people from raiding and pillaging
    the local farmers market en mass. You see something you like at a friend''s house,
    they could probably not prove in court that you stole it, but it remains in their
    possession rather than yours. Thus the existence of private property does not
    rely on the government.


    If there was no law, then you would be able to get away with a lot more, thus
    many people would. In fact, so many people would, that it would cause others to
    resort to the same thing just to survive, and it would begin a vicious cycle of
    serial killing, serial looting shinanigans.


    > These exist in any system, and do not prevent them from working. As anyone who''s

    than state issued protection. Were the state to do a perfect job on this, private
    security companies would not exist.


    ONLY private ones would exist, and they would not be beholden to law but to whoever
    pays them. Private security agencies are still subject to law when there is a
    government.\

    This would cause the system to not work, because it would destroy the free market
    and turn anarchy into tyranny.


    > **"Eventually... The One Percent":** While I could explain the flaws in the

    The latter in no way refutes the former. You should probably not be smoking crack
    before you post in a debate.

    The way you debate makes me seriously wonder if you have a learning disability.

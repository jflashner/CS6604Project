    that any naturalistic explanation for a miracle claim is more probable than divine
    intervention.


    **The prior probability of miracles is low.** The laws of nature (physics, biology
    etc...) state that people stay dead, people cannot walk on water, and that people
    do not heal limbs. This puts a low prior probability to any miracle claim that
    says that people rise from the dead, walk on water, or heal limbs.\

    Since any Naturalistic explanation confirms to the laws of nature, it does not
    have a low prior probability.\

    **Daily Experience disconfirms miracles**\*\*.\*\* In our daily experience miracles
    don''t occur, so this is some evidence against miracles. In general, prayers for
    divine intervention are not answered, and The Divine doesn''t intervene on our
    lives.\

    While prayers of healing that come true (for example, with a flu) could be from
    divine intervention, a naturalistic explanation has a higher prior probability.\

    **Conclusion**The probability of miracles ever happening is low, which means one
    should not believe they occur

    him.


    To counter his opening claims, the very nature of a miracle means that it is scientifically
    unexplainable. This is the definition of a miracle put forth by the American Heritage
    Dictionary, 5th edition here:


    "An event that appears inexplicable by the laws of nature and so is held to be
    supernatural in origin or an act of God." \[1\]


    So to claim that a miracle is improbable because it violates the laws of nature
    is basically to assume the definition of a miracle is wrong.


    But, according to the debate rules, this does not matter anyways because all I
    have to do is prove that a single miracle is probable to have occurred. I do not
    have to prove it DID occur, or who made it occur, or even that it will occur again
    on command. I simply have to assert the probability that it occurred as probable.


    This being said, I shall open up with a verified news story of a boy who was dead
    for 45 minutes and then, after his mother prayed to God, was resurrected.


    The EMTs had been performing CPR on him for 27 minutes with no success. According
    to the news report, his pulse did not appear until after the prayer and his heart
    then restarted. \[2\]


    Dr. Garrett, who was one of the medical doctors presiding over the treatment,
    called the occurrence "a bonafide miracle." \[3\] \[4\]


    It also appears the kid has suffered minor brain injury.


    Now. Here is why this is a probable miracle:


    1. According to Medline, the U.S. Government''s official medical health resource
    for the general public, the brain dies after 5-6 minutes without oxygen. \[5\]
    The child was dead for 45 minutes, but was submerged in the icy water for 15 minutes.
    Yet now he is alive. This defies the medical consensus concerning brain death.


    2. After 10 minutes of a lack of oxygen, 80% of all people will go into a coma.
    Additionally, there will be permanent, sustained serious brain damage in the vast
    majority of cases where these people go into a coma. \[6\] The 14-year-old boy
    did not go into a coma and did not sustain severe permanent brain damage


    Considering the extremely unlikely survival of this boy considering the known
    medical science, and considering the fact his rising from the dead comes after
    a prayer, I think this qualifies as a probable miracle.

    **The News embellishes things**\

    The News embellishes things, and can be unrealible\

    News stories are known to embellish things, this is widely known. It could be
    that the boy''s heartbeat came back at around the same time as the mothers.


    Maybe he wasn''t clinically dead for 45 minutes.


    This could be true, and that is what I shall propose as my explanation. Side note
    that we are basing this off of a news story and not medical records. Side note,
    young people can survive up to 30 minutes under freezing water\[1\]


    Also, the news can flat out lie, just last month USA today emitted to fabricating
    23 journal articles. \[2\] \[3\]. (Note that USA today has emitted this and removed
    them) I don''t say this to attack USA today specifically, just to demonstrate
    that the news can be unreliable. Also note that Poylnter, one of my sources, is
    a fact checker, not news source.


    **Improbability of miracles**\

    Even though the explanation above is improbable, it''s still more probable than
    a miracle, which defies laws of physics and our daily experience.


    **Conclusion**\

    doesn''t break the laws of nature, or defy our daily experience.

    Is not a good bar of evidence. If we need sources for our sources, then we would
    have to provide an infinite series of sources. The explanation must end somewhere.


    Anyway, here''s a source \[1\] that says that the ''dive reflex'' found in mammals

    PRO has provided no evidence the USA Today article was fabricated and admitted
    his attack on USA Today was based on a generalization rather than the specifics
    of the article. Therefore, PRO has conceded the article is factual.


    PRO has also violated basic standards for burden of proof, instead claiming a
    source is an authority in and of itself, regardless of whether evidence has been
    put forth or not. This violates basic evidentiary standards \[1\] \[2\] and therefore
    erroneously claims a source does not need to provide proof of its assertions.


    Additionally, PRO has made a sweeping generalization that all sources are questionable,
    regardless of the type of evidence cited, upon citation alone, and has therefore
    reduced to absurdity \[3\] by using his source, which failed to provide any evidence
    for their claim, as a baseline for all sources and reduced the result to an absurd
    conclusion that all evidence is therefore questionable, regardless of the type
    of evidence presented.


    PRO has also claimed that any source cited is an Appeal to Authority, which violates
    the definition of an Authority in speech and debate, as per Merriam Webster''s
    Dictionary definition 4c:


    > "an individual cited or appealed to as an expert." \[7\]


    To assume a statement is true simply because an expert cites it, and not because
    the expert cited numerous forms of evidence and studies for their position, thereby
    satisfying the Burden of Proof requirement, is to Appeal to Authority. \[4\]


    My sources provided multiple citations for their assertions on brain damage, unlike
    the Umich article, which did not provide any evidence for their assertion, and
    thereby did not satisfy the Burden of Proof.


    PRO has also asserted I appealed to authority by citing a news story. This is
    erroneous. I cited a news story that satisfied the Burden of Proof. It provided
    witness testimony, the testimony of doctors and physicians, and therefore satisfies
    the Burden of Proof. I did not simply assert the news story was correct without
    evidence. I also provided other sources, including video interviews, that prove
    the article was factual.


    Ironically, PRO has claimed his Livescience article provides proof that the dive
    reflex keeps a child alive in icy water. The story sought to provide an explanation
    as to how a child can survive in icy water, using an example of a different teenager
    who survived 42 minutes under water, was then in a life-supported coma for one
    month, and woke up and seemed to be doing fine.


    Firstly, as I stated in my opening response, 80% of all people who go without
    oxygen for 10 minutes or more enter into a coma. \[5\] So the teenager''s story
    in Livescience is not unusual. Additionally, Livescience admits the boy was kept
    on life support until he woke up, which is vastly different from the story I cited
    of the child neither needing life support nor going into a coma. Additionally,
    the teenager would likely have died if removed from life support. This is because
    the purpose of life support is to keep a person alive until their body can do
    it on their own, as per the Cleveland Health Clinic:


    > "Life support refers to a variety of medical procedures that aim to keep you
    alive until your body is ready to take over again. " \[6\]


    So, essentially, the boy was artificially kept alive for one month, which is hardly
    a miracle.


    Additionally, the "dive reflex," according to PRO''s own article is not proven.
    Livescience explains:


    > "The first of these processes is known as the ''diving reflex,'' or bradycardic
    response, a physiological response that has been **observed most strongly in aquatic
    mammals**, but which is also **believed** to take place in humans." \[8\]


    The "believed" existence of the dive reflex has not been studied that much because
    there is significant risk of harming those involved in the study, as per Livescience:


    > "The diving reflex is often cited as the thing that saves people from nearly
    drowning. However, it''s difficult to study this reflex in humans (likely because
    of the **obvious dangers of recreating near-drowning experiences** in a lab),
    said Fallil. . ." \[8\]


    Based on these assertions and citations, the doctor cited in the article actually
    makes a case for the dangers of drowning in general and underscores why this is
    the reason the Bradycardic Response is not studied. He does not argue that the
    Beadycardic Response is a viable reason why all drowning victims survive. On the
    contrary, he claims that studying it would be quite dangerous to the people involved
    in the study.


    **CONCLUSION**


    PRO has so far failed to provide a logical, evidence-based reason as to why my
    verified news account of a boy who was dead for 45 minutes and then brought to
    life after prayer is not likely to be a miracle.


    The Livescience article PRO used to explain the survival did not prove the teenager
    referenced in the article survived because of the Bradycardic Response and also
    anecdotally proved the medical resources I cited correct on the occurrence of
    comas following a prolonged period without oxygen and the fact of being dead after
    prolonged exposure to lack of oxygen, since the teenager in PRO''s story was being
    kept alive by life support for one month.


    This differs greatly from the story I cited where there was no coma, no life support,
    and the child came back to life after prayer to God.


    In my story, the child defied the current known medical science, and therefore
    was a probable miracle. In PRO''s story, the teenager anecdotally proved it.

    This is correct. However, this does not stop it from being a possible explanation.\

    While the explanation is improbable, I must ask the voters which explanation is
    more likely, one that as little evidence, but is consistent with the laws of nature
    (mine) or one that has little evidence and but is not consistent with the laws
    of nature (CON''s)\

    Con says that there need to be sources for my sources, I have responded that the
    explanation must end somewhere. CON also claims I use the appeal to authority
    fallacy, however, he does as well (to a certain extent). The definition of the
    fallacy is this:\

    The appeal to authority fallacy, also known as argument from authority, is a type
    of logical fallacy that refers to the different ways of fallaciously using the
    statements or opinions of authority figures in order to support a conclusion.\[1\]\

    All CON has done is give expert opinions on the topic. CON says that there are
    studies backing him up, however, those studies are themselves appeals to authority,
    so the fallacy still holds.\

    Unless we want to deny scientific knowledge, we must go to the authorities of
    the relevant field (when we are not ourselves experts on them).

    It was an amazing opportunity to debate such a topic without either side resorting
    to trolling or emotional pleas. That is rare these days.\

    PRO claims he has no access to the primary source data. His claim is erroneous
    since the videos and articles provided have the doctors themselves testifying,
    the family testifying, and even interview the kid who was miraculously healed.
    These are primary sources. He has access to them. Claiming otherwise is either
    disingenuous or shows a lack of research ability.


    PRO also states that anything with sufficient evidence in it is likely to be true.
    He claims that Quantum Physics must be true because there is evidence.


    Based on his own admission, this means the miracle must have happened, and since
    PRO already agreed that, if this event happened, it would constitute as a probable
    miracle, PRO is forced to accept that a probable miracle took place. Just like
    in Quantum Mechanics, there is primary and secondary source materials proving
    the miracle event in question happened.


    If PRO decides to reject the evidence, without reason, due to fallacious thinking
    and sophistry, it does not change the fact that he admitted that anything with
    credible evidence is likely to have occurred and also his admission that the event
    would qualify as a miracle. Putting these two together, it is apparent PRO must
    agree a probable miracle took place.


    I will not beat a dead horse and reexplain how PRO''s position is circular logic.
    Since PRO did not provide justification or evidence that Naturalism prevents miracles
    from happening and he also did not explain how he did not engage in Circular Reasoning,
    my explanation still stands based on the standard burdens of proof I already cited.
    Since PRO failed to define the burden of proof laws, I am forced to supply definitions
    for them, which I did.


    Citing a source is not an appeal to authority. As the fallacy stands, it is arguing
    that the authority is right regardless of evidence. Both of our definitions make
    this plain. PRO is using equivocation \[1\] to try to discredit credible science
    to justify his grasping at straws.


    **CONCLUSION**


    PRO has not provided any evidence for his claims that Naturalism prevent miracles.
    PRO also asserted he agreed my event would count as a probable miracle, and he
    also said anything that goes against Naturalism with evidence behind it is accepted
    as probable.


    Therefore, PRO is forced to agree that a probable miracle took place.\

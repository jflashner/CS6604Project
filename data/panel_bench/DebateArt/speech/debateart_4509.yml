  content: 'As to try and keep this debate balanced, I will only answer pro''s question
    and elaborate on my reasoning in this speech.


    To answer my opponent''s question: I agree that it is commonly stated that 50%
    of marriages end in divorce. Depending on the country, this number may be more
    or less true. Calculating the international divorce rate presents a difficulty
    because of the lack of reliable data and record-keeping in many developing countries
    and because many countries make it incredibly difficult to attain a divorce even
    if a couple is divorced in all but name.


    **The actual percentage of marriages that end in divorce is irrelevant so long
    as I can prove that it is above 10%**, which it very clearly is in most countries
    and on average internationally\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_demography)\]\[[2](https://www.outlookmagazine.ca/family/divorce-rate-by-country-a-guide-to-marriage-and-divorce-statistics/)\]\[[3](https://wisevoter.com/country-rankings/divorce-rates-by-country/)\].
    **The only thing I must contend to win this debate is that the divorce rate is
    not below 10%**.


    Most countries with a relatively low divorce rate have several factors which should
    lead us to be skeptical (India, for example):


    1. Lack of accurate record-keeping.

    2. Incredibly difficult/impossible to obtain a divorce.

    3. Tax codes that favour married couples leading to couples remaining married
    only in-name.

    4. Social stigma.


    All of these factors give us good reason to believe that a very considerable portion
    of marriages in countries with low divorce rates (which almost always tend to
    be developing countries) are marriages only in-name. We can choose to define divorce
    in the legal sense (a marriage is legally annulled) or in the social sense (The
    couple no longer lives together, lives separate lives, seeks romance with a partner(s)
    outside the couple, etc...).


    **If a couple is divorced in the social sense but not in the legal sense, it is
    far more useful to consider them divorced** because their ''marriage'' is effectively
    meaningless. It is far more useful and accurate to consider them divorced. This
    is not even to speak on how any polling or record-keeping in developing countries
    largely neglects much larger rural populations for a multitude of reasons.


    For all of the reasons above I have mentioned, I have shown that most countries
    (which represent a majority of the world''s population) have a divorce rate considerably
    exceeding 10%, and that countries with lower divorce rates (which are almost always
    developing countries) have several factors which makes any data on their divorce
    rate unreliable.

  content: 'I appreciate pro''s handling of this debate in light of the fact that
    it was configured in a way that created a clash far too advantageous for con.
    Nonetheless, I will continue to debate the resolution **as it was written in the
    title and defined by the description**.


    **Does pro concede this debate is not regarding if the divorce rate is, as is
    commonly said, 50%?** If pro does not concede this, there are several reasons
    to see that the resolution implies as much:


    1. Were the resolution to be regarding both if the divorce rate is 50% and if
    the divorce rate is below 10%, **the resolution would be asking two questions,
    both of which are effectively the same**. This would make it impossible to judge.
    If I could prove the divorce rate is greater than 10% and my opponent proves the
    divorce rate is below 50%, who wins? Nobody. **A debate resolution has to have
    one goal-post, not two**.

    2. **Pro goes out of their way to specify exactly what pro is contending** (The
    divorce rate is below 10%). Logically, con is contending the exact opposite (The
    divorce rate is above 10%). **They did not say _"Pro is contending the divorce
    rate is below 10% and the commonly stated belief that half of marriages end in
    divorce is false."_ They mentioned the common saying and then completely separately
    asserted the primary contention of this debate**.


    Take the following example: If I say _"It is usually hot this time of year. Today
    it is cold, wouldn''t you agree?"_ **It is contextually obvious that I am beginning
    with a fact to justify why I bothered asking the question, and then the actual
    question that I want to discuss follows**. The question is not if you agree that
    it is usually hot this time of year.

    3\. The debate description states: _"The divorce rate in the USA is NOT 50%. It
    is actually much much lower."_ The argument is very clearly surrounding if it
    is, in fact, much, much lower (lower than 10%). Not if it is merely just not 50%.

    4\. **If the resolution were to be regarding if half of all marriages do end in
    divorce, the wording of the resolution is unavoidably misleading due to needless
    specificity**. Take the example of Lead-free cereal. If you saw a box of cereal
    that said "Lead-free," the implication is that previous/other cereals do, in fact,
    contain lead. For this reason, calling your cereal ''lead-free'', while true,
    is misleading.


    Similarly, **you cannot say "The divorce rate is not 50%. It''s below 10%." If
    you only want to have a debate on if the divorce rate is 50%. Needlessly specifying
    that it is, in your opinion, below 10% if that is irrelevant to the debate is,
    in this case, unavoidably misleading.**


    All of the above points serve to prove that the wording of the resolution makes
    it contextually obvious that the debate is regarding if and only if the divorce
    rate is below 10%.


    **I am not saying this to accuse pro of deliberately misleading me or any potential
    voters**, but simply to say that any way to argue that this resolution is both
    about if the divorce rate is 50% and if it is below 10% **inherently requires
    you argue the resolution is also hopelessly misleading**. If a resolution says
    one thing and you attempt to argue another thing, the resolution itself is solely
    what dictates the debate.


    Thereby, if the resolution is misleading (in the sense it says one thing and the
    instigator wants to debate another thing), the resolution must be judged based
    on what it says (if the divorce rate is below 10%) and not what the instigator
    wants to debate (if the divorce rate is 50% or not).


    Again, not saying pro is deliberately being misleading, just saying that the resolution
    cannot be referring to if the divorce rate is 50% or not without the resolution
    simultaneously being misleading.


    **My previous sources and arguments already unavoidably demonstrate that the divorce
    rate is above 10%**.


    1. The divorce rate in the USA (Number of couples married / number of couples
    divorced) is above 10% as my previous sources have proven.

    2. The divorce rate worldwide (same formula as previous point) is above 10% as
    my previous sources have proven.

    3. The median divorce rate country-by-country is above 10% (The number of countries
    with divorce rates below 10% does not constitute anywhere near a majority of the
    number of countries on Earth) as my previous sources have proven.


    Pro''s arguments do nothing to prove any of my evidence nor my claims to be faulty.
    Here''s a list of all occupations with a divorce rate greater than 50%\[[source](https://www.trapplegal.com/top-20-jobs-with-the-highest-divorce-rates/)\]:


    1. Gaming Manager - 52.9%

    2. Bartender - 52.7%

    3. Flight Attendant - 50.5%

    4. Gaming Service Workers - 50.3%

    5. Rolling Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders - 50.1%


    Con''s case is indisputably proven. Pro can not, in any convincing fashion, bring
    the debate to their side of the house.

  content: 'To reiterate the debate description:


    > _The divorce rate in the USA is NOT 50%. It is actually much much lower._


    Pro has done nothing to prove that it is ''much'' lower. My points from the previous
    round show you why it is contextually obvious what question the debate is asking.


    **It is impossible to debate two questions that are simultaneously the same**
    (if the divorce rate is 50% and if the divorce rate is below 10%) because that
    makes the debate impossible to judge because there''s two separate sets of goal
    posts.


    **Pro made their main contention clear in the title: That the divorce rate is
    below 10%**. Pro has unilaterally failed to prove that. **Pro concedes that the
    divorce rate is above 10%. It''s a truism that it is commonly said "50% of marriages
    end in divorce," but this fact** **has no relevance to the debate. It is merely
    a fact related to the central question.**


    After all this, what does pro have left? Nothing more than hiding behind the fact
    the divorce rate is below 50%. **Merely proving the divorce rate is below 50%
    is insufficient to meet pro''s burden as pro themselves outlined in the title
    and in the description** (that the divorce rate is ''much lower'' than 50%).


    Pro cites a source that says the divorce rate is 44% (though they critique the
    accuracy of the data, it nonetheless does not bode well for their ability to prove
    the divorce rate is ''much lower'' than 50%). Pro''s intention to discuss if the
    divorce rate will decrease below 10% in the future is irrelevant. That is a separate
    debate for a separate time.


    **Pro concedes the divorce rate is above 10%. The debate must have** **one benchmark
    by which it will be judged**\*\*, and it is contextually clear that 10% is the
    benchmark that this debate centres around whether or not pro flees behind the
    50% benchmark because it is impossible to argue that the divorce rate is below
    10%\*\*.


    Moreover, my opponent''s previous speech is particularly egregious in terms of
    the amount of content that is nothing more than direct quotations. The code of
    conduct has the following to say regarding plagiarism:


    > _"If credit is given and the copy/pasted sections are properly marked, it is
    not plagiarism. It may however fail to be a meritable argument for lack of analysis
    from the debater, even while doing fantastic on the sourcing. **An argument composed
    of more than 50% of quotes is not assured to cross this line but is in clear danger
    of it."**_


    While I am not accusing my opponent of plagiarism, let it serve as the final nail
    in the coffin to demonstrate why pro''s argument rests on indisputably shaky ground.
    To summarize:


    1. My point regarding needless specificity remains unrefuted. This argument cannot
    needlessly specify the 10% benchmark if it actually just wishes to discuss the
    common saying that 50% of marriages end in divorce.

    2. A debate can not have two separate sets of goal posts that are effectively
    the same (if the divorce rate is 50% and if the divorce rate is below 10%) because
    this makes it impossible to judge.

    3. My opponent concedes that the divorce rate is above 10%.

    4. My opponent has failed to prove the divorce rate is ''much lower'' than 50%.

    5. Even if my arguments do not convince you, pro merely restating their own arguments
    **without any analysis of what I said nor how their 3 main points relate to their
    ability to meet their burden of proof** does nothing to rebuke any of my points.

    6. Even if my opponent can convince you that this debate is both regarding the
    50% and 10% benchmarks, several of their arguments being mostly just quotes places
    the merit of those arguments on shaky ground.

    7. Even if my opponent can prove that their arguments stand up to scrutiny along
    with everything else, **This debate can, at absolute best, be brought to a draw
    where I can prove the divorce rate is above 10% and pro can prove it is below
    50%.** **A drawn debate favours con because of pro''s inability to meet their
    inherent burden of proof**.


    **This debate can, in its current state, ONLY be brought to a draw. There is no
    meaningful way for pro to bring the debate onto their side of the house**. The
    inherent burden of proof of the positive claim means **an objectively drawn debate
    would be a victory for con. This, combined with the fact it is impossible to view
    the debate as being both regarding if the divorce rate is 50% and also below 10%
    simultaneously without also seeing the wording of the debate as being needlessly
    specific and thus misleading (alongside pro''s potential CoC violation removing
    any merit from their arguments) means con must win this debate as it currently
    stands**.

    I must continue to debate the resolution as it was written. It certainly does
    not make me feel particularly great to be trying to definitively prove why I have
    won in this scenario, but I must do so.


    My arguments from the previous round prove definitively that, even in the best
    case scenario for pro, **this debate is an objective draw**. Since the positive
    claim has an inherent burden of proof, **this means con must win**. Tie votes
    are only reasonable in cases where pro has done slightly better than con, but
    due to the nature of their burden of proof, this means neither can win (tie votes
    are also acceptable in cases where it can be objectively demonstrated that neither
    side is correct). This fact is consistent with good practice on this site, actual
    debate guidelines for proper IRL debate tournaments, and basic logic.


    More than that, I have demonstrated why this debate **can''t be a draw** because
    of all the factors I have given showing that **even in the** **best** **interpretation
    of the resolution, my opponents arguments:**


    1. Have dubious merit due to being composed of mostly quotes (as per the CoC).

    2. Do not actually refute my points nor does any analysis on my position.

    3. Does not actually analyze how their 3 main positions relate to pro''s ability
    to meet their BoP.


    **Even more than that, I have shown that the more likely meaning of the resolution**
    (based on the wording of the resolution, the debate description, and context)
    **makes this an almost-truism for con**. The divorce rate is above 10% in every
    single meaningful, useful metric.


    For all these reasons and given that pro is unable to provide any actual defence
    against my critiques of their position nor any reason to doubt the truth of my
    claims, I do not see how any reasonable voter could interpret this debate as a
    pro victory.

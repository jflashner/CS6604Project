  content: 'I believe that human motivations for any action generally fall under 4
    different selfish motivations. I don''t believe that being selfish is bad. If
    Con would read _Anthem_ by Ayn Rand, that would be very obliging. It''s on the
    public domain and is a fairly short read.


    The 4 types are:


    1. Pleasure and Gain. (The Carrot) This is basically just greed. Having things
    makes you feels happy and motivates you to take actions that provide with more
    satisfaction in this regard.


    2. Pain Avoidance (The Stick). Self-preservation motivates you to avoid things
    that would cause you pain, such as not doing your chores if your parents support
    spankings. Pretty self-explanatory.


    3. Public Image. Motivations based upon how society views you. Why people are
    _much_ less likely to steal or do other things considered "bad" when in front
    of other people or are likely to get caught. Not because you care how it affects
    others, but how it will affect the way others act towards you.


    4. Moral Conceptions (or Self Image). You do things that you consider the "right"
    thing to do, not to serve others but to satisfy your morals. You believe that
    that is what you _should_ do, so it motivates you to do exactly that. This can
    overcome the three more obvious selfish actions if you have a strong enough conviction.

    This means that we are concerned with ourselves. If your point is true, those
    who have no sense of morals, like babies, should never exhibit any kind of altruism.
    However, we see babies being kind all the time. For example, one may share a toy
    with another. This fits nowhere in your paradigm. Because of this, it becomes
    much clearer that selfishness must be taught.


    What about situations that are in conflict with your view? For example, what if
    one should save someone being robbed, but it involves potentially being shot?
    That is in conflict with 2 and 4 of your model.


    Lastly, you''ve provided no proof that all human behavior falls within this model.

    Where''s your proof of this?

    That''s exactly what it is, a **HYPOTHESIS**. However, you have absolutely no
    evidence or data to back up your point. Without that, your hypothesis can''t stand,
    because it needs proof. Secondly, we are arguing whether human motivations are
    purely selfish or not, not whether your personal hypothesis is correct or not.
    You have yet to give any data towards your point. This is your argument:


    You: All actions are selfish.\

    Me: So helping someone across the street is selfish?\

    You: Yes, because it is satisfying one''s own morals.\

    Me: Where''s your proof that?\

    You: I said it, and you can''t provide an exception.\

    Me: What makes you an expert?\

    You: Me.\

    Me: *plugging in headphones*


    You''re using an argument from ignorance. Just because I can''t show an exception
    doesn''t mean that your position is right. You have absolutely no verifiable data,
    and until you do, you can''t prove your position and I win.

    1. Do your morals not tell you to help people? Do you not gain satisfaction from
    following your own morals? I do. Obviously, everyone''s thought processes could

    That was not made clear when you first made this. The nature of debate is that
    you make an argument and support it with evidence. Simply lumping all possibilities
    into a model that you claim is all "selfish" is not an argument.


    > You haven''t provided any evidence that what I''m saying **isn''t true**.


    It''s not my job to. You have the burden of proof and you are making the positive
    claim. Until you make an actual substantial argument, there is nothing to argue.


    > You haven''t provided any evidence of what a baby''s thought processes are.
    I have taken the actions that you listed and came up with possible explanations.


    You gave no evidence for those possible explanations. This is an analogy for your
    logic:


    Me: I see clouds, it must be about to rain.\

    You: A large gust of wind could possibly come in and blow those clouds away.\

    Me: Where''s your proof that that''s likely?\

    You: Can you prove what I''m saying isn''t true?\

    Me: No, but-\

    You: Then it doesn''t matter.\

    > And science does provide evidence that babies are not capable of advanced processes.
    At best, babies are likely just making arbitrary actions in curiosity to see what
    happens.


    You provided no evidence for this. In fact, I can cite evidence showing that babies
    DO show altruism. \[2\] \[3\] \[4\]


    > Animals have been proven to do this much, and several studies have shown similar
    intelligence levels between infant humans and certain animals like dogs. You haven''t
    even provided an alternate explanation.


    What do animals have to do with anything?

    Just because you get satisfaction from your morals doesn''t mean that following
    them is an act of selfishness. Actually, we get satisfaction from helping others.
    That''s not selfish.

    Confidence won''t win an argument. Evidence and real data will. I never said that
    you said that you''re an expert. I never put words into your mouth. I don''t have
    to be a greater authority in order to doubt you, all I have to do is provide a
    valid reason to doubt you. If someone told you they saw an alien, wouldn''t you
    doubt them until they showed evidence? But you don''t have the be a greater authority
    in order to do that. This is exactly the same situation.

    I am a FOOL.


    I don''t need to keep justifying myself to you.


    Ok, here''s the story. I search "human motivation" to look for what the current
    view is, only to find corroboration.


    Maslow''s Hierarchy of Needs.\[1\]


    In order of importance:


    **1. Biological and Physiological**\

    Food, homeostasis, sleep, shelter, etc.


    **2. Safety**\

    Routine, order, free of fear (physical and mental), etc.


    **3. Belongingness and Love**\

    Affection, part of a group, connectedness, friendship, partner or a spouse, etc.


    **4. Self-esteem**\

    Achievement, status, self-respect, respect of others, etc.


    **5. Self-actualization**\

    Self-confidence, reaching potential, self-fulfillment, etc.


    This all fits into my view, not perfectly, but enough.


    **Biological and Physiological**\

    Obviously, your own need for sleep, etc., is selfish. (I''ll take this opportunity
    to say once again that selfishness doesn''t constitute anything bad.)


    **Safety**\

    Once again, easily seen as selfish. The "need" to feel secure is a want, fitting
    in with #1 and #2 of my theory.


    **Self-esteem**\

    Fits with #3 and #4. How you view yourself and how others view you. Quite simple.


    **Self-actualization**\

    I''ll point out now how both #4 and #5 on Maslow''s Hierarchy literally put "self"
    in the title.\

    Fits further into #1. Get what you want, enjoy what you do, etc.


    **Alternatives**\

    Of course, you could argue against Maslow along with me. Just because it''s the
    commonly taught theory in schools doesn''t mean that it''s right. I''ll acknowledge
    that. But remember that Abraham Maslow was a psychologist who _did_ do research.


    On to alternate theories


    McClelland''s Human Motivation Theory \[2\]


    This describes three needs


    1. Need for Power

    2. Need for Achievement

    3. Need for Affiliation


    McClelland 1. Fits #1 (_my_ #1), and indirectly, #2. Power allows you to avoid
    things that you would otherwise not be able to.\

    McClelland 2. #1 and Self-actualization from Maslow.\

    McClelland 3. Fits #3 Social pressures, etc.


    Here''s a couple of other theories. You''re welcome to research these yourself.
    \[3\]


    **Instinct Theory**\

    I think we can both agree that humans are motivated by a lot more than instinct.


    **Incentive Theory**\

    An obvious mirror to my #1. Incomplete, but in the right direction.


    **Drive Theory**


    "According to the drive theory of motivation, people are motivated to take certain
    actions in order to reduce the internal tension that is caused by unmet needs.
    For example, you might be motivated to drink a glass of water in order to reduce
    the internal state of thirst."\[3\]\

    This fits pretty well with #2, although I''ll have to expand it to be more general,
    saying "avoidance of negative consequences" rather than "pain avoidance"


    That''s five theories, four of which corroborate my own. None contribute to your
    argument.

    I have no argument. My job is simply to rebut your points.


    **Selfish:** **lacking consideration for others; concerned chiefly with one''s
    own personal profit or pleasure.** \[1\]


    Maslow''s Hierarchy Of Needs:


    **Biological and Physiological**


    Things that go here are actions such as sleep. Actions such as these are not selfish
    because they do not make one lose consideration for others. You aren''t ignoring
    the needs of others when you go to sleep or eat (in normal situations). Selfishness
    is all about relativity and the person who you are putting down in order to have
    more concern for your own gain. There is no "other person" in this scenario, so
    this is not selfish behavior.


    The same goes for the rest of them. The only time it becomes selfish is when another
    person enters the scene. You may, for example, bully someone else because it''s
    cool and that helps your self-esteem. That''s selfish. However, dressing a certain
    way for one''s self-esteem is not selfish because nobody else suffers or is affected.


    This goes for all of the models you gave. Citing human motivations doesn''t prove
    that those motivations are selfish in any way.


    To summarize, I have shown clearly how none of the things my opponent has described
    are selfish unless another person enters the picture and his somehow harmed or
    negatively affected by the action. I have also given an exception to my opponent''s
    model (altruistic babies). Finally, my opponent never explained how all of the
    motivations he cited occur solely out of selfishness. The only way that he can
    win is if he proves that EVERY action is out of selfishness, and he has not. It
    is clear that I have sufficiently rebutted his arguments. Please vote Con.

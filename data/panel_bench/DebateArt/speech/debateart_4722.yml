    \ this debate because it is 100% certain that a plant based diet is superior to\
    \ a carnivorous diet.\u201D_\n\nBetter go easy on me then. ;)\n\n**Framework**\n\
    \nWell, as it currently stands. Pro is arguing that a plant based diet is superior\
    \ to a meat-based one. While I\u2019ll be arguing the reverse. How we will use\
    \ it to determine this by applying the following standards.:\n\n- Which is better\
    \ for functionality of health.\n- Which contributes to higher quality of life.\n\
    - Overall, which does more good for the economy.\n\nWe can do this by weighing\
    \ the overall pros for each category, where I shall conclude that on balance,\
    \ a meat-based diet serves a variety of purposes and contributes more benefits\
    \ than a plant-based one.\n\n**Carnivorous DNA**\n\nUnlike other primates, Evolution\
    \ did not intend for humans to be herbivorous and this is substantiated by our\
    \ anatomy, physiology, and biology. While hypothetically, a human could live on\
    \ the bare minimalist diet by only consuming fruits, vegetables, plants and nuts,\
    \ they would only be surviving.\n\nGorillas are able to live only by eating 45\
    \ pounds of vegetables a day and are super-lazy, yet they are known for their\
    \ muscular and powerful physiques. This naturally inspires a lot of people in\
    \ the fitness industry to assume they can achieve these results by imitating their\
    \ diet. But the critical difference is gorillas have a gut bacteria called [cellulase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/cellulase)\
    \ that allows them to digest vegetables in a way where their bodies can fully\
    \ absorb the nutrients and vitamins. Gorillas do not eat meat. [1](https://nedhardy.com/2020/03/27/how-do-gorillas-get-so-big-and-strong/)\n\
    \nThe reason why humans cannot achieve this is because we are designed differently\
    \ and lack the biological infrastructure and cellulase to absorb the cellulose,\
    \ nutrients & vitamins from vegetables.\\\nIf a human attempted to mimic a gorilla\u2019\
    s diet, they would end up bloated with severe diarrhea. Most of their weight would\
    \ be water and sodium weight. Far from being more nourished, since their bodies\
    \ can\u2019t absorb the vitamins, the constant bathroom visits would actually\
    \ cause them to become more malnourished.\n\n- Vegetarian primates tend to be\
    \ stronger and more muscular by default as their way of life because of genetics.\
    \ But they\u2019re also much lazier and live a more inert lifestyle.\n- Carnivorous\
    \ primates are hunter-gatherers and generally have to fight or kill for their\
    \ food.\n\nHumans have the genetic wiring of a mostly carnivorous primate.\n\n\
    _\u201CThe_ **_carnivore diet plan_** _is sort of an_[_evolution of paleo and\
    \ keto_](https://chomps.com/blogs/nutrition-sustainability-news/keto-carnivore-diet)_.\
    \ It stems from the contested belief that our ancestors ate mostly meat and fish,\
    \ and high-carb diets are why Americans and other western societies are experiencing\
    \ such high rates of chronic inflammation, disease, and gut issues.\u201D_\n\n\
    **The Economy**\n\nMuch of American society are consumers of meat. The Meat Industry\
    \ has supplied food nationally & globally, and given plenty of jobs to people\
    \ who would otherwise be unemployed.\\\nFor instance, the Meat Industry has given\
    \ 5.4 million jobs and over $260 billion wages.\\\nIt has been found that there\
    \ is more of a demand for meat than there are for vegetarian products. [1](https://www.meatinstitute.org/index.php?ht=d/sp/i/47465/pid/47465)\n\
    \nUsing this logic, we can infer that a carnivore diet is superior, economically\
    \ speaking, to a herbivore one on the basis that most people crave and desire\
    \ meat.\n\n**Nutritional Benefits & Risks**\n\n- Vegetarians have a higher risk\
    \ of stroke, statistics find.\n- A vegetarian diet is commonly linked to causing\
    \ nutritional deficiencies. [2](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/plant-based-diets-are-best-or-are-they-2019103118122)\n\
    \nControversy and medical wisdom suggests that a vegetarian diet leads to vitamin\
    \ B12, vitamin D, fatty acids, calcium, iron, and zinc. [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21139125/)\n\
    \nThis naturally leads to things like.:\n\nAnemia **-** Anemia is a condition\
    \ that develops when your blood produces a lower-than-normal amount of healthy\
    \ red blood cells. If you have anemia, your body does not get enough oxygen-rich\
    \ blood. The lack of oxygen can make you feel tired or weak. [4](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/anemia)\n\
    \nOsteoporosis **-** A medical condition in which the bones become brittle and\
    \ fragile from loss of tissue, typically as a result of hormonal changes, or deficiency\
    \ of calcium or vitamin D.\n\nBrain Fog **-** Brain fog is characterized by confusion,\
    \ forgetfulness, and a lack of focus and mental clarity. This can be caused by\
    \ overworking, lack of sleep, stress, and spending too much time on the computer.\
    \ [5](https://www.bangkokhospital.com/en/content/brain-fog-syndrome)\n\nExpenses\n\
    \nA vegan lifestyle is more expensive than a carnivorous one because the efforts\
    \ to combat the symptoms mentioned above generally mean paying more for multivitamins\
    \ and supplements that would otherwise be unnecessary on a meat diet.\n\nBenefits\
    \ of a Meat Diet\n\n- Leaner muscle tissue.\n- Clear-headedness and alertness.\n\
    - Strength.\n- More energy.\n- Less bone fractures.\n\n[6](https://www.premiofoods.com/the-health-benefits-of-eating-meat/)\n"

    or feelings.\

    Humans are highly superstitious animals, and it is actually the norm to be delusional
    in human societies. There very fabric of the average human mind consists of social
    constructs, subjective perceptions, and superstitions that we call beliefs and
    opinions. The scientific method was designed to ascertain object truths about
    the physical mechanics of reality (although it cannot ascertain the essence of
    reality, what something "is". Only it''s properties and behaviour). Even most
    scientists however do not think scientifically, a scientist is someone who uses
    science to achieve certain goals, but the majority of them still think like normal
    people in everyday life. A scientific thinker is someone who has no beliefs or
    opinions about reality, and only holds to speculation, inquiry, theory and proven
    facts. This is how everyone should be taught to think, because in our current
    state the average human is merely a vessel for the values, ideas,and opinions
    which it receives from it''s environment and conditioning, which it calls it''s
    "personal" values, ideas and opinions.

  content: '**General Refutation**


    The instigator states that belief is "useless in the pursuit of truth" and that
    a scientific thinker is "someone who has no beliefs or opinions about reality."
    The instigator has not provided us what his definition or meaning of the word
    "belief" is in this context but in epistemology, a belief is simply something
    that is held or accepted as true by a person\[1\]. In this sense, beliefs are
    a necessary component in any question for truth, as we must accept things as true
    (believe them) in order to build upon those beliefs and reach new heights.


    **Specific Refutation**


    Granting that, in this context, the instigator is referring specifically to beliefs
    that without factual basis, are assumed, or otherwise lack a solif foundation
    on which to establish truth. Even these are still required in any search for the
    truth.


    In making a deduction about available facts, the soundness of any conclusion depends
    on the validity of our initial premises. Our premises are themselves deduced from
    more basic premises or are assumed. If we discount any assumptions, then we can
    only have premises which have been deduced from other premises. This results in
    an infinite chain of logic argument without beginning, robbing us of the ability
    to even begin our quest for truth. We must start somewhere!


    Where we start are the assumptions and axioms of our system. They are present
    in all of the sciences and even in more "pure" areas such as mathematics and logic.
    Some basic assumptions in science\[2\]:


    - That cause and affect exists as all as natural phenomenon;

    - That our observations of past events can give us insight into future events;

    - The physical world is governed by laws which are consistent everywhere and throughout
    time;


    Without adopting _any_ beliefs whatsoever, we lack the ability to make any reasonable
    predictions of the future, and the grand adventure of science is ended before
    it can begin.


    **Point-by-Point Refutation**


    The instigator made a number of points in this Round. I present those points in
    quotes, and my response in italics.


    - "Humans are highly superstitious animals, and it is actually the norm to be
    delusional in human societies." - _Though irrelevant to the point at large, I
    will note that "delusions" are generally defined and identified by their abnormality._

    - "The scientific method was designed to ascertain object truths about the physical
    mechanics of reality" - _While I do not object to this simplification of the scientific
    method, I will note that its role in history runs counter to instigator''s argument.
    The modern scientific method was largely built upon the views and ideas of Karl
    Popper. While Popper eschewed the role of induction in science, he did not object
    to the use of beliefs in the pursuit of science. In fact, he embraced their use!
    Rather than eliminate beliefs (which he calls "conjectures") Popper provided a
    method by which we can choose among them. The goal was not the elimination of
    conjecture, but to criticize it and, through falsification and empirical testing,
    arrive at the one that best describes reality\[3\]_

    - "A scientific thinker is someone who has no beliefs or opinions about reality,
    and only holds to speculation, inquiry, theory and proven facts." - _I will note
    that the instigator offers no support for this definition of "scientific thinker."
    (Indeed, it is presented as instigator''s own opinion, which is ironic). Every
    person on Earth has held beliefs and opinions about reality (by any definition).
    We must then conclude that there are no "true" scientific thinkers, or perhaps
    this definition is incorrect. Given the purpose of such a definition as to classify
    something that exists in reality, we must discount this definition as flawed.
    Plenty of "scientific thinkers" throughout history have held beliefs or opinions
    about reality._


    **Summation**


    Beliefs, even those that are pure assumptions, are necessary in the search for
    truth. In addition to their necessity, there are immensely useful. I do not claim
    that they must be held without critical analysis, or never questioned, but rather
    it is through this process that we separate the wheat from the chaff. One has
    no use without the other and I challenge the instigator to provide any scientific
    fact, no matter how trivial, that is not rooted in some belief about the world.

  content: '**The instigator has not provided us what his definition or meaning of
    the word "belief"**\

    A belief in the context of my argument is something that you hold to be true,
    but which is not necessarily true. The implication is that it is illogical to
    hold something to be true unless you actually know it is true.\

    **in epistemology, a belief is simply something that is held or accepted as true
    by a person\[1\]. In this sense, beliefs are a necessary component in any question
    for truth,**\

    The problem with belief is that you do not need to know something to think it
    is true, therefor you are opening yourself up to be incorrect if you have beliefs
    rather than open inquiry and proven facts, especially if those beliefs are based
    on faith (AKA nothing).\

    **In making a deduction about available facts, the soundness of any conclusion
    depends on the validity of our initial premises. Our premises are themselves deduced
    from more basic premises or are assumed.**\

    Incorrect. This is where the open inquiry and speculation part come in. You don''t
    need to believe something to consider it, your ideas should consist of hypotheses,
    theory and fact rather than any form of assumption.**If we discount any assumptions,
    then we can only have premises which have been deduced from other premises. This
    results in an infinite chain of logic argument without beginning,**\

    The scientific method works a lot better when you postulate your hypothesis and
    then search for evidence rather than diving into your hypothesis from the top
    of the empire state building and hope it catches your fall. There is no need for
    assuming, only inquiring.


    **Some basic assumptions in science\[2\]:That cause and affect exists as all as
    natural phenomenon;**\

    Not only can you observe cause and effect in literally everything in the universe
    but it is logically impossible for everything that exists and happens to not be
    caused. If such where the case, then things can literally pop out of nothing,
    a unicorn could spontaneously essemble in your lap in a universe lacking cause
    and effect.**That our observations of past events can give us insight into future
    events;**\

    Given that cause and effect is inevitably a physical necessity, it goes without
    saying that past events influence future events, and therefor are relevant in
    their prediction.


    **The physical world is governed by laws which are consistent everywhere and throughout
    time;**\

    It''s actually been proven that the laws of physics aren''t consistent everywhere
    and throughout time. The known laws of physics break down in many cases such as
    with singularities and quantum entanglement.\

    **Without adopting any beliefs whatsoever, we lack the ability to make any reasonable
    predictions of the future, and the grand adventure of science is ended before
    it can begin.**\

    Entirely baseless and false. You do not need to believe in anything to form a
    hypothesis, you only need an idea and some information.\

    **Though irrelevant to the point at large, I will note that "delusions" are generally
    defined and identified by their abnormality.**\

    Firstly, it''s not irrelevant, the average human is both naturally inclined and
    encouraged by society to think in terms of personal beliefs and opinions rather
    than objectivity and methodology. Secondly, concluding that delusional notions
    are defined by their abnormality is assanine. Delusional notions are defined by
    their relationship to objective reality and if you think the majority of humans
    can''t be wrong about a lot of things then I don''t know how to help you other
    than to refer you to the nearest psychiatric ward.**While I do not object to this
    simplification of the scientific method, I will note that its role in history
    runs counter to instigator''s argument. The modern scientific method was largely
    built upon the views and ideas of Karl Popper. While Popper eschewed the role
    of induction in science, he did not object to the use of beliefs in the pursuit
    of science. In fact, he embraced their use! Rather than eliminate beliefs (which
    he calls "conjectures") Popper provided a method by which we can choose among
    them.**\

    You are missing the point of science if you think beliefs are a necessary part
    of the scientific method. These "conjectures" are merely postulations, guesses
    maybe, but not necessarily beliefs. Also the scientific method was built gradually
    and still has room for improvement, Karl Popper was significant to it''s formation
    but he did not lay it''s foundation or complete the development of it''s methodology.**I
    will note that the instigator offers no support for this definition of "scientific
    thinker." (Indeed, it is presented as instigator''s own opinion, which is ironic).**\

    There is no official definition for scientific thinker, the irony is entirely
    semantic. What I am referring to is someone who applies scientific standards to
    everything they allow themselves to accept as truth.


    **Every person on Earth has held beliefs and opinions about reality (by any definition).**\

    True, but that doesn''t make it the best way to think. I am thinking long term
    here, humans will not always be humans (provided we don''t go extinct before we
    reach type one civilisation status) and we will learn to think in entirely different
    ways. The first step towards that point is to change our culture globally and
    change the way people form ideas to make it impossible for them to be indoctrinated
    or programmed in the way they currently are by society.\

    **We must then conclude that there are no "true" scientific thinkers,**\

    It''s quite possible that this is the case. It is something that we must work
    towards through shifting the culture and changing the way successive generations
    are brought up.**Given the purpose of such a definition as to classify something
    that exists in reality, we must discount this definition as flawed. Plenty of
    "scientific thinkers" throughout history have held beliefs or opinions about reality.**\

    I must discount this statement as an abuse of semantics. I have already stated
    what I mean when I say scientific thinker.


    **Summation**\

    Pretty much everything you said was complete and utter bollocks, mate.

  content: '**Definition of Belief**


    My opponent has provided clarification regarding the use of the word "belief"
    in the context of this debate:


    > A belief in the context of my argument is something that you hold to be true,
    but which is not necessarily true.


    To which I addressed with my "Specific Refutation" in the previous round. To summarize:


    - Beliefs cannot be avoided;

    - Beliefs are necessary in order to build up to additional truths;


    **Beliefs Cannot be Avoided**


    My opponent response to this point was to concede that humans are predisposed
    towards belief, but argued that this was not the "best" way to think and then
    speculated that, at some unspecified point in the future, humans will undergo
    some unspecified metamorphosis that results in human beings thinking in different
    ways. My opponent offers no evidence that this is the case, nor presents any sort
    of reasoned argument. It is bare speculation and should be rejected by the reader.


    Additionally, the criteria of "the best way to think" is not what this debate
    is about. The debate, as presented originally, was that beliefs are useless and
    have no role in scientific thinking. It is this argument to which I am responding.
    If my opponent wishes to have a different debate, that will have to wait until
    this is one is over.


    Human beings naturally believe things. This is undisputed.


    **Beliefs are Necessary**


    I alluded to a famous problem regarding logic in my previous round. Arguments
    and reasoning cannot be purely deduced. They _necessarily_ rely on premises which
    are accepted as true, but axiomatically, not based on reasoning or justification.
    My opponent does not dispute that this dichotomy exists, but suggests that these
    premises are merely "considered" rather than "believed." While there are many
    cases where premises are accepted for the purposes of argumentation, the axioms
    that serve as the foundation of science, mathematics, and logic, are accepted
    - and believed - as true. To suggest they not be believed is to undermine the
    very foundation of the disciplines of knowledge upon which they are built.


    I presented (by way of example, and not as limitation) a series of axioms that
    are accepted in science. Of the first two (the existence of causation and its
    predictive qualities) my opponent simply states that they are not axioms, but
    provides no basis for accepting that claim. In contrast, I provided reference
    for these things _as assumptions_ rather than the results of reasoned argument
    or evidence.


    The third assumption, that of the consistency of physical laws, has let to a confusion.
    I did not mean to suggest that our human-made models are consistent everywhere
    and throughout time, but that the actual laws of physics, _whatever they may be_
    are what they are and are not different here, or there, now, or then, or in the
    future. Our approximations of these laws necessarily change as the accuracy of
    our observations change, upon which we refine our model to better reflect reality.


    **Conclusion**


    My opponent has made a number of bare assertions, without actual argument or external
    support. In other places, my opponent simply offers bare refutation and, failing
    that, insults. I submit that these bare assertions are not enough to counter my
    arguments, cited and supported, and encourage the reader to vote accordingly.

  content: '"My opponent response to this point was to concede that humans are predisposed
    towards belief, but argued that this was not the "best" way to think"\

    Belief is by definition inferior to knowledge and faith is by definition blind
    acceptance and therefore inferior to hypothesis and theory. The reason humans
    feel the need to "believe" in things is because they don''t know things and they
    are too much of a primitive gaggle of apes to admit it or realise it.


    "speculated that, at some unspecified point in the future, humans will undergo
    some unspecified metamorphosis that results in human beings thinking in different
    ways."\

    This is a fact, actually. If humans don''t go extinct or fall from civilisation
    somehow then we will inevitably evolve, implement biotechnology to guide our evolution,
    and develop new ways of thinking and ascertaining reality. On top of that even
    without anatomical changes to the brain humans have **always** developed new cultures
    and ways of thinking. Literally all of human history is proof that my statement
    is true, because humans constantly undergo change in their culture, values and
    thought processes over time.


    **Additionally, the criteria of "the best way to think" is not what this debate
    is about. The debate, as presented originally, was that beliefs are useless and
    have no role in scientific thinking.**\

    This is very relevant to the debate at hand, if you don''t see that then I really
    think you need to adjust your meds. The debate is primarily about what thought
    process is **best** for ascertaining objective truth. Scientific methodology has
    proven to be the most effective methodology known to man, and my argument is that
    superstition is useless AKA faith based beliefs.


    "Human beings naturally believe things. This is undisputed."\

    Then human beings naturally form useless neurological connections known as superstitions.
    Whether humans can be conditioned to think scientifically in a general sense is
    debatable, but that doesn''t even matter when it comes to whether beliefs are
    useless or not. Do men need nipples just because they have nipples?


    "the axioms that serve as the foundation of science, mathematics, and logic, are
    accepted - and believed - as true. To suggest they not be believed is to undermine
    the very foundation of the disciplines of knowledge upon which they are built."\

    There is a reason that almost nothing is actually called a "fact" in science,
    have you noticed that? The things you refer to mostly pertain to theory, and some
    of it is proven methodology. But nothing in science is merely assumed and believed,
    this is antithetical to science. Science is about making observations, forming
    ideas and testing those ideas, to blindly accept an idea before it is proven is
    the exact polar opposite of what science is supposed to do.


    "I presented (by way of example, and not as limitation) a series of axioms that
    are accepted in science. Of the first two (the existence of causation and its
    predictive qualities) my opponent simply states that they are not axioms, but
    provides no basis for accepting that claim. In contrast, I provided reference
    for these things as assumptions rather than the results of reasoned argument or
    evidence."\

    LOL. You literally just asserted that those things are assumptions but in actuality
    they are theories which are supported by evidence and logic. You debate in a deliberately
    deceptive manner, appealing to semantics, telling the opponent what their own
    statements mean and making assertions while claiming the opponent is making assertions
    when they are providing reasoned arguments.


    "My opponent has made a number of bare assertions, without actual argument or
    external support"\

    I had hoped that whoever excepted this debate would be scientifically literate
    and know the difference between a theory and an assumption instead of cherry picking
    definitions and not only taking Popper''s words out of context, but insinuating
    that he is the sole authority on the scientific method.


    "I submit that these bare assertions are not enough to counter my arguments, cited
    and supported, and encourage the reader to vote accordingly."\

    Oh come off it you soddy pillock, this is a philosophical debate not something
    that can be addressed with references and citations, especially when your citation
    consists of cherry picked definitions and arbitrarily deciding that Karl Popper
    is the sole authority on how to think scientifically.

  content: 'Claim\

    Pluto is not a planet


    Evidence\

    For an object to be classified as a planet, it has to meet the three criteria
    of the IAU (International Astronomical Union):


    1. It orbits the sun

    2. It has enough mass to form a nearly round shape

    3. It has "cleared the neighborhood" around its orbit (be big enough to be gravitationally
    dominant)


    Although Pluto meets the first two criteria, it does not meet the third and so
    is therefore not a planet. It is instead classified as a dwarf planet.


    The reason why Pluto was ever considered to be a full planet, is because before
    2006, there was no working definition of "planet" due to lack of scientific knowledge.


    Conclusion\

    Pluto is not a planet because it does not meet the three criteria of the IAU

    If I understand con''s arguments correctly, they are saying that:


    1. Pluto is a dwarf planet

    2. A dwarf planet is a planet

    3. Therefore, Pluto is a planet


    However, the definition of a dwarf planet, according to Oxford Languages (<https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en>),
    is "a celestial body resembling a small planet but lacking certain technical criteria
    that are required for it to be classed as such."


    According to this definition, a dwarf planet is not the same thing as a planet,
    and it does not follow through that Pluto is a planet.

    I **challenge** pro''s definition of a dwarf planet.


    According to NASA:\

    _"April 22, 2015. According to the International Astronomical Union, which sets
    definitions for planetary science, a dwarf planet is a celestial body that -orbits
    the sun, has enough mass to assume a nearly round shape, has not cleared the neighborhood
    around its orbit and is not a moon."_\

    ^^ All planets are celestial bodies.


    If Pluto was not a planet, would it be called dwarf? No, it''s called a dwarf
    **planet**.\

    We would categorize this into two different things, a planet has two different
    "settings":


    - Dwarf planet

    - Full-sized planet


    As well as the fact that Pluto meets all the criteria for a planet, the majority,
    just classified as a dwarf planet because it only lacks one thing.\

    For example, humans sometimes have no arms, which the majority of people have,
    but they are still humans.

    that he is not king of ALL of it, but he is indeed the primary ruler, having more
    power than Queen Sansa whom he is closely allied with to begin with and is essentially
    **allowing** to be independent despite the fact that he could take the north if
    he wanted to using the combined might of the other six kingdoms.

    \ I shall first show why that one is not Bran, and then show a couple of\ncandidates\
    \ who could be considered that singular person.\n\nC1. Bran is Unimportant\\\n\
    There is nothing to suggest Bran leads so much as one\nkingdom in Westeros (his\
    \ brother Robb would be next in line, should Ned lose\nhis head or anything),\
    \ let alone the whole continent. No big political events\neven stem from his encounter\
    \ with [wildlings](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Free_Folk) in episode\
    \ 6. Bran\u2019s events in in\nthe episode are summarized as follows (taken from\
    \ wiki):\n\n> \u201CAfter having another dream about\n> the Three-Eyed Raven,\
    \ Bran tries out his new saddle on a ride in the godswood\n> and is thrilled to\
    \ find that it works. While riding, he is attacked by wildlings led\n> by [Stiv](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Stiv).\n\
    > He tells them he is unable to get off the saddle due to the design of the\n\
    > straps, allowing them to see his crippled status. During the ambush, he is cut\n\
    > by [Wallen](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Wallen) on\n> his upper left\
    \ leg, allowing him to discover that he is immune to pain as well\n> as immobile.\
    \ Robb and [Theon\n> Greyjoy](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Theon_Greyjoy)\
    \ defend Bran, killing Stiv and the other wildlings apart\n> from [Osha](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Osha),\n\
    > who surrenders.\u201D\n\nC2. Littlefinger\u2019s Scheming\\\nPetyr Baelish (AKA\
    \ Littlefinger) is clearly up to no good.\nWhile his role in this episode is small,\
    \ I suspect he will prove to be secretly\nleading the seven kingdoms into war.\\\
    \nHis events in the episode are as follows (taken from wiki):\n\n> \u201CLittlefinger\
    \ is stunned when\n> Eddard orders that [Gregor Clegane](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Gregor_Clegane)\
    \ be arrested and executed for his\n> raids on the [Riverlands](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Riverlands)\
    \ and when he orders [Tywin Lannister](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Tywin_Lannister)\
    \ to present himself at court to\n> answer for his bannerman's crimes. Littlefinger\
    \ reminds Eddard that Tywin is\n> the richest man in Westeros and that it is gold\
    \ that wins wars, not armies.\n> Eddard disagrees, asking why Tywin is not the\
    \ king if this is the case.\u201D\n\nC3. Robert Baratheon is Lord of the Seven\
    \ Kingdoms\\\nI\u2019ll summarize his importance with a quote from him:\n\n> \u201C\
    Honor? I've got Seven Kingdoms to\n> rule! One king, Seven Kingdoms! Do you think\
    \ honor keeps them in line? Do you\n> think it's honor that's keeping the peace?\
    \ It's fear! Fear and blood!\u201D\n\nC4. Khal Drogo\\\nWhile not even in Westeros\
    \ during episode 6, his murder of the rightful heir to the Iron Throne is certainly\
    \ more important than anything involving Bran.\n"

    This is poor conduct and your personal unsubstantiated opinions about my debating
    tactics are irrelevant.


    Everything else you say is equally irrelevant because everyone knows that I am
    talking about season 8''s episode six. Brandon Stark is the ruler of westeros,
    and you just wasted way too much time listing information about an irrelevant
    episode from season 1.

  content: '**Definitions:**\

    Extend all, to include my prediction of Sparrow''s cheap semantic game, which
    he committed by attempting _without justification_ to [move the goalpost](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts)
    to episode 73 instead of episode 6.


    That multiple seasons have a 6th episode, does not change their overall number
    in the series. Were they each considered, it would just multiply Bran not leading
    Westeros a total of 8 times (as I proved in the rebuttal section, even in season
    8 he did not end up leading Westeros; a point Sparrow chose to drop).


    **Rebuttals:**\

    Extend all.


    Further, Sparrow has comedically proclaimed all information about season 8 to
    be "irrelevant," throwing out his own case and any hope of attaining his [Burden
    of Proof](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof).


    **Arguments:**\

    Extend all.

  content: 'The title of this debate is **Brandon Stark WILL be the one who leads
    Westeros at the end of episode 6.** The use of the word "will" implies that this
    is something that will happen in the future, not something which has already happened
    (and I created this debate before the resolution was actually confirmed with the
    coming of episode 6, and after the episode 6 Con is talking about.) It wouldn''t
    make much sense for me to be predicting something that happened in 2011 now would
    it? I am obviously talking about episode 6 of season 8, and grammatically and
    semantically this is the only interpretation that makes sense since season 8''s
    episode six is the only "episode 6" that "will" be happening relative to the time
    I made this debate.


    But even if you still want to press the issue, I have another way to dismantle
    your intellectual dishonesty. "Episode 6" can refer to episode 6 of any particular
    season, or to the sixth episode of all 73 episodes. The mere term "episode 6"
    can be used in more contexts than just one. In the context of episode six of season
    8 specifically, which fits under "episode six" just as well as any other episode
    six, whether it be a particular season or the whole series you''re referring to,
    Brandon Stark does indeed become King of Westeros, Therefore **In episode six,
    Brandon becomes the leader of westeros.** It doesn''t matter if in episode 6 of
    73 he doesn''t, or if in all the other seasons he doesn''t because just one "episode
    six" in which Brandon is King is enough for the resolution to be technically correct.


    You can pretend that I am talking about episode six of season one, or pretend
    that since in every other season''s episode 6 doesn''t have King Bran in it the
    obvious is refuted, but no matter how many ways you try to twist it the fact will
    remain...**In episode 6 of season eight, Bran becomes king, therefore it is perfectly,
    indisputably semantically and factually correct to say that Brandon Stark will
    be the one who leads Westeros at the end of episode six.**

    **Definition of Legislative**\

    Legislative is this debate is defined by the specific action that regard the policy
    at hand. This mean the law itself is being debated, not the general concept of
    abortion itself. While it could be used for an argument itself or a side point,
    it should not deter the conversation that is happening. It comes from a cause,
    effect side of a policy input. We are debating the law and itself


    **The Law Itself**A Basic Summary by: <https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-categorized-hundreds-of-abortion-restrictions-heres-why-the-anti-abortion-movement-is-escalating/>\

    "The Alabama law that was signed by the governor last week bans abortion in nearly
    all cases, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and carries up to a 99-year
    prison sentence for doctors who perform the procedure."


    **Definition of Abortion**The definition of abortion will defined in this debate
    as when a SPERM CELL comes in contact with the EGG to form a baby within the time
    it happens.\

    _The Arguments_


    **Introduction**\

    Alabama''s recent anti abortion bill has been the hot topic of many political
    news outlets and opened up the topic of policymakers and abortions. Millions of
    supporters gather to fight government for this bill, and demand a veto of the
    bill or to get it remove. Policymakers that are not the person carrying out the
    pregnancy or not apart of this debate have no right to determine whether or not
    someone should abort or not, forcing Christian beliefs upon non believers, therefore
    causing this bill to be inherently bad


    **I. Violates the Constitution**


    _Amendment 1:_ "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
    or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
    or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition
    the government for a redress of grievances."


    The law is a direct contrary to this belief of a freedom of religion and free
    exercise thereof. This means religion does not need to be exercised nor should
    be discriminated against. Abortion is an immoral flaw to most Christians and is
    against their religion to do as such. The law itself violates right to choose
    to be religion and strictly enforces religion on someone who may not identify
    themselves a religion persons. Many judicial officers have already determined
    the law in place by Alabama as "unconstitutional"(1) proving the accurate point
    that it is a violation of our constitutional right to abort or not abort. These
    bills threaten Roe v Wade, a constitutional judicial decision that states that
    there should be access to it, making it unconstitutional to outlaw abortion (2).
    It violates this amendment and has stood the test of time, it will do the same,
    and it will deemed unconstitutional


    We have a right to be free, and let us choose what we wan''t. If you believe abortion
    is murder, then the answer is to not go through with it. This will support the
    lassiez fair system of republicans have, and the freedom to control us is a constitutional
    right, therefore, the bill breaks this right


    **II. Implementing a 3rd world policy**America is one the highest regarded countries
    in the world, with modern technology and itself. The countries like Brazil, Benin,
    Sudan, and South Korea, among many others, outlaw abortion, but allow rape victims
    to end their pregnancies. Even these "pro-life" countries and states heavily favor
    abortion for rape(3). Rape is unholy be religion and it is outright disgusting
    itself. The policy implements this "3rd world law" into an increasingly progressive
    side. America should be role models to these nations, not deterring them in the
    wrong way. This long sentence determined would return us to scale one in our increasingly
    growing country. We need to regulate the actions of third world countries as many
    of their antics and tactics are American based


    **III. Rape goes against the Bible and religious sacriments**Regarding the religious
    philosophy, rape is considered an adulterous act, a sin in most Christian churches
    around the state of Alabama itself. If religion was the main motivator behind
    this bill, they would have accounted a deeper look into the 10 Commandments and
    looked at the view of these cases. Many religious Republicans like Mitt Romney
    even claim it is bad and is against it himself saying he''s pro life besides the
    3 major things (4). A conservative brained man like him should be able to feel
    the same religion and believe in religion himself, and for him to come out against
    the law, is a clear sign of knowledge of his sacraments.


    The president himself claimed pro-life besides the big 3 on his twitter as well
    (5). A bipartisan support of the removal is proof of how religion is the main
    motivator. Only true religious people would be against this bill, for rape and
    incest are HIGHLY against the bible. If the motive of the bill was to support
    the bible and religion, better teachings need to be done by Alabama. It seems
    they are not, as they rank 50th for Education and Child Living Space in the United
    States\

    I am awaiting my opponents response...

  content: '**Legality**\

    So we will be debating regarding the legalities instead of moralities. Understood.
    I feel as though you are running from the moral standpoint and the "general concept
    of abortion" just to make it easier on yourself. Ethics and morals have something
    to do with why legalities of abortions even exist. Slavery was legal when it shouldn''t
    have been. Same case should go with abortion.


    > "The Alabama law that was signed by the governor last week bans abortion in
    nearly all cases, with no exceptions for rape or incest, and carries up to a 99-year
    prison sentence for doctors who perform the procedure."


    With cases such as rape and incest, the mother can just give up the baby for adoption
    instead of resorting to end a life. Adoption would be a great solution. Let''s
    be real, most abortions are done out of convenience -- meaning consensual sex,
    knowing that they will get pregnant. With about 98% of abortions happening due
    to the fetus not being convenient, why should the mother''s convenience be elevated
    above the baby''s opportunity in life and to a full life? (1)


    > **Definition of Abortion**The definition of abortion will defined in this debate
    as when a SPERM CELL comes in contact with the EGG to form a baby within the time
    it happens.


    False. That''s the definition of conception. (2)


    **My argument - Why the Alabama law is legislatively right**\

    Simple. Scientifically, life begins at conception. A human zygote is formed. (3)
    Ending that life is immoral, so the law that Alabama has done is right.


    If the case that a woman''s health is at risk occurs, then an abortion does not
    have to be the only option to save a mother''s life. (4) Any treatment that is
    given to save a woman''s life that results in the death of an unborn child is
    not a true abortion, since the primary purpose of the treatment is to save a life,
    not take it. These cases are very rare; it is possible that a surgeon could delay
    treatment of the mother until the fetus reaches a certain stage of development
    where it is possible to save both lives. (5)


    Abortion inherently is not morally acceptable. It is a planned taking of a life,
    due to selfish and convenient reasons (most of the time). Therefore, it is not
    bio-ethical or ethical. Also, no moral principles seem to govern how, when, or
    why abortions are performed. This is why I think it should be considered unlawful
    because it defies ethics. Under ethical and moral reasons it is needless killing,
    and therefore should be considered murder under the law.


    I won''t include religion in my arguments. Await a response.

    **Responses**


    If we do simply math here, you point will be proven fallaciously stupid. In 2015,
    around 638k abortions are done per year in the USA and that numbers was increasing
    as many sources confirm. If only 2% of abortion cases are based om this, that
    means around 12,760 people that are raped and have abortions. While in the size
    of 638k, it may not seems big enough of a number to you, for a normal person without
    verifying via eye source, it would be a high number that would, and the number
    is still a 5 digit number, meaning that is happens and that is there to stay and
    the numbers will rise. 12k is a large number for a serious number.


    Many states do not have as flexible laws with adaption and such. After a pregnancy
    and such, it is considered the women must stay in the hospital for around 2 days
    before going and leaving. Some states where a Safehaven Policy occurs, you can
    give up that baby within 24hrs of birth. The most lenient state on this policy
    is Illinois, with a full month of this. But despite that, Illinois is a crippling
    state with huge sums of debt.


    Life would be hard, the child could be exposed to negative conditions, and develop
    anxiety, depression, etc. They are at a higher risk of all these negative effects,
    especially if the women itself is having these same thoughts. This is multiplied
    with rape


    **Definition**The act of having sex is not the life itself, it is creating it.
    It is as an embryo, which the stage of life, a cell itself. You define conception
    as the definition and that is not true. Conception is the act of making it. You
    can not make a cake and call the cake batter cake. It is not a cake itself. Since
    you used Merriam Webster, here: <https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/abortion>\

    -------------------------------------------------\_I. All of my round 1 arguments
    are left uncontested by the CON in the debate. This means that I should win these
    arguments and have full validation of them. There was no evidence of these arguments
    brought up, nor was there any countering of mine. I should be preferred over the
    CON, as the CON can not bring up arguments they missed in the debate in the rebuttals,
    as NO NEW arguments have been made. Here are my extensions for each one that should
    be guarded and protected and sealed until the end of round. No defense was added,
    and they give up the defense and my main points


    **Unconstitutional-** An unconstitutional law should not be in place and a law
    that violates an amendment should be repealed, and the new act meets all this
    criteria to be voided by the Supreme Court and the law forces a religion onto
    others, a CLEAR VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION\

    **3rd world policy-** A third world policy should not be in a country where we
    are currently progressions. Most countries have rules in place for rape, incest,
    and such. We are taking a step back in society, causing us to be a "joke" to other
    countries when we should be a role model for these countries\_\_\*\*Bible against
    rape-\*\*The bible was the main reason on why abortion was banned and these limits
    in place. The law is hypocritical to the Bible, as the bible is against adultery
    and such, therefore causing rape and violence to be against the bible, a bigger
    sin that is less debated\_


    _All arguments to be extended and preferred by a judge and to be weighed in when
    a vote is castes_\

    _-----------------------------------------------------------_\

    **Other Treatments?**


    > Simple. Scientifically, life begins at conception. A human zygote is formed.
    (3) Ending that life is immoral, so the law that Alabama has done is right.


    Read the counter definition and supporting why yours is blatantly wrong, I said
    in debate


    > If the case that a woman''s health is at risk occurs, then an abortion does
    not have to be the only option to save a mother''s life. (4) Any treatment that
    is given to save a woman''s life that results in the death of an unborn child
    is not a true abortion, since the primary purpose of the treatment is to save
    a life, not take it. These cases are very rare; it is possible that a surgeon
    could delay treatment of the mother until the fetus reaches a certain stage of
    development where it is possible to save both lives. (5)


    Are there any examples of this you could provide in the treatments


    These cases are EXTREMELY RARE, even rarer that a rape and incest with abortions
    as well. Treatment can not slow the birth of the baby down. It is physically acceptable


    > Abortion inherently is not morally acceptable. It is a planned taking of a life,
    due to selfish and convenient reasons (most of the time). Therefore, it is not
    bio-ethical or ethical. Also, no moral principles seem to govern how, when, or

    Technicality over Truth in this case. The technicality is that we have a right
    to choose what we do under the constitution and what we can do in the US. This
    violates the amendments made by our great founding fathers, and that technicality
    should outweigh any of your truth arguments that are mentioned in the debate as
    well. Even so, the truth is too, we have a freedom of religion, and this bill
    forces religion onto non believers, which you conveniently left uncontested

  content: '> _This is not a moral debate because this is a policy put into place

    I''m afraid the moral aspect has to come to play in this discussion. Again, you
    are running from that basic fact to try and make it easier for yourself. As I
    said before, the act of abortion defies ethics, which is the very reason why Alabama
    established that law, rightfully so. There''s nothing else to really talk about
    regarding the "cause" of abortion and the "effect" (law in Alabama). Cause = immoral,
    unethical, wrong. Effect = Abortion being illegal.


    > Life would be hard, the child could be exposed to negative conditions, and develop
    anxiety, depression, etc.


    Life is hard period. Do you know how many people have anxiety, depression and
    many other things? Do you think you should have gotten aborted to avoid experiencing
    stress and depression? Even celebrities grew up rough and experienced bad things
    from the beginning. No matter how successful you are, you are still human. Everyone
    has their moments. Now as for the "negative conditions" part, again the baby should
    just be adopted into a much better condition and live a better life.


    **Definition**\

    You are making this more difficult than it actually is.


    1. You stated the definition of conception (claiming it was abortion) when it
    is not abortion in which I debunked.

    2. You''re now saying "The act of sex is this" and this cake analogy and all of
    these other things unnecessarily. You aren''t rebutting anything I am saying,
    what you''re doing is saying random things and somehow interpreting what I said.
    I said conception means conception. You are the one with the misconception of
    the definition of it being "abortion"

    3. You have yet to even define abortion. Your link defines it, but it does not
    support your previous explanation.

    4. The definition of abortion is the termination of a pregnancy after, accompanied
    by, resulting in, or closely followed by the death of the embryo or fetus. Now
    that we got that established, let''s move on.


    Your points: l., ll., and lll. were disregarded for one simple reason, they were
    steering off topic. Majority of your arguments were based on religion in all three
    of your points. You don''t have to be a Christian to find abortion immoral. I''m
    sure Atheists find abortion immoral. Freedom of speech has nothing to do with,
    nor correlate with outlawing abortion. "Women''s rights" would have been more
    appropriate. Even so, the point of it all is to prevent killing. Would you support
    murder? If not, then why support abortion when a life is being taken?


    > _as NO NEW arguments have been made_


    False. I made my opening argument in the bottom half of my R1.


    > Read the counter definition and supporting why yours is blatantly wrong, I said
    in debate


    Rebutted.


    > Technicality over Truth in this case. The technicality is that we have a right
    to choose what we do under the constitution and what we can do in the US.


    Would you support murder being legal?


    > Even so, the truth is too, we have a freedom of religion, and this bill forces
    religion onto non believers, which you conveniently left uncontested.


    So are you religious or not? I can''t tell. Like I said earlier, even non believers
    who have common sense would find abortion immoral. I left it uncontested because
    as I said in my previous round, I will not use religion in my arguments.

    There is a difference between moral and legally. Moral debates to happen, but
    the primary focus of this debate was looking at this from a legal prespective,
    which was the topic of the debate. If you did not want to debate this legally,
    you did not have to. You turned this into a moral debate, going off topic of the
    primary topic of this. You should not whine and complain, and try to make the
    best out of an argument

    >

    > 1. You stated the definition of conception (claiming it was abortion) when it

    False. I did not say that. I said conception was the ACT of conceiving. The proccess
    and the start of the formation of cells is the formation of life, which is the
    perimeters of the debate

    THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU A RIGHT TO CONCEDE TO MY TOPICS PRESENTED!!! AND THAT IS
    NOT OFF-TOPIC IN ANYWAY, SHAPE, OR FORM! You conceded the arguments that it is
    unconstitutional. These are points that need to be answered in the debate and
    are disregarded and brush away. You should not take part in a debate if you can
    not accept the terms of legally and such. This is not a K debate, and you are
    forcing it as one.


    You also can not assume atheists are against abortion, you have to use factual
    evidence to support this claim. You have done none of these things

    Not to any of my points made in R1, which means you lose technically

    I support the ability to choose to practice a religion or once. Various people
    define abortion differently, so it could or could not be murder in this case depending

    who have common sense would find abortion immoral. I left it uncontested because

    You literally have no evidence to support this. I never talk about the IN DEPTH
    of religion, I specifically talk about freedom of practicing a RELIGION! I have
    not gone into the flaws of religion and such, a false assumption


    My opponent has based this rebuttal or assumptions and various degrees of lying
    and non responding to the 3 arguments I made in this debate that should be answered,
    while this is the last rebuttal before closing statements. The debate rules say
    that disregarded or conceded arguments are true. You can not just say bullshit

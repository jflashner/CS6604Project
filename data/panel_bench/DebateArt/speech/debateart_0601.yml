  content: 'Animal testing has proven to be uneffective and a complete waste of taxpayers
    money. Most of the time, the test performed on rats and other animals did not
    relate to human trials at all. In one dramatic case, a test worked perfectly on
    animals and was authorised for human testing. That test ended up with all of those
    people in hospital with emergency treatment.


    I propose an alternative. Instead of testing on animals, test on humans. If you
    want a product that works on humans, test a product on humans. The more dangerous
    products will be tested on death row inmates. If the product works, then that
    is a big leap forward for that product being distributed. If it failed, then nothing
    of high value was lost since that person was going to die anyway.

    on as per say rats and not on humans it would only be a small amount of people
    that it didn"t work and it"s only been a small handful that it hasn"t worked.
    Most animals they do testing on are rats and smaller animals which there organs
    and stuff work the same as us humans so most of the time when they want to do
    testing they do it on smaller animals which will work when they release it but
    they don"t release it after one test they do multiple test for months and months.


    With the fact you should test it on humans, The reason they don"t do it on humans
    because a person has to be willing to give it to them and people in the prison
    on death row might not have the current disease that they need for testing which
    if it"s import like cancer you want to make it quick to find a cure to that more
    people don"t die. If you have people on death row is takes years sometimes till
    they get killed so if they finally find a cure they won"t be able to test if it
    the guy doesn"t have cancer so it defeats the purpose.


    Therefore if they test if on rats and smaller animals they can see if it might
    work, Not to say it will it might then people who get the drug will have to sign
    a agreement saying there could be side effects during the testing and you could
    die but that"s where the animals come in so they at least know that yes in some
    cases it might not be safe but they can test it fries for months to make sure
    that should not cause any harm.

  content: 'It is not a small amount of people it did not work on, The tests done
    on rats and other animals failed to work on humans over 80% of the time. That
    means over 80% of research is wasted and the whole process starts again. Because
    of this, A large amount of money is also wasted because the research was completely
    useless.


    As for finding people to test on. Death row inmates can choose either the death
    penalty, Or human experimentation. They will be given a short explanation as to
    how the experiment can benefit society. Either way, They will die. However this
    system allows for the science industry to move forward significantly as they are
    able to test products a lot more accurately.


    When you stated that the reason they do not test on humans is because the human
    may not have the disease, The same goes for rats. The scientist gives the rat
    the disease, Then proceeds to perform experiments on that rat. For humans, The
    scientist would give the death row inmate the disease in order to start the experiment.
    Neither the rat or the human needs to already have the disease in order to begin
    an experiment.


    This new procedure may cost more, But the benefit of more accurate results would
    benefit society dramatically.

  content: 'For a start I would like I you to find the statistics for the first point
    that you made since most of the trials that get tested don"t work since they haven"t
    found the proper drug to work and would not be a large waste of money since if
    they end up finding a cure to cancer I don"t think testing on an animal would
    be as bad.


    Yes I understand that you can choose your death on death row and they have a choice
    on what they want done, But if we are looking at Australia you won"t be able to
    find anyone to kill or who will be willing to take it because we have lots of
    research labs in Australia but the only thing we can test it on is animals.


    But if the scientists gave the disease to an death row inmate then they would
    have to choose it they might not want to do it, Because as you said they have
    the right to choose what they want to get done.

  content: 'The statistics from my previous statement came from Steve Perrin. He wrote
    multiple articles about animal testing. A direct quote from one of his article
    reads, "more than 80% of potential therapeutics fail when tested in people. "


    The link for the article can be found here.\

    <https://www>.[nature.com/news/preclinical-research-make-mouse-studies-work-1.14913](http://nature.com/news/preclinical-research-make-mouse-studies-work-1.14913)


    He follows this stating that, "The series of clinical trials for a potential therapy
    can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. "


    The article clearly shows that hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on research
    when only 20% of that research can be used. 80% of those funds are simply washed
    away and wasted because rats are not humans.


    Who thought it would be a good idea to test on animals in order to get results
    on humans? Rats and humans are two completely different creatures. If you wanted
    to get results for humans, Test on humans. It is that simple.

  content: 'The reason you do testing on animals is because they have the same organ
    structure so most of the time when you test it on animals it works and yes they
    might not work all the time on humans but that"s why they can get it right the
    first time.


    Well most results come up the exact same just have different affects on different
    people in my opinion it"s fine to do testing on animals it"s only been done on
    rats and smaller animals with the same type of organs and blood as humans.

  content: 'There are a few classes that teach some basic law if you count learning
    the amendments in history, and debate, which is an elective that schools have
    that can sorta prepare you for lawyering.\

    I can only vouch for my personal experience in my own high school, but if there
    can be a class for "World of Conspiracy Theory," or "Equine Sciences," I think
    that there can be an elective for law. If schools already have this and I''m just
    unaware, then all the better.


    Roughly a third of college students change their major within three years and
    before getting a degree. \[1\] This means that money and scholarships are being
    wasted on courses that are never finished. I don''t have a specific statistic
    on law students, but the information is still relevant.\

    A prevalent reason for this is that high school graduates are not well informed
    about their major before they choose it.


    Law school is even worse. Because you have to go to a specific law school, rather
    than learn law at a normal college, there is no option of changing your major.
    Instead, you have to drop out. And the law school dropout rates range up into
    the 20%, though more expensive schools like Harvard necessarily have much lower
    rates. \[2\]


    The point is that too many students walk in blind and don''t like what they see.
    This is part of the reason for student loan debts, which affect 70% of college
    graduates. \[3\]


    A solution I propose is to more thoroughly inform high school students of their
    courses of study before they choose their major. I might be doing a debate about
    that later on.\

    A basic law elective class is a step in the right direction.

  content: 'I would argue that a basic knowledge of the law and its proceedings should
    be taught as a mandatory thing for a quarter or two. It is the duty of American
    citizens to be informed about the process of government, and the judicial branch
    is part of this.


    In addition, it is inevitable that you would go into court for something or other,
    be it a traffic violation, speeding ticket, DUI, or a criminal charge. Knowing
    how to conduct yourself and how the case/verdict will happen will be helpful in
    the long run, especially if you know your rights. Or if you''re a model citizen
    or have mandatory jury duty, it is still crucial to know how the law operates
    in enforcement and on a court scale.


    Government classes are often taught, and it is mandatory for the school I attend.
    But the classes don''t focus as heavily on the Supreme Court and lower courts
    as it does the legislative and executive branch. Everyone focuses on the President
    when, in fact, the Supreme Court has just as much influence.


    Examples:


    - _Plessy v. Ferguson_ (1896), which began the "separate but equal" doctrine

    - _Roe v. Wade_ (1973), establishing that right to privacy extends to abortions

    - _Tinker v. Des Moines_ (1969), asserting that students have free speech in schools

    - _Marbury v. Madison_ (1803), extending the Supreme Court''s power


    In my opinion, having a good knowledge of the law is imperative in being a good
    American citizen. It is the obligation of the American citizens to know about
    the government, on a small and large scale.

  content: 'Ah. You''re saying that a basic law should be required, not an elective.


    Well, at my school, there are required credits, such as P.E. and Health that you
    have to take, even though they''re "electives."


    This is different from math, English, science, and history because they''re not
    "Core Classes."


    I don''t oppose law as a required "elective." I was only thinking about preparing
    for law school when I made this debate, but it also makes sense that a degree
    of legal understanding is part of having good citizenship.


    So I think that law should be a required elective. I know that in my description
    that I said "Not that it should be required," but I wasn''t considering normal
    obligations in court.


    I might also propose the law class being put under the same credit as Government
    classes so that students can pick between the two, but really they should take
    both.

    or have mandatory jury duty, it is still crucial to know how the law operates
    in enforcement and on a court scale." I meant "Even if" for the model citizen
    comment and I apologize if it was unclear. Continuing.


    1. I would not say that the Government and law classes should be interchangeable,
    as they focus on different things. I''d also state that Government and law would
    be "core classes", because, once again, it is the duty of the American citizen
    to know about their government and the due process of law, as well as their rights
    (see [here](https://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_resp.html), apologies for
    the website format).

    2. Instead of teaching us about the mitochondria for the 17th time in a row, we
    could learn something useful if the law class is obligatory. (I''m dead serious
    about this, there is too much reviewing of material.)

    3. Required credits can take place over any year. For example, at my school, it
    is required we have at least one P.E. credit in order to graduate. But if you
    have a class that takes place over a quarter in a certain year, like Health in
    junior, it could make things much smoother.

    I was only suggesting that they might implement it that way. Other classes have
    been like that at my school, like taking a foreign language and Journalism each
    counted as a Communications credit. It wasn''t personally something I supported.


    2.


    Fair point, but perhaps a question for another debate.


    3.


    Fair and relevant.\

    But they call them Core Classes because you take them every year. Science, history,
    English, and math.\

    It would still be considered a required elective because it wouldn''t do that.
    It would be like health: important knowledge, but not something you need to spend
    four years on.

    2. True, but it''s something that needs to be talked about anyway.


    3. I accept your point.


    I would like to point out that if you''re making the decision to go to law school,
    then it would be in your best interest to research law. I personally want to become
    a CTI in the Navy and get a Ph.D. in ornithology (the study of birds, hence my
    profile picture) so I can be a falconer. In order to completely see all my options,
    I''ve got to research. See what the requirements are. Besides, there are no classes
    for the foreign language I want to learn (Russian). There''s no class exclusively
    about birds. Sometimes schools don''t provide all the options. So find them yourself.

  content: 'Methodism is a denomination of Christianity that teaches the principle
    of entire sanctification. Every other form of Christianity is half-assed compared
    to Methodism because they believe in a Jesus that will save just anybody instead
    of the Jesus that said "many are called but few are chosen" and "be perfect as
    your father in heaven is perfect". Methodism is the ultimate religion morally
    because it requires you to actually be like Jesus unlike the half-assed hypocrites
    that call themselves Christians the majority of the time. Being like Jesus means
    (according to the Bible) that you do unto others as you would have done to you
    if in their shoes, that you are not a judgmental person and that you surrender
    your will to the will of God which means to prioritize being rich in virtue above
    being rich in a worldy sense. The book of proverbs teaches you how to be rich
    in both a worldy sense and a virtuous sense which means you don''t have to sacrifice
    one for the other making it not only the ultimate religion morally but materialistically.

  content: 'Methodism VS any other religion or denomination.


    I guess the point of the topic is to just compare facets and elements and we go
    from there with questions and statements.


    I want to use some biblical scripture to open up my introduction to what I''m
    saying.


    The topic mentions "any other religion". So I''m taking the word religion synonymous
    with faith.


    So it''s Methodism versus any other religion/faith.


    JUDE 1:20


    "But you, dear friends, by building yourselves up in your most holy faith"


    A holy faith or a holy religion ok.


    Now where do we find what this holy faith is all about?


    2 Corinthians 4


    13" We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed,
    and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak"


    So the faith has been written about.


    So it''s Methodism versus what the bible says. What is believed is what will be
    said.


    "Every other form of Christianity is half-assed compared to Methodism because
    they believe in a Jesus that will save just anybody instead of the Jesus that
    said "many are called but few are chosen" and "be perfect as your father in heaven
    is perfect".


    Now this is scriptural what''s in quotes. However the scripture doesn''t call
    any such faith , the faith of methodism.


    That can be a name people can choose to call the faith written in scripture. It
    can be problematic.


    But so far we both may happen to be on the same page as far as religions. Different
    denominations that are made up or invented by sector founders manufacture their
    own doctrine, guidelines, METHODS, ceremonies, customs that begin to blurry what
    is acceptable, unacceptable, satisfactory , unsatisfactory, fulfilling, unfaithful
    and faithful .


    In what you described I would say the bible puts it as lukewarm. There''s no place
    for half-heartedness or being lukewarm in holiness.


    "Methodism is the ultimate religion morally because it requires you to actually
    be like Jesus unlike the half-assed hypocrites that call themselves Christians
    the majority of the time. "


    The scripture doesn''t even teach such a religion called Christianity. I understand
    there are those that deny themselves to follow Christ and that''s what someone
    may call those that follow Christ Christians.


    But the title Christian much like the title Christianity is used to blanket a
    homogenization of things blurring the lines once again.


    To be halfway perfect by halfway doings things is not it. Scripture doesn''t say
    halfway doer but a doer of the word.


    "Being like Jesus means (according to the Bible)"


    Believe on him as the scripture have said. It''s all in there. All having the
    same spirit of faith according to as it is written. Amen.


    Therefore what''s with all the denominations?


    It''s the same spirit of faith.


    "that you are not a judgmental"


    Well let us not blanket this. It''s in the book to judge righteous.


    So wherever you want to go from here I don''t know. It''s look like we''re both
    on the same page.

  content: 'Con hasn''t even chosen a religion or denomination to defend. Instead
    he is siding with "Bible" which the logical conclusion of is methodism because
    Jesus wants you to follow him completely, which means working towards entire sanctification.


    > So wherever you want to go from here I don''t know. It''s look like we''re both
    on the same page.


    Is this a concession?


    If not I challenge Con to bring forward any Bible passage which debunks the idea
    of entire sanctification. Even if the Bible said something like "only God and
    Jesus can be entirely sanctified" it doesn''t change the fact that Jesus clearly
    wants you to aim for being like him, which again means doing your best to rid
    yourself of sin and be "perfect".

    \ Are you just bringing up things to try to debate on?\n\nIf we just happen to\
    \ come to agreement, it is what it is. With a topic as broad as this \"Methodism\

    \ here. I'm doing so and perhaps this is why you're not engaging. I believe this\

    \ I had a rebuttal for.\n\nAnother rebuttal is for you making the statement of\

    \ we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which\
    \ God prepared in advance for us to do.\"\n\nWhere are you getting this \"do your\
    \ best\" stuff from?\n\nI guess that's methodism. It's not holiness.\n\nNot of\
    \ you, not of works to your very best. Not of your best handiwork created to do\
    \ good works that you yourself prepared in advance for you to do. In another translation,\
    \ ordained in advance.\n\n\"13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away\
    \ have been brought near by the blood of Christ.\"\n\nTies into 1 John 1 so there\
    \ is no boast about doing the \"best you can\".\n\nWhich brings in this conflict.\
    \ Doing your best as you say doesn't necessarily translate being perfect. It's\
    \ just the best you can do.\n\nSo you're trying to make a point about not being\

    \ says a double minded man is unstable. Your position is unstable and inconsistent.\n\
    \n1 Peter 2:8\n\n\"And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, _even to them_\
    \ which stumble at the word\"\n\nYou stumble, you've gone wrong at the word, you\
    \ can't be obedient to. You talk being like Jesus. Be perfect that's correct.\n\
    \nWe read in James 3:2\n\n\"For we all stumble in many things. If anyone does\
    \ not stumble in word, he _is_ a perfect man.\"\n\nYou stumble and have gone wrong\
    \ in your position not being correct in the word of the scriptures.\n"

    \ you stand guilty of going beyond what is WRITTEN .\n\nNow I'm going to answer\
    \ the question \"What does having faith cause you to do?\" with what is written.\\\
    \nAnything else would be adding words such as the word \"Methodism\".\n\n1 Thessalonians\
    \ 2\n\n\"13And we also thank God continually because, when you received the word\
    \ of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human word, but as\
    \ it actually is, the word of God, which is indeed at work in you who believe.\
    \ \"\n\nOh so your belief allows you to accept the word of God. I hear the scripture\
    \ saying \"faith cometh by hearing the word of God\". Then from there the word\
    \ working in you that believe.\n\nLet's have some context here for exposition.\n\
    \nBack up to verse 10.\n\n\"10 You are witnesses, and so is God, of how holy,\
    \ righteous and blameless we were among you who believed. 11 For you know that\
    \ we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, 12 encouraging,\
    \ comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his\
    \ kingdom and glory.\"\n\nThis is our theme isn't? Holy and righteous, lives worthy\
    \ of God. Not Methodist and righteous but holy.\\\nLet's harmonize 1 Thessalonians\
    \ 2 with Philippians 2.\n\nAt verse 13\\\n\"For it is God which worketh in you\
    \ both to will and to do of his good pleasure.\"\n\nWe know from John 1 the Word\
    \ was God.\n\n\"For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his\
    \ good pleasure.\"\n\nThis again kills your\"try your best\" , \"do your best\"\
    \ mess .\n\nScripture says out of Ezekiel \"And I will put my Spirit in you and\
    \ move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws.\"\n\nWe just took\
    \ a long way around to come right back to what I gave the previous round about\
    \ God ordaining good works in advance for you to do.\n\nMatter of fact if you're\
    \ actually reading what I put, you already got the answer to the question from\
    \ Ephesians 2.\n\nEphesians 2\n\n\"8 For it is by grace you have been saved, through\
    \ faith\"\n\nYou having faith will get you saving grace .\n\nNow this is where\
    \ you error thinking it's you made up in your mind to believe .\n\n\"\u2014and\
    \ this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God\"\n\nDon't forget that part.\n\
    \nNow we just went over the other passages that told us what is in work in you.\n\
    \nLook at this .\n\n\" 10 For we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus\
    \ to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\"\n\nWhat's in\
    \ work in you predestinated or prepared in advance the good works for you to do.\n\
    \nAll just through having faith.\n\n\"This doesn't mean not to do your best to\
    \ be a good Christian, it means to give credit to God for your ability to do good.\
    \ \"\n\n\" God prepared in advance for us to do.\"\n\nYou're reading that as we\
    \ do the work of ourselves that God has prepared for us to do. Created in Christ\
    \ to do works God prepared for us to do. What does that mean? **It didn't say\
    \ of ourselves do good works.** It was created in us to do good works. Does it\
    \ mean we do the work of ourselves that God has established or do the work not\
    \ of ourselves because God is in work or at work in us to do the work?\n\nThe\
    \ answer is the latter based on Philippians 2 and 1 Thessalonians 2, not to mention\
    \ Ezekiel.\n\nThis is why we read line upon line of the scriptures, here a little,\
    \ there a little. That's why you came to error in your interpretation of Ephesians\
    \ 2. You error not knowing the scriptures.\n\nEither way , you being prepared\
    \ by God , your so called best has nothing to do with it. You were prepared by\
    \ God, not prepared by yourself. By yourself it's all on you and you can call\
    \ it your best which mostly will be half-hearted. A contradiction in your own\
    \ position.\n\nScripture says of yourselves you can do nothing. But Christ the\
    \ true vine, you can do all things who strengthens you.\n\nIt's because of your\
    \ bias you read Ephesians 2 as works of yourselves. It says \" not of works\"\
    , \" not of yourselves\". We just read \"not of yourselves\". That was just read.\n\
    \nThis is what having your own religion does. Which you call methodism. Scripture\
    \ says beware of philosophy, traditions(customs)of men after the rudiments of\
    \ the world, and not after Christ. You may have your own commandments that of\
    \ man, not of Christ.\n\nJames 1:26\n\nFor people coming up with their own religions,\
    \ Methodism, Presbyterian, Martin Lutheran, any of these man made denominations,\
    \ religions, etc.\n\n\"If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth\
    \ not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.\"\n\
    \nYou are deceived when not in truth. Not in Christ is not being in truth because\
    \ He is the truth.\n\nAmen.\n"

    \n_Wokeness:_ **a state of being aware, especially of social problems such as\
    \ racism and inequality**\\\n[Cambridge Dictionary](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=09326a66fb1c9f8bJmltdHM9MTY2MDU1NTIzNyZpZ3VpZD03NTQ0YjZhOC1jMjI5LTQ5ZmMtYTA1ZC02Y2YzNDM5MTExOTEmaW5zaWQ9NTIxMA&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=8615e030-1c7b-11ed-a35e-368eac48ca30&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9kaWN0aW9uYXJ5LmNhbWJyaWRnZS5vcmcvZGljdGlvbmFyeS9lbmdsaXNoL3dva2VuZXNz&ntb=1)\n\
    \nThere has been no disputes nor limitations over what religions ought to be considered,\
    \ so what Pro is trying to say is that:\n\n> All religions should be accepted\
    \ as a reason to disagree with awareness of social issues.\n\n**Christianity**\n\
    \nPro just used 1 example from 1 religion(Christianity) to support his view.\\\
    \nI will give counterexamples for this religions, using more than 1 quote.\n\n\
    Wealth Equity\n\n> [Proverbs 22:2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+22%3A2&version=ESV)\

    \ There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no\

    > [1 Corinthians 12:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+12%3A13&version=ESV)\
    \ For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body\u2014Jews or Greeks, slaves\

    \ You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you,\
    \ and you shall love him as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt:\

    \ ([Ephesians 2:14](https://www.biblestudytools.com/ephesians/2-14.html)).\n\n\
    I don't know the average stance of the Bible, but if Pro can use 1 quote to illustrate\
    \ the non-wokeness, I can, with several paying attention to social problems such\
    \ as racism and other inequalities here.\n\n**Re: Christianity**\n\n> The bible\
    \ says that being gay is not allowed (1 Corinthians 6:9\u201310)\n\nNo, it states\
    \ that lust, even if done by two men, are sinful. The bible quotes never discriminate\
    \ against just sexual orientations, in fact, [sexual orientation wasn't even a\
    \ clear idea in the time the scripture was written, layered on top with ambiguous\
    \ translations](https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-homosexuality).\
    \ In all seriousness, not being gay was the majority and the social norm, and\
    \ there was no idea of gay marriage, so at the moment just being gay could be\
    \ interpreted as the same thing as lust if any action was done.\n\nIn conclusion:\
    \ Pro needs more evidence than that.\\\n**Other Religions**\n\n[Buddhism](https://buddhismzone.org/the-effects-of-buddhism-in-the-society/#:~:text=The%20Effects%20Of%20Buddhism%20In%20The%20Society%201,8%20Impact%20on%20great%20Personality%20...%20More%20items)\

    \ but right now this is enough.\n\n**Conclusions**\n\n- Christian scripture have\
    \ quotes that promote wokeness, and Pro's example of anti-wokeness is not enough.\n\
    - Other religion have their attention on equality and social issues, which are\
    \ not ruled out.\n- As a result, religion as a macro-concept should not on its\
    \ own be a reason against wokeness because some of them actually promote wokeness\

  content: 'k number 1, sorry to not elaborate but as a Christian (and not any other
    religion) so i will be responding to the points about the Bible etc and not the
    other religions\

    2\. as for the proverbs quote, there is a reason why the old testament is called
    the old testament, adn the new testament new. The old testament was written by
    God through people, for the **Israelites** at the time. So it is not relevant.


    As u said with the galatians quote, it is **general.** probably during the time
    it was more directed to the gentiles since they were discriminated by the Jews
    and vice versa. And women were also forced to stay at home and not get any education
    and was most likely not allowed to be a person who is of importance to early christianity
    and Paul the Apostle (who wrote this epistle) most likely targeted it at that.
    (i wasnt there, wouldnt know)


    as for the part with verses against racism, i do not disagree, it is correct.


    As for the response to 1 Corinthinas 6:9, 9-10 "Or do you not know that wrongdoers
    will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually
    immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men" The words
    men ''who have sex with other men'' translate two greek words refer to the passive
    and active participants in homosexual acts.


    And saying that it could be intrepreted as the same thing as lust if any action
    was done is not true since it is evil in the eyes of the Lord. according to Romans
    1:26-27 " \_Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their
    women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men
    also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one
    another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves
    the due penalty for their perversion. "\_God gave them over to shameful lust imply
    that being homosexual was deemed by God as lust and therefore against. Thoughts?

    \ has little weight. Vote Con if you find my argument convincing.\n"

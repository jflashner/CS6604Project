    \ to that latter part. Then look back at the title of this debate.\n\n\"In order\
    \ to properly practice Christianity, you must strive for Entire Sanctification\"\
    \n\nIn order to do anything, anything, anything towards following Christianity\
    \ which consists of laws, the teachings of Jesus, ceremonies, customs, commandments,\
    \ you must be connected to the vine. You are a branch. So there is no \"you must\
    \ \" anything. It's the vine that has you to do what you are able to do.\n\nThat's\
    \ the first refutation. Now the \"entire sanctification\" part, I'll be looking\
    \ for clarity on from the other side.\n\n\"Entire Sanctification is the process\

    \ that believe so called Christians can or can't stop sinning after being a so\

    \ and saying as long as you are attached to the vine of Jesus you're fine and\
    \ thus he is ignoring all of Jesus's teachings and commands.What is the fruit\
    \ that Jesus is referring to?\"\n\nThe scripture says of all thy getting, get\
    \ understanding. Let me explain this again so that you can understand what it\
    \ is being said to you this time. Anything that you do in Christ is fruit because\
    \ John 15, go back and read it, meditate on it, get understanding on it, you do\
    \ nothing, nothing, nothing away from the vine. Read John 15, he is the true vine.\n\
    \nSo how can you ignore Jesus when HE IS THE VINE FROM WHICH EVERYTHING YOU DO\
    \ IS PRODUCED FROM?\n\nEither you're ignoring that passage or ignoring me which\
    \ is the same difference . John 15 mentions pruning the branch that it brings\
    \ not just fruit but MUCH fruit.\n\nLet's not get away from the fact that YOU\
    \ SAID, you made the title using the words YOU MUST. YOU ARE JUST A BRANCH. It's\
    \ not you producing anything. At least not in Christ.\n\nRomans 8 speaks of having\
    \ the spirit of Christ. What is the fruit? Being that you have the spirit, you\
    \ have the fruit of the spirit. You live in the spirit. You live after the spirit.\
    \ The spirit leads you. You don't lead yourself and do the best you can.\n\nNo\
    \ no the scripture says, I can do all things through Christ. All this lines up\
    \ .\n\n\"Con would have you believe that but that defeats the purpose of the metaphor.\"\
    \n\nWow like wow. Did you actually read what I said?\\\nYou're not doing this\
    \ on purpose are you?\\\nAre you pretending to go opposite of what I said?\n\n\
    Nobody has to believe or disbelieve anything. Just read . Where did I say \"you\
    \ need not bear good fruits so long as you are attached to the vine\"?\n\nPlease\
    \ quote where I stated that. You produce fruit period because of the vine. It's\
    \ because of the vine, because of it. Scriptures says o fools, and slow of heart.\n\
    \n\"In the words of Jesus, it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. It doth\
    \ not becometh us to cherry pick one or two lines from the bible and use them\
    \ as an excuse to not strive to follow all of Christ's teachings and commandments\
    \ as much as possible.\"\n\nRight, don't cherry pick and how do you avoid doing\
    \ that? You HARMONIZE ALLL OF THE SCRIPTURES. Now I notice you DID NOT DO THAT.\n\
    \nYou had your chance. Step aside, back out the way , I'll do it.\n\nNow the scripture\
    \ you brought, Matthew 5\\\n\"48 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father\
    \ is perfect.\"\n\nNow line upon line with John 15\\\n5 \u201CI am the vine; you\
    \ are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit;\
    \ apart from me you can do nothing.\"\n\nSo which is it? Is it be perfect or can't\
    \ you do anything to be anything before the heavenly Father?\n\nI dare you find\
    \ me scripture that Jesus Christ was not perfect?\n\nSo there you are perfect\
    \ in Jesus that true vine. According to your title \"you must\" this and that.\
    \ Wrong. Scriptures says not of works that any man should boast.\n\nThat's how\
    \ you line those scriptures up. When you cherry pick, you don't line them up and\
    \ pit one against the other.\n"

  content: 'What con is now saying amounts to "the spirit leads you to strive for
    entire sanctification just like Jesus told you to". If you are attached to the
    vine of Christ you must do so because that is what the vine leads you to do. Realistically
    though, the motivation for acting like a Christian comes through faith in Christ
    or at least his teachings. There is no magical vine that makes you bear fruit
    IRL because even if Christianity is true you must (yes, **YOU MUST)** first have
    faith and then consciously start acting like Jesus wants you to. It starts with
    you must and ends with you must.


    Con has effectively accepted entire sanctification, now he just needs to accept
    that you are doing things through Christ and Christ is doing things through you
    and that means you must do things.

    \ heart. You somewhat got it but you're just reading the scriptures. I wonder\
    \ if I was your Sunday school teacher, you'd be apt to learn.\n\nWe don't read\
    \ in John 15 that there's a strive to bring forth fruit. We just do being in the\
    \ vine. I don't believe we read anywhere in scripture that the Spirit leads you\
    \ to strive. You like many probably believe a salvation of works of your own.\n\
    \nWe read in Romans 8\n\n\"14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they\
    \ are the sons of God.\"\n\nIt doesn't say led by the spirit to strive.\n\nThen\
    \ I noticed the double talk . Your statement uses the words \"leads you to strive\"\
    \ , then you follow it up with the words \"told you to\".\n\nWell which is it?\
    \ Are you told to strive or told what you are?\n\nThe conflict you've had with\

    \ \"?\n\nSee I keep drawing you back to John 15. Give scripture to back your position\
    \ up. Don't ad lib with your thoughts. The scripture says let God be true and\
    \ every man a liar.\n\nAin't no \"realistically though \". There is no however\
    \ and on the other jazz. What does that scripture say in John 15? If you actually\
    \ are a believer, it's just AMEN. In terms of this debate, you concede to the\
    \ point.\n\n\"There is no magical vine that makes you bear fruit IRL because even\

    \ leg to stand on.\n\nRomans 10\n\n\"3 For they being ignorant of God's righteousness,\

    \ promoting yourself trying to be righteous all your own.\n\n\"4 For Christ is\
    \ the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.\"\n\nYou said\
    \ \"ends with you must.\"\n\n(In Gino Jennings voice) LLLLLLIAR!!!!\n\nFor righteousness\
    \ of the law ENDS WITH CHRIST, NOT YOU .\n\nIT SAYS CHRIST.\n\nIf you say it begins\
    \ with you, now you're acting ignorant to God's righteousness where He had Christ\
    \ fulfill the law of righteousness. Scriptures says he came to fulfill the law\
    \ so if it starts with you, it didn't start with Christ.\n\nSee you're giving\
    \ me more of your thinking and argumentation than giving scripture. You haven't\
    \ harmonized any scripture or come back with more lines of scripture to line up\
    \ your position.\n\nI give you scripture, you dismiss it and come back with your\
    \ words instead of doing what the scriptures says speaking as the oracles of God.\n\
    \nTaking you back to John 15,\n\n\"16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and\
    \ appointed you so that you might go and bear fruit\"\n\nHow is it going to start\

    \ topic mentioned Christianity.\n\n\"According to wikipedia, \"Christianity is\
    \ an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus\

    \ the book of scripture... called the bible.\"\n\nThere's no bible for \"you must\
    \ strive\" as if it's of your own righteousness. I'd advise you to correct that\
    \ for future references. Keep this in mind when using those terms.\n\nNot of works\
    \ says the bible.\n\nGo to Ephesians 2.\n\n\"8 For it is by grace you have been\
    \ saved, through faith\u2014and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of\

    \ have nothing to boast about.\n\n\"9 not by works, so that no one can boast.\
    \ \"\n\nNothing to boast about. Throw that \"you must\" out of there like it's\
    \ all you.\n\n\"10 For we are God\u2019s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to\
    \ do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.\"\n\nTies again to\
    \ John 15 line upon line it continues to line up , all of this.\n\nCreated to\
    \ do good works. The fruit brought forth , the good works, you didn't start with\
    \ it because you didn't create it.\n\nScriptures teaches in Matthew 7 a good tree\
    \ produces good fruit. Oh taste and see that the Lord is good.\n\nStay out the\
    \ bible if you're not going to be all the way and from topics like these. No place\
    \ to be lukewarm and halfhearted.\n"

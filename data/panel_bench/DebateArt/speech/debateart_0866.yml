  content: "**Introduction**\n\nBefore we start this debate we should get this out\
    \ of the\nway: I am now a socialist abortion activist. I believe this proposal\
    \ is the\nbest way to eliminate income inequality while keeping the capitalist\
    \ scum temporarily\ninundated.\n\n**Justification**\n\n1. Economy\n\nAs we all\
    \ know there is currently a large disparity in\nwealth, babies can be reproduced\
    \ infinitely with the less wealthy creating more\non average. This is especially\
    \ true of the black community, no proposal would help\nthem climb out of poverty\
    \ faster than this one!\n\n2. Eugenics/Dysgenics\n\nMargaret Sanger, a woman I\
    \ greatly admire, once said: \u201CBirth\ncontrol must lead ultimately to a much\
    \ cleaner race.\u201D In order to create the idealist\nutopia I\u2019ve always\
    \ dreamed of we must purge society of ethnic and cultural differences. People\
    \ of differing races would be incentivized (i.e., their\nbabies would fetch more\
    \ hefty a sum). This would eventually result in a glorious socialist ethnostate.\n\
    \n3. Lowered Crime Rate\n\nIt\u2019s a well-known fact that Mexicans and blacks\
    \ have a much\nhigher crime-rate in general than the white population. Instead\
    \ of providing blacks\nwelfare and incentivizing divorce, we could instead make\
    \ their fetuses worth more than the white babies. They would then be happier and\
    \ produce\nless vandals.\n\n4. Reduced levels of institutional corruption\n\n\
    By the public truly owning their means of reproduction the\npower would be taken\
    \ away from overbearing nepotist governments.\n\n**Practicality**\n\n5. Feasibility\n\
    \nAll around the world many women do not think twice about\nkill children \u2013\
    \ depending upon their race and political affiliation, of course.\nI imagine it\
    \ would be easy to convince them of this as an economic solution,\nafter all,\
    \ why be wasteful?\n\n6. Morality\n\nBabies do not have sentience nor intelligence\
    \ prior to 5\nmonths, and thus no moral value as shown by my debate in the description.\
    \ It\nwould be much more moral to trade the arms and legs then let them go to\
    \ waste.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThis is both a practical and moral method of obtaining\n\
    superiority over our neighboring nations who have not thought to implement such\n\
    an economic scheme.\n"

  content: "**Introduction:**\\\nThis is a weird one. My opponent has used the comment\n\
    section to [cast\ndoubt](https://www.debateart.com/debates/866/comment_links/9978)\
    \ that this debate is intended to be a joke, so I can\u2019t argue this\nusing\
    \ troll debate logic. That said, at least to anyone educated and possessing a\
    \ dark sense of humor, I will still\ntry to be entertaining.\n\n**Stability:**\\\
    \nThe current USD has a [good\nlifespan](https://www.federalreserve.gov/faqs/how-long-is-the-life-span-of-us-paper-money.htm),\
    \ ranging from the $10 at 4.5 years to the $100 at 15.0 years for\nbills. Further\
    \ it is easy to transport and store.\n\nUS Fetuses (henceforth USF) outside a\
    \ couple very controlled\n(not to mention cost prohibitive) environments, have\
    \ a lifespan of hours at\nbest, smell bad, and cannot be transported with any\
    \ degree of ease.\n\nAdditionally, the USD is arguably the world\u2019s most stable\n\
    currency. It is used internationally as a standard for trade, even being called\n\
    the [Global Currency](https://www.thebalance.com/world-currency-3305931) by many.\
    \ In contrast, the USF has hyperinflation (poor people printing their\nown money\
    \ at home) listed as a boon, meaning it would lead to [economic\ncollapse](https://www.thebalance.com/when-will-the-u-s-dollar-collapse-3305691)\
    \ in short order.\n\n**Counterfeits:**\\\nThe USD is hard to counterfeit, often\
    \ massively expensive to\ndo so, and typically [easy\nto identify](https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/05/23/three-simple-ways-to-tell-when-money-is-counterfeit/#708adddb3500).\n\
    \nBolstering the stability issue, USF are surprisingly easy to\ncounterfeit. The\
    \ equipment and expertise required to spot a counterfeit are\noutside the means\
    \ of nearly everyone, thus people from other countries would\ntry to bring in\
    \ any random fetus as if it is a genuine USF. Smuggling\noperations would create\
    \ an awful mess in our airports, particularly if any of\nthe counterfeits get\
    \ dropped/spilled.\n\n**Crime:**\\\nIn addition to the counterfeit problem, there\
    \ is the\nlikelihood of theft from fetuses that were intended to become children.\
    \ Right now,\nmuggings are generally non-fatal; this would change when pregnant\
    \ women are\ntargeted for what is inside their person.\n\nFurther [criminals\n\
    are stupid](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/201006/why-criminals-are-less-intelligent-non-criminals),\
    \ so they would probably be attacking women who have been\npregnant five months\
    \ or longer thinking they hit the mother lode (pun intended)\nand thus get a lot\
    \ of USF, when in fact they just have normal worthless dead\nbabies (this also\
    \ counters the race idea proposed by pro, as minority women\nwould be targeted\
    \ more for a higher payout). This feeds back into the\ncounterfeiting problem,\
    \ as five-month old fetus tissue is not obviously\ndistinct from earlier ones\
    \ (admittedly less of a problem at nine-months).\n\n**Usefulness:**\\\nThe USD\
    \ is easily used. Anyone reading this has either used\nit, or a like-currency.\
    \ If you feel like a soda, you slide coins or bills into\na vending machine, and\
    \ it at once dispenses your drink. Total time between\ncraving to sated thirst\
    \ is under a minute.\n\nBeing able to get food at all for a USF, assumes a best-case\n\
    scenario. However, for the USF what happens when we want a soda from a vending\n\
    machine? How many weeks do we have to wait for the genetic testing to confirm\
    \ genuine USF? By the time you get your fractional USF back, is it still viable?\n"

    \ range between [$80 to $110 per\npound](http://southpark.cc.com/clips/104365/breakin-my-balls).\
    \ Given that the average fetus (assuming optimal harvest time) is only [4oz](https://www.webmd.com/baby/4to6-months#1-1),\

    \ supposed\n   to solve.\n\n2. Eugenics/Dysgenics and 3. Lowered Crime Rate\\\n\
    \   I do not see the positive value in racism, but will happily\n   challenge\
    \ any real evidence pro may offer in support of genocide.\n\n3. Reduced levels\
    \ of institutional corruption\\\n   Such schemes have tried and failed in places\
    \ like [Zimbabwe\n   and Venezuela](https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-dont-poorer-countries-just-print-more-money-107633).\

    \ contradictions). ... It\u2019s about like certain pro-life politicians who use\

  content: '**Response to Fallacious Misallegations**\

    I do not mean to offend you, but Merriam Webster is not a reputable source. According
    to the [UN general assembly](http://www.preventgenocide.org/law/convention/text.htm#II),
    the legal definition of genocide under international law is:


    (a) Killing members of the group;\

    (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\

    (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring
    about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\

    (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\

    (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.


    This would be a **proper** source to debunk my claims of eugenics not being equivocable
    to genocide. I really wish you would put more effort into debunking my claims
    on such an incredibly serious topic.


    So, under the UN definition my claim would constitute genocide but under yours
    it does not. As I am not advocating for their destruction, only their forceful
    assimilation. I am also quite hurt that you would make the accusation I am putting
    a "bounty" on the babies heads, I am no monster. These increased valuements only
    serve to assist the black and Mexican population in their bid to climb out of
    poverty, as in an socialist state police force is incredibly strict and would
    deter crime.


    The Google claim was not intended as a source (ovbiously), it was merely intended
    to show how blatantly untrue his claim about the USD not resulting in the targeted
    murder of pregnant women


    Moving the Goalpost\

    I have done no such thing, one of my opening premises was that this would reduce
    overall crime rate. My position has been consistent in this regard. I use baby
    and fetus interchangeably, perhaps this is a mistake in vernacular but it hardly
    matters.


    **Conclusion**\

    My opponent has refused to acknowledge the simple facts I have presented. He confuses
    eugenics with genocide, confuses my position on eugenics with genocide, and cites
    an non-reputable source to back up his unfortunate claim.


    P.S., Kindly ignore my refutation of my own argument and conclusion. I just felt
    like his was insufficient enough to be dribbled out of the mouth of a mutated
    Potatohead doll.

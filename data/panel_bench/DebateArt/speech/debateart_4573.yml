  content: 'No comments or changes to the description. I am fine with new arguments
    in the last round. This is supposed to be short and quick.


    Strategically, If Biden offers to pardon Trump the country will be in a better
    political, and social position then if he does not. While Ford lost his re-election
    because of the Nixon pardon, Nixon was not a candidate anymore. This is most critical
    because Trump is a candidate, and a very popular one.


    **THEREFORE**


    **An offer to pardon would:**


    1. Show Biden will be putting a leash on his administrations DOJ. Clams about
    witch-hunts and unfair prosecutorial practices would not end, however would be
    curtailed significantly.

    2. Refocus the media on issues at hand, such as inflation, crime, ridiculous spending,
    and other issues like the Ukraine money pit.

    3. Save countless dollars on prosecutions, that would be dragged on and on by
    Trump, who is very good at that.

    4. Start to repair the damage to the political system, and inject some confidence
    into the electoral process

    5. Reduce tensions from extremist on both sides.


    **If Trump accepts the pardon, it would**


    1. Be an admission of guilt by Trump. You can''t get a pardon without admitting
    guilt to the charges

    2. Show Trump as capitulating, and would compromise his image, giving Biden an
    advantage

    3. Fundamentally overnight change the nature of the conversation about a witch-hunt

    4. Give Biden the opportunity to review the various classified categorization
    regulations, and make modifications like both Clinton and Obama did.

    5. Give Biden a reason to improve Open Records rights, and slow down the over
    classification of documentation that is occurring.

    6. Sets up a precedence so that if Biden is charged after he leaves office for
    similar crimes, he could get a pardon.


    **If Trump rejects the pardon, it would**


    1. Fundamentally overnight change the nature of the conversation about a witch-hunt

    2. Highlight Trump is in it for him (which we know), which will influence some
    neutrals, or Anti-Biden voters.

    3. Show Trump as wanting and wasting federal resources, which would be a strategic
    benefit to Biden


    Overall, there is very little downside to offering or granting a pardon in the
    grand scheme of things.

    of the country."


    First off I can just speak for myself being that I''m a person of the country
    and the country meaning people.


    I gather from the opposing side is that they''re making a case in a general social
    relationship.


    I''m going to take it in the direction of specifics as we''re dealing with "in
    the best interest of the country".


    That translates to the best interest of people and I''m not excluding one person.


    A best interest is the best. It''s supreme bar none. That means I''m in my best
    living conditions. Anything that has to do with that is a part of that interest.


    Now we''re getting micro specific. Away from macro generalizing.


    My specific situation as part of this country, whether personal or financial business
    can be what it is all the while the affairs are taking place between two other
    individuals of this country that are a part of this country.


    My problems that exist and continue to exist while someone receives a pardon on
    something outside of me serves nothing to the betterment of my circumstances.


    Simply put.


    I take it that the opposing side may have not been expecting this type of direction
    on the topic.


    Perhaps what was being sought was a general mainstream political topical commentary.


    I''ve heard it said that if there is no justice everywhere then you don''t have
    justice.


    It''s the same sentiment with my stance. When talking about the country, it''s
    in reference to all people , not in pockets. When talking about all in tandem
    with "best interest", that is theee best there is. Part of the time, in some places
    , in some areas, in some things is not THE best .


    My interest is a summation of that. I''ve also heard it said that justice is guaranteeing
    that NO person (country) is mistreated(injustice) and that the person that needs
    help the most, gets the most(best) constructive help.


    So we''re not looking at generalities, mainstream news on common typical elements
    focusing perhaps on certain classes and communities.


    Is this pardon in the best interest of "race" relations?


    Does it solve the so called race problem?


    That or any other problem, does it solve it?


    I''ve heard that the so called race problem is the biggest problem.


    If that problem hasn''t been solved yet....pitifully and pathetically speaking,
    anything else is a "so what".


    "In the BEST interest of the COUNTRY". That''s the epicenter I''m presenting.

    I argue that Cons position is a red herring, in that Con is attempting to divert
    attention from the clear and unambiguous description. Furthermore, the description
    makes it very clear that any clarifications will be resolved through comments,
    of which Con made no attempts to clarify their interpretation.


    The question then is; "Is Cons interpretation reasonable, or defendable based
    on the nature of how the resolution was written?" Clearly no. Con''s interpretation
    falls under the category of "absurd results", that being when someone tries to
    interpret something in such a specific way, and the results are clearly beyond
    what was intended, that is an absurd result.


    I reject the totality of Con''s argument as being irrelevant,


    I extend without reservation all my first round arguments.

    of course that person pushes that mess wins the debate to you.


    When you''re talking about best interest, which is ALL of my situation consisting
    of problems, all my problems, a person pardons another in a separate situation
    that didn''t help me any, what was it that worked in the best interest for me?


    Maybe this topic is centered on a particular group. A group that is not downtrodden
    but all they need is a pardon taking place within another party to spread icing
    on their cake on a silver platter.


    Let''s see if the opposing side addressed any of my statements.


    "Con is arguing that grammatically in the best interest of the country is singular,
    absolute, and relative only to themselves."


    I''m going to insist you define your terms so you can''t be evasive, vague and
    obscure.


    Does country mean "all people "?


    Does best interest mean no interest higher or greater to that person?


    "Con is attempting to divert attention from the clear and unambiguous description.\

    Furthermore, the description makes it very clear that any clarifications will
    be resolved through comments, of which Con made no attempts to clarify their interpretation."


    Ok so since you claim you can be so transparent and give excellent clarity, you
    should be able to answer those questions I posted above with clear direct answers.
    Okey-doke.


    "I reject the totality of Con''s argument as being irrelevant, "


    Uh no no no. No evasiveness. See you face the truth, the truth comes out. We know
    it''s no one size fits all but the position you''re taking is promising otherwise.

  content: 'Con has continued the interpretation of this debate as being a personal
    one. The judges will need to determine, does the resolution apply to an individual
    or the greater good.


    The descriptions states:


    > Con must show that giving Trump a pardon would not be in the best interest of
    the country.


    The description clearly shows that the issue of a pardons best interest applies
    to the country, the grand masse, not the individual. Con has flagrantly and erroneously
    tried to twist the target of the debate.


    Con asks if country means all people. The term country is very ubiquitous, and
    a definition now is a little late, even as I asked for any clarifications to occur
    in comments prior to the debate. A country is "a nation with its own government,
    [occupying](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA984CA985&sxsrf=APwXEdfGHd1cnPBrwbIBlDRc4E-E76cm-g:1687182442223&q=occupying&si=AMnBZoFEI0LGJdD1jElhAGFwRnmo3DLrIom0m7Q7cRnq5OpYGb_D1lP_W_IburxP9gbG9zOXMMqcg8OXuK9yaF7V7XgirTCtHw%3D%3D&expnd=1)
    a particular territory." There is nothing remotely infferable that the reference
    to a country could mean an individual needs. To be clear, to Con, the answer is
    clear. The word country does not mean an individual, and could never be inferred
    as such.


    Con has not refuted any of Pro''s reasons. I have refuted 2x the same argument
    from Con, that being a twisting of definitions of a country to the individual.


    Let me make this clear. I agree with Con that the pardon of Trump would not benefit
    Con personally. That is not the issue. Con''s unwillingness to address the logic
    used on why Biden should pardon Trump is disappointing, and cowardly.

    This is a prime example of not understanding the words that we use. Is not what''s
    in my best interest personal?\

    The individual or the greater good. What is the greater good and why is the distinction
    or demarcation being made?


    This topic and the opposing side''s position wasn''t thought all the way through.
    It''s turning out to be very paradoxical.


    "Con must show that giving Trump a pardon would not be in the best interest of
    the country."


    Am I a part of the country or not ? So why isn''t when I show that somebody else''s
    pardon is not doing anything for me, you shift who or what exactly the country
    is or represents? See I know this position is just causing you to shoot yourself
    in the foot.


    The country suppose the represent the people. I must not be a part of the people.
    According to you it''s like I''m not a person.\

    You said "country". That would include me wouldn''t it? Now you move the goalpost
    and trying to make a demarcation like it''s others except me or specific higher
    up folks instead of downtrodden niches that you know have problems for days regardless
    of what happens. Maybe you don''t know. You should know that everybody has unique
    problems and it''s not a one size fits all solution.


    Don''t be so hasty with the words "best interest" for the " country" because I''ll
    make you identify who and what you''re referring to.


    " " A country is "a nation with its own government, occupying a particular territory."
    "


    A county is nation of WHAT? PEOPLE.


    PEOPLE MAKE UP A NATION. DO WE ALL GET THIS?


    PEOPLE ARE MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS OF PERSONS. DO WE GET THAT?


    Stop being indirect with terms like "nation"...."territory"......"government".


    You''re talking about people. So because you weren''t clear in stating verbatim
    it CAN''T MEAN ALL PEOPLE, I''ll step in and say it is. Logically speaking each
    INDIVIDUAL person in the land of a nation or country is still that .


    "There is nothing remotely infferable that the reference to a country could mean
    an individual needs. To be clear, to Con, the answer is clear. The word country
    does not mean an individual, and could never be inferred as such."


    Then to whom or what is the term "country" referring to?


    You were too vague with the term . Most of if not all your talking points was
    about political figures and the effects of them in particular. I don''t recall
    one point you made outlining the benefit of every household, community, town,
    city, state, the youth or seniors. I''m more clear breaking down what this would
    mean when it comes to people then you. Particularly getting down to the essence
    of "in the best interest".


    When we say in the best interest of the country, are we not referring to all people?
    Are we referring to people at all? Is country referring to the land, soil, grass
    and ants?


    Ok what does the best interest of the grounds have to do with us? If it doesn''t
    include people, you can let the ants and grass debate this topic.


    "Con has not refuted any of Pro''s reasons. I have refuted 2x the same argument
    from Con, that being a twisting of definitions of a country to the iindividual"


    I refuted them a million times over with one single knockout punch. Nothing you
    said went to my best interest. If you fail to argue how this can help me , how
    in the world of countries that exist on it...can it help a single country? A country
    that is FULL OF INDIVIDUALS, individual persons that will respond such as I making
    a case about their unique issues probably the same or similar.


    Do you see where you got stuck in your position?


    "Let me make this clear. I agree with Con that the pardon of Trump would not benefit
    Con personally."


    Oh yes, concede. Remember, it''s not just me. Others that are in similar circumstances
    across the country will take the same stance. So you really should of buckled
    down specifically the groups of people in "the country" you were identifying.


    You should of quantified your point when you say " the greater good". Who is that?
    How many is that?


    I nail you down with those details.


    "That is not the issue. Con''s unwillingness to address the logic used on why
    Biden should pardon Trump is disappointing, and cowardly"


    It is the issue unless you can prove I''m not another individual of the country.
    You said I was to prove how somebody pardoning somebody else would not be in the
    best interest of the country.


    Maybe you should of said everybody but who I''m debating, in the best interest
    of the rest of us .


    In this topic, you really should of been more careful with words. Just taking
    me out of it, we don''t know every person''s situation in the country to make
    a one size fits all benefit to the country claiming that something is in the best
    interest of all .


    I don''t know what is in the best of you, him, her, they because the unique problem
    necessitates a unique solution.


    The truth is, this topic is stemming from a perspective lense that you haven''t
    made clear of who actually you have in mind when using the term "country".


    I exposed the clarity ambiguity fallacy from the opposing side.

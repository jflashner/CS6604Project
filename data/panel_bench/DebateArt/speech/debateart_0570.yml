  content: 'For thousands of years, the religion of Judaism was practiced by the Hebrew
    tribes. The religion espouses a racially supremacist ideology which claims that
    the Hebrew race is superior, and chosen by God himself to rule the earth. Only
    in the last few hundred years have the words "Jew" and "Hebrew" meant the same
    thing. These modern Jews have little to no proven connection to the Hebrews genetically,
    the majority of their DNA coming from Europe or from Arabs depending on the group.
    So why do people practice a religion which claims an extinct group of tribes is
    the master race and the vast majority of their ancestors are savages? It is because
    Jews have in-group preference and a certain collective status in society, by inventing
    this new race, Judaism becomes more than a religion but an elitist race cult where
    you get to actually choose your race by converting to a religion. Think about
    this, I could convert to Judaism right now, marry a Jewish woman who is genetically
    German and my kids would be considered Jewish by RACE even if they were ATHEISTS.
    How diluted is the actual Hebrew blood in this race cult? There are Jews who are
    literally Aryan by DNA, and would be considered part of the master race by Hitler
    himself if looks and DNA is all he had to go on, but because enough non-Hebrew
    people converted to the so called "race" of Judaism apparently they are part of
    an entirely different master race. The one that claims every Jew will have 1000
    gentile slaves when the messiah comes.\

    The irony is truly astounding.

  content: 'The Jews are both an ethnic group and a religious group that have been
    recorded throughout history, what ignited the Jewish diaspora was the Destruction
    of Second Temple by the Romans in 70 CE, which caused the Jews to go all over
    the world, hence the European and Arabic DNA. To be ethnically Jewish, one parent,
    (traditionally the mother), has to be Jewish, so the person is still of Jewish
    descent despite intermarriage. There have been Jews in the region of Palestine
    even in the time of the Umayyads, the Crusades, and the Ottoman Empire. The Jews
    have also experienced oppressive laws throughout history, from not being allowed
    to own property in Europe in the Middle Ages, being a target by Crusaders in the
    Crusades, being blamed for the Black Plague, progroms in the Russian Empire, and
    the Holocaust, which wiped out 6 million Jews. Throughout history, being Jewish
    has been a disadvantage yet the Jewish people and the Jewish identity has lasted.
    For a cult to be a cult, it has to be highly centralized with a clear leader and
    a strict set of beliefs. The fact that Judaism has multiple sects with different
    beliefs counters this idea that Judaism is a cult. (See Orthodox Jews, Reform
    Jews, and Secular Jews)

    It''s funny you should mention this, because according to this Judaism was born
    at the precise time the Hebrew tribes starting mixing with other races and losing
    their status as an actual race. Let it be stated that the Judaism of today is
    not the same as that before the time you are referring to, which is the time when
    Judaism evolved into what closely resembles it''s current form. The concept that
    Judaism itself is a race is even newer, Because even the Talmud recognises the
    difference between a Hebrew and a Jew. If you are a Hebrew you are expected to
    be a Jew traditionally, but Judaism was always considered a religion and Hebrew
    was considered a race, a race which no longer technically exists and which only
    has a tiny presence in the DNA of modern ethnic Jews.

    For example, in studies of mice, it appears to cause neuronal damage and have

    it is important to note that these effects won''t necessarily be the same for
    humans, however animal testing is used to give us a rough idea of how a given
    substance or stimulus will affect humans. Also human neurons are chemically no
    different than those of most other animals. Another issue to note is that all
    human research that I can find concerns MSG as a cause of headaches and "CRS":
    Chinese restaurant syndrome (and appears to, for the most part, reject this causation).
    Whether MSG causes headaches and "CRS" is completely aside from any of the effects
    suggested by the rodent literature.Sources:(1) <http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/4/1007.full.pdf(2)>

  content: "Thank you pro!\n\nSince pro did not provide a definition for the word\
    \ \"problem.\" Based on my understanding of the resolution, it is my burden to\
    \ show that MSG is generally safe for the general population.\n\nThat said, no\
    \ one food or substance can provide all the necessary ingredients.\n\n**What is\
    \ MSG**\n\n_\"Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a flavor enhancer commonly added to\
    \ Chinese food, canned vegetables, soups and processed meats. The Food and Drug\
    \ Administration (FDA) has classified MSG as a food ingredient that's \"generally\
    \ recognized as safe,\" but its use remains controversial. For this reason, when\
    \ MSG is added to food, the FDA requires that it be listed on the label._\n\n\
    _...\\[R\\]esearchers have found **no definitive evidence of a link between MSG\
    \ and these symptoms**. Researchers acknowledge, though, that a small percentage\
    \ of people may have short-term reactions to MSG. Symptoms are usually mild and\
    \ don't require treatment. The only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid foods\
    \ containing MSG. \"_\n\n<https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196>\n\
    \nIt should be pointed out that all foods will have some people who are allergic\
    \ to that food. Prime example being gluten. While no evidence suggests that gluten\
    \ is a problem or inherently dangerous, some people need to avoid it.\n\n**What\
    \ dose the evidence say?**\n\nThe FDA writes;\n\n_\"**FDA considers the addition\
    \ of MSG to foods to be \u201Cgenerally recognized as safe\u201D** (GRAS). Although\
    \ many people identify themselves as sensitive to MSG, in studies with such individuals\
    \ given MSG or a placebo, **scientists have not been able to consistently trigger\
    \ reactions.**_\n\n_Over the years, FDA has received reports of symptoms such\
    \ as headache and nausea after eating foods containing MSG. However, **we were\
    \ never able to confirm that the MSG caused the reported effects.**_\n\n_These\
    \ adverse event reports helped trigger FDA to ask the independent scientific group\
    \ **Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) to examine\
    \ the safety of MSG in the 1990s. FASEB\u2019s report concluded that MSG is safe**.\
    \ The FASEB report identified some short-term, transient, and generally mild symptoms,\
    \ such as headache, numbness, flushing, tingling, palpitations, and drowsiness\
    \ that may occur in some sensitive individuals who consume 3 grams or more of\
    \ MSG without food. However, a typical serving of a food with added MSG contains\
    \ less than 0.5 grams of MSG. Consuming more than 3 grams of MSG without food\
    \ at one time is unlikely.\"_\n\n<https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/foodadditivesingredients/ucm328728.htm>\n\
    \n**Conclusion**\n\nMSG is generally safe and is not a problem. Although there\
    \ are people who should avoid it, that doesn't mean MSG is a problem. Gluten,\
    \ nuts, milk, eggs, soy, and shellfish are safe to eat, but are common allergens\
    \ and should be avoided by certain people.\n\nThe resolution is negated.\n\nOnto\
    \ pro's case....\n\nIt's kinda hard for me to understand exactly what pro is arguing\
    \ here.\n\n\"My reading of the literature is that MSG appears to be bad for one's\
    \ health. Glutamate acts as a neurotransmitter (Source 1) and generally isn't\
    \ part of our diet in the free form such as that found in MSG.\"\n\nThis is straight\
    \ up false. Glutamate is an acid that is naturally present in foods and bodies\
    \ (source: see the fda link provided above). Furthermore, glutamate is found naturally\
    \ in other foods as well. For example, cow's milk, human mother's milk, corn,\
    \ potatoes, broccoli, chicken, and beef all naturally contain a significant portion\
    \ of glutamate.\n\nSource: <https://msgfacts.com/glutamate-in-food/>\n\n\"As one\
    \ would expect from ingesting neurotransmitters in free form, there appear to\
    \ be negative effects. For example, in studies of mice, it appears to cause neuronal\
    \ damage and have a negative effect on memory (Source 2,3,4). There also appear\
    \ to be negative effects on the male reproductive systems of mice (Source 5),\
    \ body weights (obesity) and thyroid function (Source 6) and oxidative damage\
    \ to internal organs (Source 7).\"\n\nExcept no one ingests neurotransmitters\
    \ in free form. It's a strawman to connect free form of a neurotransmitter to\
    \ MSG.\\\n\"Another issue to note is that all human research that I can find concerns\
    \ MSG as a cause of headaches and \"CRS\": Chinese restaurant syndrome (and appears\
    \ to, for the most part, reject this causation). Whether MSG causes headaches\
    \ and \"CRS\" is completely aside from any of the effects suggested by the rodent\
    \ literature.\"\n\nI found several studies that would disagree\n\n_**\"\\[C\\\
    ]ausal relationship between MSG and headache has not been proven**. In addition,\
    \ statistically significant differences in the incidence of headache were not\
    \ observed when MSG was administered with food, except in one case of the female\
    \ group where the blind integrity was questionable. **It would seem premature\
    \ to conclude that the MSG present in food causes headache.\"**_\n\n<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4870486/>\\\
    \n_\"Despite a widespread belief that MSG can elicit a headache, among other symptoms,\
    \ **there are no consistent clinical data to support this claim.** Findings from\
    \ the literature indicate that there is no consistent evidence to suggest that\
    \ individuals may be uniquely sensitive to MSG. Nurse practitioners should therefore\
    \ concentrate their efforts on advising patients of the nutritional pitfalls of\
    \ some Chinese restaurant meals and to seek more consistently documented etiologies\
    \ for symptoms such as headache, xerostomia, or flushing.\"_\n\n<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16999713>\n\
    \nI rest my case. Vote con!\n"

  content: '1. My opponent begins to attack my source as unreliable, which is ironic
    as his source is a forum post from a site dedicated to magic mushrooms. Quite
    ironic. He provided absolutely no examples of the FDA being corrupt or taking
    bribes. Pro needs to provide examples and evidence within the debate for his argument
    to stand. Don''t let a link argue your case for you.


    2. His source provides absolutely no evidence for that assertion. There are no
    links to research papers regarding his "GARD" diet. While too much sugar is certainly
    bad for you, sugar is important in our diet. Sugar is naturally present in foods
    like fruit.


    3. Nothing but attacks without any evidence. "You are a Janus-faced wanker appealing
    to authority..." Pretty awful conduct if you ask me.


    Furthermore, pro drops every single case regarding my rebuttals.


    I strongly urge a con vote. Thank you and good night.

    \nThe definitions are set in the description. No changes had been made via the\
    \ comments.\n\nCon needs to show that race based genetic discussions do contribute\
    \ to racism, and that it is unacceptable as a result. Pro needs to show that genetic\
    \ based discussions around race do not contribute to racism, and are acceptable\
    \ to discuss.\n\nEach race will have some genetic traits that trend through that\
    \ ethnic group. Irish tend to have pale skin. The Dutch tend to be tall, while\
    \ south East Asians tend to be shorter. The \u201Cyou look....<insert ethnic group>\
    \ \u201C is something that we hear all the time.\n\nThe resolution states that\
    \ those comments are unacceptable. Linguistically we could split a hair and say\
    \ that any comment is acceptable based on an individual interest. However this\
    \ is not a trap debate. The notion of acceptable is in the context of a western\
    \ based social norm. I outline 6 key reasons why genetic based race differences\
    \ are important to discuss and by no means contribute to racism, and therefore\
    \ are acceptable.\n\n**The first** is about basic genetic knowledge. Discussing\
    \ race-based genetic differences allows for a deeper understanding of human genetic\
    \ variation and its implications. These discussions can help address health disparities\
    \ and develop targeted treatments for specific populations. The National Human\
    \ Genome Research Institute ([NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/educational-resources/fact-sheets/human-genome-project)),\
    \ a division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, published a factsheet\
    \ that emphasizes the importance of studying genetic variation across populations\
    \ to enhance scientific knowledge and improve health outcomes. Open and informed\
    \ dialogue is essential for scientific progress and improving healthcare delivery.\
    \ For this reason alone, Con would lose the debate, unless they showed that discussing\
    \ race-hased genetic differences was not important, or that the harm caused is\
    \ worse than the benefit gained.\n\n**The second** point is about ancestry. By\
    \ examining race-based genetic differences have provided valuable insights into\
    \ human migration patterns, population history, and adaptations. A study published\
    \ in Nature demonstrated the power of genomic research in uncovering human history\
    \ and population structure, showcasing the importance of understanding genetic\
    \ differences, seen in publication Nature, [The Genetic History of Ice Age Europe](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature17993).\
    \ Recognizing and appreciating these differences can foster a sense of cultural\
    \ pride and promote inclusivity by celebrating the rich tapestry of human ancestry.\n\
    \n**On the third front**, we can used the study and discussion of race-based genetics\
    \ to combat racism. Engaging in discussions about race-based genetic differences\
    \ allows for the correction of misconceptions and stereotypes. It is those stereotypes\
    \ and misconceptions that contribute to racism. It is important to approach these\
    \ discussions with evidence-based research to challenge false notions of racial\
    \ superiority or inferiority. The [American Association of Physical Anthropologists](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.23882)\
    \ (AAPA) emphasizes that the study of human biological variation helps dismantle\
    \ harmful stereotypes and encourages scientific education and understanding. By\
    \ promoting accurate information, discussions about genetic diversity can counter\
    \ racism by debunking unfounded beliefs and fostering a more enlightened perspective.\
    \ Let me be clear. Discussing race-based genetic differences can help combat racism.\n\
    \n**Fourth** we know race-based genetic differences also need to be discussed\
    \ for the delivery of and facilitating personalized medicine and healthcare: Acknowledging\
    \ race-based genetic differences can lead to advancements in personalized medicine\
    \ and healthcare practices. Genetic variations across populations can affect disease\
    \ susceptibility, treatment responses, and drug metabolism. The National Institutes\
    \ of Health (NIH), through their [Precision Medicine Initiative](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-turning-discovery-into-health/promise-precision-medicine)\
    \ recognizes that understanding genetic diversity is essential for improving healthcare\
    \ equity and delivering precision medicine. We know that by discussing these differences,\
    \ healthcare providers can offer tailored interventions that consider individual\
    \ and population-specific genetic variations, thus improving health outcomes and\
    \ reducing health disparities.\n\n**Fifth** is about enhancing social and cultural\
    \ understanding: [The American Society of Human Genetics](https://www.ashg.org/publications-news/ashg-news/new-report-examines-diversity-in-the-human-genetics-and-genomics-workforce/)\
    \ (ASHG) encourages the study of genetic variation to promote diversity, equity,\
    \ and inclusion in genetics research and beyond. It is established that conversations\
    \ about race-based genetic differences can contribute to a broader understanding\
    \ of social and cultural dynamics. Recognizing the role of genetics in shaping\
    \ different populations can foster empathy, cultural sensitivity, and a more inclusive\
    \ society. These discussions can provide a foundation for meaningful conversations\
    \ about identity, history, and the shared human experience.\n\n**Finally,** and\
    \ the most important is about safeguarding academic freedom and intellectual inquiry:\
    \ Cancel culture, and making certain conversation taboo or discussions about race-based\
    \ genetic differences can infringe upon academic freedom and hinder intellectual\
    \ inquiry..  [The American Association of University Professors](https://www.aaup.org/report/1940-statement-principles-academic-freedom-and-tenure)\
    \ (AAUP) emphasizes the importance of academic freedom in fostering an environment\
    \ that promotes critical thinking, scholarly exploration, and the pursuit of truth\
    \ By allowing discussions about race-based genetic differences, academic institutions\
    \ can uphold the principles of intellectual freedom and advance scientific understanding.\
    \ These discussions do not lead to racism, and are inherently acceptable and required\
    \ for academic and intellectual purposes.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHaving discussions\
    \ about race-based genetics is not an automatic contributor to racism, and should\
    \ be allowed.\n"

  content: '**Topic**\

    Discussing race-based genetic differences is a significant contributor to racism
    and is therefore unacceptable.


    **Definitions**\

    Discussing: Any form of public communication.\

    Race: An ethnic group.\

    Significant: a measurable quality worthy of attention.\

    Racism: The belief that races (ethnic groups) are as a whole superior or inferior.\

    Unacceptable: Not contiguous with social values.


    **Introduction**\

    Pro must establish that genetic difference conversations as applied to a race
    contributes to racism to such a degree, that it should not occur. Should not occur
    is a general catch-all kind of like a social embargo.


    **Arguments**\

    Arguments are divided into 3 parts:


    1. Argument from morality

    2. Argument from possibility

    3. Argument from history


    **1. Argument from morality**\

    There are 6 types of actions:


    1. Action that causes only good and causes no evil.

    2. Action that causes more good than evil.

    3. Action that causes equal amount of good and evil.

    4. Action that causes more evil than good.

    5. Action that causes only evil and causes no good.

    6. Action that causes no evil and no good.


    We should always do that which is best. Action 1 is always the best. We should
    always do action 1.


    Action number 1 is objectively the best, but also the only one among these that
    is morally acceptable. Number 1 would inspire others to do good, since number
    1 is good in the pure form of good. It does not contain any evil. Action that
    contains no evil cannot motivate others to do evil. Therefore, number 1 cannot
    motivate others to do evil.


    Number 2 may seem like morally acceptable, but its not.\

    Killing 1 innocent person and using his organs to save 10 other lives is an action
    that causes much more good than evil. However, such action is unacceptable. Therefore,
    actions that cause much more good than evil are unacceptable.


    If we are faced with only two options, like in the case above:\

    A. Action that causes more good than evil.\

    B. Lack of action that results in more evil than good.,\

    to stay morally consistent and to be high in morality, we would have to choose
    B. every time, since A. contains evil caused by our actions, where in the case
    of B. the evil is not caused by us.


    We should rather refuse to do action A, even when the lack of such action results
    in more evil than good.\

    2 is often based on uncertainty, where you are certain that your actions will
    cause evil, but uncertain if they will cause good.\

    If you are uncertain that your actions will cause good, then your morality is
    based on uncertainty.\

    Since 2 always causes evil, we are faced with the risk of such evil moving others
    to do more evil. Those hurt by such evil could be moved to do more evil. Moving
    others to do evil is unstable. Therefore, number 2 is unpredictable and unstable
    moral system.


    One might say: "But if the lack of action causes more evil than doing action,
    wouldnt lack of action also move people who were hurt by evil (resulted from lack
    of action) to do evil?"


    And that is why lack of action is not what should be done. Rather, we should do
    actions that contain only good, to move others to do good. That is the most stable,
    most consistent moral system.


    Number 3 is wrong by all standards, but it is often very hard to tell the difference
    between 2 and 3. That is another reason why 2 is wrong.


    By Categorical Imperative, actions that cause only good and contain no evil are
    good actions, since they can be done by everyone in society. Doing only good serves
    as mover for everyone to do good.\

    On the other hand, actions that contain even the smallest amount of evil, if repeatedly
    done by everyone in society, would add up to great evil. Therefore, such actions
    cannot be stable. Therefore, only society built on 1 can be stable society.


    Since morality demands of us to do only good actions, and good actions contain
    no evil, it follows that morality demands of us to not do any evil. Our actions
    must contain only good. They must not contain any evil.


    Which brings us to morality of discussing genetic differences in races.


    Discussing genetic differences contains evil. The comparison in which one race
    ends up looking better than other causes people to think that one race is better
    than the other, which causes a sense of superiority and the need to spread the
    message. We often see people post about genetic superiority of white race. Many
    buy into the story, and it fuels racism among young people.\

    Therefore, my opponent cannot argue that his position is defending 1 (causing
    no evil).


    My opponent can only argue for 2, that is:\

    That "discussing race-based genetic differences" causes more good than evil.


    On that grounds alone, he has already lost the moral argument, since his position
    contains evil where mine doesnt.


    My position is simple. People should not discuss race-based genetic differences.
    My position, being the lack of such harmful action, causes no harm, and leaves
    room for doing those actions that are pure good.\

    Leaving room for actions that are pure good is what every society should seek
    to do. Banning the race-based discussions means leaving room for actions that
    are pure good. Banning the race-based discussions is what every society should
    seek to do.


    **2. Argument from possibility**


    Can my opponent guarantee that his position will cause no racism? He cant. Can
    he guarantee that his position will cause no evil? He cant. Can he guarantee that
    someone wont use the knowledge gained from discussions for the purposes of spreading
    propaganda against black people? He cant.\

    I can guarantee that my opponent''s position will cause racism. I can guarantee
    that his position will cause evil. I can guarantee that many will use the knowledge
    gained from discussions for the purposes of spreading propaganda against black
    people.


    Therefore, my position makes the possibility of good by banning those discussions,
    where my opponent''s position creates possibility of evil. Possibility of good
    is better than possibility of evil. It follows that my position is better than
    the position of my opponent in terms of good and evil.


    **3. Argument from history**


    Some think that racism started with Adolf Hitler. However, racism started long
    before Adolf Hitler.\

    Adolf Hitler was the result of centuries of racism that was spread throughout
    the world thanks to same discussions my opponent is defending today.\

    Adolf Hitler wrote many books in which he examined differences between white,
    black and jew. These differences, which included heritable traits commonly known
    as genes, served as main propaganda in Hitler''s movement. The Hitler''s movement
    resulted in mass murder on world-wide scale. It all started with simple racism,
    simple "my race is better than your race".


    Race-based genetic discussions produced nothing good. Ever. They produced lots
    of evil throughout history, and are still producing evil today.


    If we know that such discussions cause racism and violence, we should not do such
    discussions.\

    We know that such discussions cause racism and violence.\

    We should not do such discussions.


    **Conclusion:**\

    Morality, possibility and history point to the evils of these race-based discussions.
    Hence, such discussions should be discouraged everywhere. They are useless, bring
    nothing good, but bring only harm.

- debater_name: Best.Korea
  content: '**Argument from morality**


    - **Dropped entirely**


    Morality is divided on 3 best actions:


    1. Action that causes only good and that contains no evil.

    2. Action that causes more good than evil and that contains evil.

    3. Lack of action.


    1 is always the best of these three.\

    I proved that my opponent''s position contains evil, therefore it cannot be 1.\

    I also proved that my opponent''s position isnt 3, therefore the only way he could
    justify his position is by defending it as 2.\

    However, he never defended it as 2. Therefore, he clearly lost the moral argument.\

    Even if he did defend it as 2, I pointed out examples where 3 is better than 2.
    Therefore, he would have to not only defend it as 2, but also prove that 2 is
    better than 3 in this case. He did none of that.\

    I proved that my position allows for 1 to take place, since not doing 2 allows
    us to do 1 instead. Not discussing race-based genetic differences in public allows
    for discussing something more useful.\

    I proved that my opponent''s position would result in much more evil than good.
    He never refuted that, and never provided his own comparison of harms and benefits.
    Therefore, he lost the moral argument.\

    My opponent tried to say that this isnt a debate about morality. However, that
    was already refuted in round 2.


    **Argument from possibility**


    - **Dropped entirely**


    My opponent didnt even respond to this argument.


    **Argument from history**


    - **Dropped entirely**


    My opponent never refuted historical examples of discussing race-based genetic
    differences leading not only to racism, but to mass murder on world-wide scale.\

    That alone is enough to make his entire position invalid.


    **Conclusion**


    With the 3 arguments I provided being crucial for topic and being all dropped
    by my opponent, it follows that discussing race-based genetic differences in public
    is undesirable and should be discouraged. To not do so would mean we learned nothing
    from history.

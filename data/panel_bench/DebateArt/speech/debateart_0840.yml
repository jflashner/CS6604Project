  content: 'Hey Ralph, thanks for taking up the debate. Hopefully I learn something
    from this, so enlighten me on your side as well.


    **Opening arguments:**\

    This seems to be an ongoing issue/debate that will never end. I''m going to give
    my ultimate take on it. Looking at every aspect down to the last detail. Hopefully
    this opens up someone''s eyes, especially someone who is a sub only person and
    who is anti-dub. I grew up watching Naruto in dub, that was my first anime that
    I officially got into. On Toonami, they showed Naruto in English. So naturally,
    every other anime I watched was in English since it is my native language. Just
    as I watch anime in English, for me, it is no different for movies or regular
    TV shows. For example, a sitcom. If you are going to a movie theater, the movie
    will be in English, right? Well for me, anime is no different. I''m watching it
    in English, simply put.


    **Theory:** Please correct me if I''m wrong: There are people who grew up watching
    anime in dub (like myself) so they will be used to it and naturally watch other
    anime in dub. The same goes for people who may have grew up watching anime in
    sub so of course they are going to be used to it as well. If they watch an anime
    in dub they are going to feel weird watching it and it won''t feel right or normal.
    My theory leads up to these two points.


    1. I never understood the whole "Dub is so bad" or "Dub is trash" I can''t fathom
    my head around it because how could someone say something like that especially
    if it''s your native language? Meaning a language that you speak and understand?
    How does it not resonate with people? I have watched pretty much everything in
    dub, and they sound fine to me. So what sounds good to me, may sound bad to a
    person who prefers sub. (Is that right?) Since that''s all I watch.


    2. The golden question: _"Sub vs Dub, which do you prefer?"_ It was never a preference
    for me. How is preference even being brought up? I speak English so I''m going
    to watch any form of entertainment in English. People who are sub only AND bashes
    people who watch dub act like it''s so taboo to watch something that''s in your
    native language. I also never understood the "dub ruins the experience" thing.
    I connect with characters more emotionally in English since I can comprehend what''s
    being said.


    **Elaboration:**\

    I feel like you shouldn''t watch it in sub just because it''s anime and written
    by Japanese people. Someone once told me that I''m not a real anime fan if I watch
    anime dubbed instead subbed, which I find ridiculous. Let people like what they
    like whether it be sub or dub. Even sub bias people and people who are strictly
    sub admit that there are great dubs out there that excel their original/sub counterparts.
    Some people for the most part love to say dub is bad just to say it, just to hate
    and to ride this hate train it seems. It''s a shame how I''m even hesitant of
    telling people that I watch dub because they will more than likely overreact as
    if it''s the end of the world just because they watch sub. Just as people say
    dubs are bad, there are also bad subs. For example I''ve heard from many people
    that they don''t like the main character''s Japanese voice from Black Clover at
    all.


    I do watch sub. I''m used to it and I have to deal with it since I have no other
    choice. Overall I''ve seen 30+ anime and 99% of them I''ve seen in dub of course.
    The only series I''ve seen in sub are: Food wars, Attack on Titan S3, Inuyashiki,
    Boruto, Sword Art Online S3, I finished the rest of Naruto Shippuden in sub, and
    I''m watching One piece in sub (up to date). I watched Naruto & One piece dubbed
    mostly, But I reached up to date for them in dub so I switched to the sub since
    dub updates take forever. I''m now watching One punch man S2 in sub. I wanted
    to wait for the dub to drop but it''s taking too long. I''m glad I started watching
    it, it''s breathtaking right now. I do give credit where credit is due. The voice
    actors are good so I understand people who prefer sub. Even so, sub is still annoying.\

    If it''s a long running series such as Naruto, One piece, Hunter x Hunter, Fairy
    Tail or Bleach I''m definitely not watching it in sub. I''d rather watch a short
    series that''s 12 or 24 episodes long in sub, since it''s not an abundant amount
    of episodes. If a short series is amazing and one that''s been recommended to
    me which happens to be a sub-only series, then I''ll watch it. Again, as you can
    tell I only watch sub if I have no other choice which means 1. There is no dub
    version of the series at all. 2. I''ve reached up to date in dub, and I switch
    to sub since dub updates take literally forever to come. 3. The dub version of
    a new season of an anime or a whole new anime hasn''t dropped yet since the sub
    is superior. For ex. One punch man S2 -- I have no clue when the dub will drop
    but I already know it might take a long time. So, I''m watching the sub because
    of the hype and I couldn''t wait, and I''ll re-watch it in dub. If a series has
    both sub and dub options then I''m going with dub.


    To conclude, more respect should be shown for dub and it shouldn''t be so condemned
    and looked down upon just because people watch it.


    Next round I will respond to your rebuttals and I will list the other half of
    my argument which will be me naming the Cons for sub (as to why I am a dub person)

    '
- debater_name: Wrick-It-Ralph
  content: 'I''m going to approach this intuitively.


    Ultimately, the answer to this question is subjective. That means there are a
    few key ways to approach it.


    1. Collective subjective.


    This is not an argument but rather a methodology. We can pull ad populum preferences
    out of the system and asses the base subjective reasons that people judge anime.


    This would be where we get the "if'' to our "ought" so to speak.


    2. Arbitrary standards.


    This follows from the first method. We basically take the subjective standards
    for the anime and judge them objectively. This is where we will differ because
    we will take on different axioms in terms of anime watching.


    3. Non arbitrary standards.


    This is where we judge the very act of watching anime in an apathetic and analytic
    fashion. As far as I can tell, there is no way to draw a conclusion from this
    besides "it''s subjective" If I''m being technical, this fails specifically because
    of Hume''s Guillotine.


    Conclusion


    We need to hash out the standards.


    So let''s do that.


    I would say that ability to comprehend the anime is key. I would argue that sub
    is better for this, because it allows you to draw upon the tone of actual Japanese
    voice actors. In contrast, the dub voice actors must draw from translated or sometimes
    retranslated scripts that do not carry the same context. This means that the voice
    actor might not have the same emotion in their voice that was suppose to be in
    the original. Furthermore, the Japanese actors are drawing from the original script
    and have a director to tell them what they are suppose to feel. This means that
    the dub voice actor will generally fair better in delivering good comprehension.


    Storyline preservation is next up for me. I feel like the dub needs to match the
    original story line as much as possible. This boils down to politics to some extent.
    Dubs that get filtered into America sometimes get censored or storylines get changed
    to get better ratings. Yugioh and pokemon are good examples of this. Yugioh got
    targeted for censorship because some people thought it had satanic messages in
    it. pokemon had this as well and also had sexual connotations that were taken
    out, although these cases were more rare.


    I think any argument beyond this would be a matter of preference.

    '
- debater_name: King_8
  content: 'Thanks for the response. Based off your argument, I would like you to
    respond to each of my points and choose whether it''s subjective (based off personal
    feelings/opinions) or objective (facts). Feel free to rebuttal each point if need
    be.


    **Cons of sub and why am I a dub person. I will demonstrate how the cons outweigh
    the pros for sub.**


    1. Dub is simply easier to watch. I like watching anime and knowing what is being
    said at the same time, rather than having to keep looking down to read. I don''t
    want to read while being entertained. At times, you tend to miss out on the visuals
    (for example, a series with lots of action will have intense fight scenes) I''m
    a visual person, I like to just focus on the art style and animation. Although
    I am a fast reader and everything, sub can still be annoying.


    2. Sometimes the subtitles can pop up and disappear TOO fast, so you''d either
    have to pause or rewind to read what you missed which is annoying. Even if you
    are a fast reader, the subs can pop up for about 1 second and it''s a very long
    sentence which isn''t enough time to read. I notice that they do that sometimes.
    A minor error I suppose.


    3. It''s a pain if two characters are talking at the same time and two different
    subtitles display on the screen representing what each character is saying. Reading
    two subtitles at the same time isn''t the easiest thing to do, it gets confusing
    so you may have to stop and read them which for me personally throws me for a
    loop. Especially if it''s two character that you aren''t familiar with. Japanese
    voices in more than one character sometimes sound the same and it''s hard to differentiate.
    Example, two female characters with really high pitch voices.


    4. This may not be a big issue but there are typos sometimes. Simple typos, Yes
    - where you will still know what the word is but even so, I like things neat and
    in order and I have OCD, so a typo tends to slightly throw me off and annoy me
    a bit.


    5. This isn''t a big issue as well but subtitles may not show up while a character
    is talking. A rare case I assume because I haven''t seen it happen at all, but
    I witnessed it happen first hand, particularly in One Piece. I don''t know the
    exact episode but it happened during the Dressrosa arc. Once that moment happened,
    I assume what the character was saying or what they were talking about given the
    dialogue beforehand. Even so that throws me off and it could very well throw other
    people off as well. Some more than others but nevertheless. Yes, I know and understand
    that mistakes happen, but still.


    6. Translations can (sometimes) suck compared to the dub. There are many cases
    and examples, Specifically in Naruto part 1. I won''t go into each and every example
    as I don''t remember them but even Shikamaru''s "what a drag" in the sub initially
    turns into "utterly bothersome" I remember seeing that the very first time Shikamaru
    says that. Shikamaru''s "what a drag" is more iconic. The more he said "what a
    drag" in the sub, it eventually turned into what a drag, but that just shows how
    dull the translations are.


    7. What''s said in the dub can sometimes be clearer, funnier and overall just
    sounds better than in the sub. Prime example, on Attack on Titan season 3 episode
    11, Sasha told a guy at the table about a girl liking him: "Because she is a thirsty
    girl and she thinks you''re a tall glass of water. " in the dub, whereas in the
    sub she says "Why? ''Cuz you two are. . . You know?". Now which one is funnier?
    That''s my point right there. That was dull and boring compared to what she said
    in the dub.


    One could argue that you can get used to sub, by just watching and reading the
    subtitles will become second nature and you won''t even realize you''re reading,
    but even still. It can be too much of a hassle. Not everyone can multitask or
    do something like that so easily. I watch sub and I''m used to it since I have
    no other choice but to watch but I don''t find it fun to watch.


    Those are the reasons why I never find the enjoyment or the appeal to sub. I''m
    in no way shape or form bashing sub or bashing people who watch sub at all. I''m
    just a dub person overall.


    And can you answer my theory: "_Please correct me if I''m wrong: There are people
    who grew up watching anime in dub (like myself) so they will be used to it and
    naturally watch other anime in dub. The same goes for people who may have grew
    up watching anime in sub so of course they are going to be used to it as well.
    If they watch an anime in dub they are going to feel weird watching it and it
    won''t feel right or normal."_


    I really want to know what you think about that. I''ve always wondered about if
    that''s true or not for a really long time. Maybe you could confirm if it is or
    not. If you are unsure, then let me know.

  content: 'I will rebut the points that I found compelling.


    > 1. Dub is simply easier to watch.


    It''s easier to watch for you. I would even agree that it''s easier for most people.
    But the fact that we''re even geeky enough to have this debate means that we''re
    on in the average category of anime watchers. This wouldn''t even be a debate
    for the casual watcher. I would say that it''s closer to 50/50.


    Semantically speaking, Japanese people would find sub easier to watch. small point,
    but made it just for fun.


    > 5. This isn''t a big issue as well but subtitles may not show up while a character
    is talking.


    This definitely happens a lot of fringe anime but is not a problem on a large
    scale. I do concede this advantage to dub though.


    > 6. Translations can (sometimes) suck compared to the dub.


    I anticipate and lightly addressed this argument in my last statement. The audio
    translations are not any better than the subtitles. If we''re being technical,
    the subtitles tend to be more accurate. Using your Naruto example. The phrase
    "what a drag" was not a direct translation, but rather something that was put
    in to replace the more boring phrase as you put it. An anime purist, which I am
    not, would be vehemently against this. I, as a linguistics enthusiast, would say
    that the Japanese phrasing is entertaining in it''s own right.


    > 7. What''s said in the dub can sometimes be clearer, funnier and overall just
    sounds better than in the sub.


    That''s a category error. A sound cannot sound better than a word. You should
    be comparing the Japanese sounds made, which I find quite entertaining. This actually
    lets me shamelessly plug a point I wanted to bring up. After watching enough Sub,
    one is able to pick out certain phrases and tones to draw context from the anime.
    This context does not always transfer over to the dub which is why dub anime is
    notoriously unemotional and it''s also one reason why people say anime is generic
    and cookie cutter sometimes.


    > And can you answer my theory: "_Please correct me if I''m wrong: There are people
    who grew up watching anime in dub (like myself) so they will be used to it and
    naturally watch other anime in dub. The same goes for people who may have grew

    If they watch an anime in dub they are going to feel weird watching it and it
    won''t feel right or normal."_


    So this might just be because I''m old, but everyone my age grew up watching dub
    because there was no internet (or later on, no good internet) to get any sub.
    Every anime either came from a VCR tape.(Those black plastic rectangles with white
    wheels in them that your parents gave you as legos as a kid.) or on Cable. (This
    thing that was like Netflix mixed with a car radio.) So I actually went from watching
    Dub to Sub quite easily. Which brings me to my next point.


    Watching dub is nice because you get to be ahead on the story line. Sometimes
    months ahead. This is actually the reason I started watching sub.

  content: '> "But the fact that we''re even geeky enough to have this debate means

    Aren''t dubs easier to watch for you too? I mean, I''m sure they are. One could
    argue that some people just love to read. I love reading too but in this specific
    format in entertainment? Distracting, I''d rather focus on the screen alone, like
    any other show or movie that isn''t anime. By "average category of anime watchers"
    do you mean the people who watch sub and understands the essence of it? If so,
    I agree with that. I am aware that people who are experienced anime watchers who''ve
    seen tons of anime are more than likely sub watchers. There are also the ones
    who watch both sub and dub. It''s rare to find someone who is a dubber. I guess
    I fit in that category. Also, people who are new to anime and getting into it
    for the first time tend lean to dub for obvious reasons.


    > "Japanese people would find sub easier to watch."


    This helps my argument. If this wasn''t meant to help, then explain. Just as Japanese
    people would find sub easier to watch, American people/people who speak English
    would find dub easier to watch. You don''t see Japanese people watching dub anime
    with Japanese subtitles and praising it, while disliking sub anime. I know this
    may or may not make sense to you or the people viewing the debate since anime
    originated from Japan, so it probably wouldn''t make any sense that a Japanese
    person would watch a dub anime rather than sub (Japanese audio which is their
    language), but the statement you made suggests that a Japanese person could possibly
    watch dub anime and perhaps hypothetically enjoy it more than sub.


    I did notice that you said "Semantically speaking", so I think you were joking?
    If I took it too serious, then sorry. Enlighten me.


    **Translations**


    I''m unsure if you seen Death note, but I will use it as my example here. I will
    use these two phrases that are closely similar. Pick which one you think is slightly
    better. I won''t even say which is sub and which is dub. After you either choose
    phrase 1 or phrase 2, I will reveal to you in the next round which is which, and
    explain translations being a bit better (at times) not all of the time.


    > The character L, says this:

    >

    > 1. "I have to sit like this."

    > 2. "It''s not like I want to sit like this."


    Two sentences that mean the same thing, but the wording is a little different.
    Which phrase do you like better? This might be pretty easy for you to guess which
    is sub and dub, so feel free to choose in the next round if you''d like. I''ll
    keep what you said, _"not a direct translation, but rather something that was
    put in to replace the more boring phrase as you put it."_ in mind for the next
    round.


    **Sound**


    From my experience in the anime community, I''ve come across many people (mainly
    sub watchers of course) who admit that Death note in the dub is great and is done
    very well. Some even preferring the dub version over the sub.\

    Another example, L''s scream was much better in the dub than in the sub. Check
    them both out and compare.


    > <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSMtT5rQeQU> (Dub)\

    > <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwFszVk_QRw> (Sub) **Skip to 1:15**


    In the dub, you can hear the fear and terror in his voice, he was actually frightened.\

    In the sub, there was an initial yell, but he mostly gasped and it was just silent.
    There was barely any work put into that.\

    I''d say between those two, the dub was better and more compelling.


    One could argue that "most subs are superior (I hate the superior argument) and
    they convey emotion better" but this scene alone shows that dubs can be just as
    good if not better, and they should be respected more. As time passes, I notice
    people are starting to appreciate dubs.


    > "A sound cannot sound better than a word. You should be comparing the Japanese
    sounds made, which I find quite entertaining."


    A word cannot be better than a sound. Which in turn sums up my whole argument.
    Dub in my book displays the importance of sound and the words being said, which
    are one in the same, since there are no subtitles being shown. By your logic,
    sound is better than a word since, from my understanding. sub watchers value the
    voices of the characters the most. This means that the voices will overshadow
    the words. Realistically speaking, reading words on a screen isn''t a wow factor,
    they don''t hold much weight and they aren''t the source of entertainment. Yeah
    you need the words to help you understand what''s being said, but the voices of
    the characters are the main entertainment. But let''s briefly compare sounds made
    in the sub and the dub. I do admit, the sounds made from characters in Japanese
    are pretty good but in English, it can be just as good. Another thing, Japanese
    VA''s can be way too over the top and annoying, sometimes hurting my ears. It''s
    like there is screeching at time to time.


    Another reason I connect more with dub is that I can actually hear the emphasis
    and sarcasm in character''s voices. You can''t really hear that from sub, which
    ruins the fun of it. Yes, there''s italics in the subtitles representing an emphasis
    but like I said, it doesn''t hold much weight. This proves that a word is not
    better than a sound. What I take from this is that watching sub lowers the importance
    of the actual words you understand and you can become misguided with the Japanese
    voices and get confused without even knowing it.


    > "Watching dub is nice because you get to be ahead on the story line. Sometimes
    months ahead. This is actually the reason I started watching sub."


    Did you mean to say watching \*sub? I''m sure you did. But yeah, I agree with
    you on that all the way. That''s the only advantage of sub to me. You get to be
    ahead and up to date on everything, like for One punch man S2 I wanted to wait
    for the dub so bad, but because of the hype I went ahead and watched the sub unfortunately,
    but nevertheless S2 is amazing. However, I watched One punch mean season 1 in
    dub and I was used to it. Oh well.

    In fact. I prefer a challenge. You speak about entertainment being a bad medium
    for reading. What if studying is entertaining for me? I mean, we are on a debate
    site, lol.


    When I say average anime watchers, I wasn''t implying that anime watchers would
    necessarily watch sub more. My point is we don''t ask who watches what. We ask
    what are they trying to get out of it.


    I think most English people will be dubbers. If we''re being technical, every
    Japanese fan is a dubber. Just throwing that out there. Japanese voices are still
    dubs because they''re being superimposed over images.


    Well it supports that Japanese people would do better understanding the language.
    But not specifically for sub. There''s two way we can divide this and we need
    to pick one. We either say "sub is sub and dub is dub" and in that case. The Japanese
    are watching subs so it supports me. If we say "dub and sub are relative to the
    watcher" Then we tie on that point because I can espouse sub for English and sub
    for japs and you can do the same with dub, but in this case we muddy the waters
    for other points. So how are we doing this?


    On the translation point. I''m assuming the second one is sub because it seems
    counter intuitive to how an English person would say it. But I can understand
    both just fine. Depending on the context, I could make the English one sound just
    as strange. What if he says "I have to sit like this" but in the context, he''s
    saying "I have to" in the sense of he feels like he has to because it helps him
    focus. In that case, the Japanese translation works better because he doesn''t
    literally have to. Either way. It''s not about intelligibility for me personally.
    for me it''s about appreciating linguistics. This is of course subjective. Love
    me some death note either.


    Incidentally, I would probably prefer death note dubbed because I watched it before
    switching to sub and I''m used to the voices in that case. Also. I don''t invariably
    choose subbed. I will generally pick dubbed unless I really want to enjoy the
    anime. If I''m just browsing it to see if it''s good. I''ll go dub and then maybe
    switch to sub on a rewatch if it happens.


    Good, so we''re in agreement that a word and a sound can''t be called better or
    worse. That''s win/win for us.


    You mention voice emphasis. this is funny because I would make this argument from
    my side. You only hear the English emphasis that the voice actor inserted. I get
    to hear the Japanese voice emphasis and get to hear what the mangakai wanted me
    to hear. (if it was not manga based, then the director instead of the mangakai
    )

    You have a point. For me, it just depends on the circumstances. Reading debates
    are entertaining but I wouldn''t want to read while watching something at the
    same time.


    > "Well it supports that Japanese people would do better understanding the language.

    All of this confused me, I''ll take it in the best way I can. I''m on the side
    of "sub is sub and dub is dub" Japanese people are watching sub because it''s
    easier for them, which would support the point of Americans watching dub making
    it easier for them. If I''m going in the wrong direction, then guide me and explain
    further.


    **Translations**


    > "I''m assuming the second one is sub because it seems counter intuitive to how
    an English person would say it."


    > 1. "I have to sit like this." - Sub version.

    > 2. "It''s not like I want to sit like this." - Dub version.


    The second one is actually the dub one. The first one is sub. Your point: _What
    if he says "I have to sit like this" but in the context, he''s saying "I have
    to" in the sense of he feels like he has to because it helps him focus. In that
    case, the Japanese translation works better because he doesn''t literally have
    to._ -- is exactly how I feel. In other words, the English translation works better
    because he doesn''t literally have to. I like phrase 2 better than phrase 1. I
    think we can both agree that, "I have to sit like this." is more forced and boring
    compared to the other phrase. "It''s not like I want to sit like this" is better
    because it has a slight comedic tone to it and like you said, it shows the option
    that L could sit normally but it just wouldn''t work because his deductive reasoning
    would drop.


    **Word and sound**


    Understood. I''ll tie this into the translation point. I probably should have
    kept this simple and made this point earlier, so let''s scratch the word/sound
    thing. When I said, \_"\__What''s said in the dub can sometimes be clearer, funnier
    and overall just sounds better than in the sub."_ I probably should have just
    said "the translations are much better". Like the AOT example, the words that
    were said in the dub was much better than what was translated in the sub, not
    the actual sound of the character''s voice. The voice is good and it was hilarious
    but it was the actual translation that wasn''t all that compared to the dub. Especially
    me watching both the sub and dub version of the episode.

    case are meant for the person who can''t understand the dubbing. Technically.
    The Japanese watch dubs because there are no subtitles and they''re listening
    to a dub of the original voice actor.


    On translation, My point is mostly that anything can be said more than one way
    and whether or not it fits depends on the language it is being implied in and
    the context of the situation. Sometimes, the Japanese one won''t fit so well,
    but that could also be in part because it''s responding to another mistranslated
    dub in the first place. Plus the translation is never going to be 100 percent
    right because, of course, Japanese does not have the same grammar flow that we
    have. We use VSO and I think they us OVS.


    That''s mostly the extent of my contention. I think we''ve covered everything
    that is relevant. I''ll just extent my previous arguments and call this a wrap.

    > Subs in this case are meant for the person who can''t understand the dubbing.


    Is this the case for Japanese people or American people? Or both. For Japanese
    people, that would make a lot of sense. For English people, that wouldn''t make
    sense since that person speaks English so they would understand the dub since
    they know what''s being said. Unless, by "can''t understand the dub" you mean
    not understanding or resonating with the voices but connecting more with the Japanese
    people? If so, then alright.


    > Technically. The Japanese watch dubs because there are no subtitles and they''re
    listening to a dub of the original voice actor.


    Define Japanese dub/original.\

    Is it called "sub" or could it also be called "dub"? Because what I got from that
    statement is how can a Japanese person watch dub (Eng. audio) they don''t understand
    English. Unless you are talking about a Japanese person watching the original
    meaning Japanese audio with no subtitles? Is that possible? Sorry if I confused
    you. I was confused on these points. Hope to get some clarification so I understand.
    It''s good to learn more about this.


    > We use VSO and I think they us OVS.


    What are VSOs and OVS?


    In closing:


    Dub is better to me because as I said, I dislike watching anime while dealing
    with the subtitles. I''d like to focus just on the anime especially if there is
    a lot of action or fights. It''s much more convenient. I connect more with what
    the characters are saying because I know what''s being said. All of my points
    in R2 still stand, those are all of the reasons.


    Thanks for the debate. I never debate with my friends, in fact I don''t like it
    because it could get heated, an argument might erupt and it''s just awkward. I
    know you and I''m familiar with you so I didn''t expect it you to accept this
    but nevertheless I''m glad this went well.


    May the best person win.

    No, the version that the Japanese watch is not called subs because it doesn''t
    have subtitles. It only has voice dubbing just like English versions. The only
    difference is the language that is being dubbed.


    VSO is an acronym used in linguistics for Verb, Subject, Object. The arrangement
    of the acronym tells you have that language generally arranges their sentences.


    I''ll land this plane gently a just reiterate to the voters that the answer to
    this is ultimately subjective and if I''m not mistaken, my opponent agrees. This
    is going to have to come down to what the voters think are the best standards
    for judging the preferability of each side.


    Good Debate.

    \ like to thank all of you for reading it. I also encourage you to vote afterwards.\n\
    \nIn this debate, I will attempt to emphasize one central point: that killing\
    \ a baby is a bad thing. Perhaps I will have more difficulty than I expect in\
    \ establishing this point, as the killing of babies is often convenient to justify.\
    \ I expect we will hear many arguments that justify murder for the purpose of\
    \ economic convenience. I expect I we will also see babies and human beings referred\
    \ to as something other than babies and human beings. But if we are to discuss\
    \ abortion, it should be defined in simple terms, and abortion is best defined\
    \ as killing a baby. When a woman goes to a clinic for an abortion, the doctor's\
    \ job is to kill the baby, and if the baby is somehow alive by the end of the\
    \ procedure, an abortion has not been performed.\n\nTherefore, I hold that abortion\
    \ constitutes the killing of an innocent human being. But when do human beings\
    \ become human beings? The pro-choice camp does not provide us with a singular\
    \ answer, but science does. In Essentials of Human Embryology, Keith Moore writes\
    \ the following \\[[1](<https://www.princeton.edu/~prolife/articles/embryoquotes2.html#:~:text=Life%20Begins%20at%20Fertilization%20with%20the%20Embryo's%20Conception&text=%22Development%20of%20the%20embryo%20begins,together%20they%20form%20a%20zygote.%22&text=%22Human%20development%20begins%20after%20the,known%20as%20fertilization%20(conception).>)\\\
    ]:\n\n> Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or\
    \ germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception). Fertilization\
    \ is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon)\
    \ with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the\
    \ haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes\
    \ to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid\
    \ cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being.\n\nIn Medical Embryology,\
    \ Jan Langman writes:\n\n> The development of a human being begins with fertilization,\
    \ a process by which two highly specialized cells, the spermatozoon from the male\
    \ and the oocyte from the female, unite to give rise to a new organism, the zygote.\n\
    \nNote that the aforementioned zygote has its own unique human DNA. A Japanese\
    \ zygote implanted in a Ukranian woman will always be Japanese, not Ukranian,\
    \ because the identity of a fetus is based on his or her genetic code, not that\
    \ of the body they occupy. Furthermore, if the woman\u2019s body is the only one\
    \ involved in a pregnancy, then for most of the pregnancy, she must have two brains,\
    \ two circulatory systems, two noses, four legs, two sets of fingerprints, and\
    \ two skeletal systems. Half the time she must also have male sex organs. To deny\
    \ that abortion is killing a baby, my opponent must reject the overwhelming scientific\
    \ consensus that life begins at conception, agreed on by 95% of biologists \\\
    [[2](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3211703)\\].\n\nThe most\
    \ common method of abortion involves sucking the fetus out of the womb with a\
    \ vacuum hose \\[[3](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/abortion/in-clinic-abortion-procedures)\\\
    ]. Another common method, known as D&E, involves ripping the baby's limbs off\
    \ and removing them from the womb one body part at a time \\[[4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g46hlT_2804)\\\
    ] \\[[5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1FH_Cmxy2k)\\]. Dr. Martin Haskell,\
    \ an abortionist, states the following \\[[6](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-1996-03-27/html/CREC-1996-03-27-pt1-PgH2895.htm)\\\
    ]:\n\n> The more common late-term abortion methods are the classic D&E and induction.\
    \ \\[Induction\\] usually involves injecting digoxin or another substance into\
    \ the fetal heart to kill it, then dilating the cervix and inducing labor...Classic\
    \ D&E is accomplished by dismembering the fetus inside the uterus with instruments\
    \ and removing the pieces through an adequately dilated cervix.\n\nTo argue that\
    \ abortion is not killing an innocent human being, also known as murder, my opponent\
    \ must establish that an unborn child is not human, that an unborn child is not\
    \ innocent, or that abortion does not involve killing an unborn child.\n"

    and still win. But I will keep arguing for fun, especially since the character
    limit no longer applies.


    First, I find it odd that my opponent agrees on using the moral definition of
    murder and then uses the legal one anyway. This definition doesn''t necessarily
    even help their case because abortion is legally classified as murder in some
    places. Killing slaves used to be legal. Legality does not impact whether something
    is moral or not, so a moral definition should not depend on the law and change
    from one country to another. Therefore, I think we can reject my opponent''s definition
    as self-contradictory.


    A better definition will define murder as killing an innocent human being, regardless
    of immutable characteristics such as sex, race, sexual orientation, etc. My opponent
    has not contested that abortion fits this description, and so far, it''s clearly
    the superior definition used in this debate. My opponent asks how the unborn child
    is alive, which I already answered in my opening; the unborn child has a distinct
    set of DNA. A skin cell has the same DNA as whoever it belongs to, proving that
    it is part of that person''s body and not a separate organism. We know that an
    unborn child is a distinct organism and that they are biologically human. Because
    an unborn child is a human being, killing them is wrong.


    Cells are parts of organisms or organisms themselves \[[1](https://www.britannica.com/science/cell-biology)\].
    Different organisms have distinct DNA \[[2](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/dna-is-a-structure-that-encodes-biological-6493050/#:~:text=Although%20each%20organism''s%20DNA%20is,arranged%20that%20differs%20among%20individuals)\].
    Because the cells that compose an unborn child have distinct DNA, they compose
    a distinct organism. So when my opponent says that unborn children behave like
    cells and not like organisms, he is providing you with false information.


    A baby is a young child, or a human at an early stage of development. Because
    we agree that killing babies is wrong (and murder, too, as I think my opponent
    conceded) the scientific evidence resolves the question posed in this debate.
    Abortion involves killing an innocent human being, and it is murder from the point
    of conception.

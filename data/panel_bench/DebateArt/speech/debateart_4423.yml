    I see we are starting off with personal attacks for absolutely no reason. This
    is my first time using this site, I accepted the debate last night, you sent me
    a direct message this morning asking if I was a timewaster, then blocked me within
    2 hours before I could even respond. Although I am curious what made me seem like
    a timewaster to you when you know nothing about me.


    > The Bible contains many contradictions.


    I agree.


    > ''Matthew 27:5- Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
    and went and hanged himself.''\

    Again, I fully agree the bible has contradictions, but in your prompt you stated
    _"I believe that the Quran has 0 contradictions and the Bible has many. My position
    is this and_ **_I want a challenger who thinks the Quran has 1 or more contradictions_**
    _in it or the Bible has 0 or both."_ I believe that the Quran has contradictions,
    not that the bible has none.


    **Quran Contradiction- The creation of man**


    My initial argument will be centered around a single contradiction in the Quran.
    The creation of man.


    _"Created man, out of a clot of congealed blood" - (96:2)_\

    _"We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape" -_ (15:26)\

    _"The similitude of jesus before Allah is that of Adam; He created him from dust,
    then said to him: ''Be''. And he was." -_ (3:59)\

    _"He has created man from a sperm-drop; and behold this same (man) becomes an
    open disputer"_ - (16:4)\

    If we are going to look at both of these religious texts through an equal lens
    of literal interpretation, then they both are chalked full of contradictions.
    I would argue that contradictions in a concept as foundational in all religions
    as the creation of life are much more significant than contradictions that could
    easily be attributed to memory decay from different authors with different perspectives
    of a single event, such as the death of Judas.

    You easily got this from the internet because I have seen this one before,


    The first man, Adam (AS) was created from dust/clay/mud\

    A sperm drop is a stage of how babies are born\

    The clot is a stage of how babies are born\

    Life originates from water\

    It has been answered hundreds of times, at least give me something better!


    Con has not fulfilled the challenge of giving a single contradiction from the
    Quran.

    I don''t believe that you have shown that this isn''t a contradiction if you interpret
    the text literally. If we aren''t going to interpret the text literally as it
    is written, then any contradiction can be explained away with symbolism. If the
    Quran literally says man was created out of a clot of congealed blood, then later
    says he was created from clay and mud, then later dust, then later from a sperm
    drop, that is an absolute contradiction unless you begin to interpret the words
    in a way other than they were written.


    Also, it is the contradiction I am most familiar with, I had to use the internet
    to find the supporting passages to cite them, as I''m sure you did for your citations
    too. As I am not a religious expert, or even a religious person, I am having to
    research passages to support my claim that the Quran has contradictions.


    **Quran Contradiction 2 - Allah''s perception of time**


    Allah''s perception of time is cited multiple times as being 1,000 years, then
    later being cited at 50,000 years.


    _"A day in the sight of the Lord is like a thousand years of your reckoning."
    -_ (22:47)


    _"To Him, on a Day, the space whereof will be a thousand years of your reckoning."
    -_ (32:5)\

    _"The angels and the spirit ascend unto him in a day the measure whereof is fifty
    thousand years." -_ (70:4)


    **Quran Contradiction 3 - Flat Earth**


    The Quran clearly states that the earth is flat. While this isn''t the text contradicting
    itself, the text is contradicting what we know to be scientific fact.


    _"Allah was sure that the Earth is flat like a carpet and that mountains are there
    to anchor the earth so that the Earth does not shake with us. Allah is really
    an excellent scientist." -_ (78:7)

    \nThere is another verse I would like you to pay attention to.\n\n**23:14- Then\
    \ We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, and We made the clot into a lump\
    \ \\[of flesh\\], and We made \\[from\\] the lump, bones, and We covered the bones\

    \ so on. There is no contradiction here. 2 verses are talking about the first\

    \ This is not to say the religion is flawed or that any religion is, they are\

    \ is how these new wavelengths will affect the skin.** The human body has between\
    \ two million to four million sweat ducts. Dr.\nBen-Ishai of Hebrew University,\
    \ Israel explains that our sweat ducts\nact like \u201C_an array of helical antennas\
    \ when exposed to these wavelengths,_\u201D meaning that we become more conductive.\
    \ A recent New York study which experimented with 60GHz waves stated that \u201C\
    _the\nanalyses of penetration depth show that more than 90% of the\ntransmitted\
    \ power is absorbed in the epidermis and dermis layer._\u201D\\\n**The effects\

  content: '**Burden of Proof:**\

    Pro is the one making a profound claim, to which he needs to support

    with profound evidence (not YouTube opinions, and not the same conspiracy site
    repeatedly).

    I shall show why any evidence he does present is insufficient to prove his case.


    **0. NYC:**\

    Numbered prior to refuting pro''s case, as it is my foundational counter case.


    That NYC (or [sections thereof](https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/5g-home-internet-is-now-live-in-new-york-city-is-coming-to-15-other-markets-at-just-50-a-month/))

    is not a post-apocalyptic wasteland, disproves the death-grid assertion.


    **1. Effects on the Skin:**\

    No fatalities.


    While they _may_ be reviewing _possibilities_, they have yet to connect even

    one case of skin cancer to internet exposure.


    **2. Effects on the Eyes:**\

    5th generation internet is not microwave ovens. Yes,

    experiments with humans in microwave ovens are fatal, but the lack of New

    Yorkers [exploding](https://youtu.be/Z1M7h1i-KXo?t=12) has already proved there

    to be no valid comparison.


    **3. Effects on the Brain:**\

    All that has been offered here is more fear mongering assertions. The

    primary site claims there''s various studies, but said studies most often prove

    to be just more of its'' own articles to sell people expensive doodads which

    will in no way improve their lives. I''m sorry pro fell for the scam of a snake-oil
    salesman, but his heavily plagiarized case implies that more than anything else.

    With 5G internet already in [parts of New York City](https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/5g-home-internet-is-now-live-in-new-york-city-is-coming-to-15-other-markets-at-just-50-a-month/),

    is firmly refuted.

    the effects they just have not tied there symptoms to the internet.for example
    a 5g internet tower was placed next to a fire stations all of the fire men started
    to have migraine headaches. but luckily they were able to figure out that it was
    the 5g tower placed right next to them and they were able to get a bill to remove
    it


    if the fire men did not tie there headaches to the 5g towers would we hear of
    it. if they are getting sick i bet you they have not connected the dots and figured
    out that it is the 5g internet doing it to them. plus they towers have not been
    installed for that long and the towers have been turned off for a long time to.
    sorry for the late uploads hideing from 5g. i don''t think if the newyorkers got
    sick they would tie it to 5g

    As hilarious as your claim is, that they died but are carrying on their normal
    lives having not noticed dying yet, you have not found any evidence to suggest
    it. Even the claimed migraines have no news articles, no doctors visits, not even
    the word of a single firefighter having a headache... All you have is a video
    of a crazy woman at a public hearing, repeating old conspiracies theories about
    sperm counts.


    The article is both fictional (tank warfare, but the tank was invisible so no
    one else in the world knows about it), and produced by a certifiably insane author
    whom claims things like [NASA denies we ever went to the moon](https://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/nasadmits-we-never-went-to-the-moon/).
    Such ramblings are evidence of an unhinged mind, not of anything within the real
    world.

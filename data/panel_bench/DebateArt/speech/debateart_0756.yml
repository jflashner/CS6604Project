    \ \"Strong atheist\". There are many flaws in the Dawkins Scale which is why I\

    \n(2) \"The Universe began to exist. (Supported by ... past-eternal \\[4\\]) \"\
    \n\nThe big bang did happen but we know that no god created it, As I explained\
    \ in my opening statement. I will paste it here again: \"We understand how the\
    \ big bang works. We know that space and time came to be at the beginning of the\
    \ Universe(aka Time did not exist before the big bang). Therefore, if there is\
    \ a god, then that god did not create the universe because it did not have time\
    \ to create the universe. \" I am paraphrasing Stephen Hawking, a famous cosmologist(an\
    \ actual expert on the big bang. In fact his work on Singularity along with Sir\
    \ Roger Penrose actually led to our final understanding of the big bang). (2)\n\
    \n(3) \"Whatever begins to exist has a cause\" and \"The Universe has a cause\"\
    \\\nThis is the fallacy of composition(when one infers that something is true\
    \ of the whole from the fact that it is true of some part of the whole. For example:\
    \ \"This tire is made of rubber, Therefore the vehicle to which it is a part is\
    \ also made of rubber. \") Just because everything in the Universe has a cause,\
    \ It does not mean that the Universe also must have a cause. TO BE CLEAR: I am\
    \ not saying that there is no cause behind the Universe rather I am pointing out\
    \ that you fail to make the case that the Universe does indeed have a cause. That\
    \ which can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence.\n\
    \n(4) \"Whatever begins to exist has a cause\"\\\nIf I grant you that \"whatever\
    \ being to exist has a cause\", then it follows that the creator of the Universe\
    \ must have a cause too. So what created the creator? And what created the Creator\
    \ of the creator?\" The usual response would be something along the lines of:\"\
    Well God is eternal and has no beginning.Thus it has no cause\"\n\nWell, this\
    \ is an extraordinary claim and the burden of proof is on you to prove that(Prove\
    \ that there is a God and one that is eternal). The Kalam cannot prove that at\
    \ all). Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. If you can prove\
    \ that, I would suggest that you write a paper and get it peer reviewed. This\
    \ will bring you fame and a lot of money. It will debunk the biggest discoveries\

    \ does nothing whatever to disprove\na God that is not bound by the physical laws\

    Pro goes on to argue (I will not cite the whole argument due\nto the character\
    \ limit) that \u201CNo God is required at any step\u201D because the God\nof the\
    \ gaps argument has been used in the past and has been replaced by\nscientific\

    > two possibilities: Either there is no god or there is a god but that god is\n\
    > useless, It does nothing.\u201D\n\nThis argument again does not show\nthat an\
    \ omnipotent God does not exist at all, merely that some explanations\nhave been\

  content: 'CON argues that God is not bounded by the physical time-space laws. This
    makes no sense. Whenever someone says, something is real, they have a physically
    measurable way of demonstrating that thing. If I say, this basketball is real.
    I can hold it in my hands, I can send you a photo of it etc... When it comes to
    more complicated matters like black holes, worm holes etc, we have mathematical
    equations and models that directly explain observations we make. There are physical(bounded
    by space and time) ways to demonstrate these things we describe as "real/exists/etc".


    However, if we go with the way CON is defining God, there is no way of measuring
    that. This is known as the unfalsifiability fallacy(Defining God in such a way
    that it is impossible to show it does not exist). (1)\

    This exact same argument that CON used can be used for this example:


    There is a giant eternal unicorn that exists. However, it does not exist in the
    Universe. Just like CON''s God, it exists outside the physical time-space laws.
    Prove that this Unicorn does not exist. It is impossible for you to do it. However,
    as I am the one who brought the Unicorn argument forward, the burden of proof(2)
    is on me to prove its existence. Similarly, if CON argues that there is a God
    that exists, the burden of proof is on CON to prove that there is a God that exists
    and that that God exists outside of space and time. I have no idea how anyone
    can prove that anything exists outside of space and time. Doing so, CON is sure
    to receive money and fame since they will then debunk the fundamental laws of
    physics.


    When we say something exists, it is implied that we mean it exists within space
    and time. It makes no sense for something to exist outside of it.\

    If we define God as existing outside of space and time, how can we demonstrate
    it? We only have tools available within space and time. We know of nothing that
    exists outside such parameters. If your God exists outside the laws of physics,
    then it is physically impossible for your god to exist.


    "This argument again does not show that an omnipotent God does not exist at all"


    This is a strawman fallacy(2) as CON misrepresents my position and argues against
    this misrepresentation. I said that I have concluded that the simplest explanation
    is that there is no god but I could be proven wrong. I see no reason to believe
    in a god and I see reasons to believe there is no god. Therefore, I believe there
    is no god. It is impossible to know for a fact that there is no god for one simple
    reason: There are millions of definitions that people have made up for the god
    they believe in. For me to prove that there is no god, I will have to refute every
    single one of them here.


    "Furthermore, God ... incorrect."


    This here is an appeal to popularity)(4). A simpler way of phrasing it would be
    "All these people agree with me therefore I must be right". Many people believe
    the Earth is flat, yet that does not make it true. I can use that argument back
    on CON. You believe in a God that exists beyond space and time. however, millions
    of people (like many hindus and many christians/etc...) believe in a god that
    exists within space and time. Therefore, you must be wrong. This is why the appeal
    to popularity is a bad argument. The truth value of a claim is unaffected by how
    many people believe in it.


    To conclude, CON misrepresented my position(and argued against this misrepresentation)
    and defined a god whose existence can neither be proven true nor false. Let us
    watch him now prove his unfalsifiable god.

  content: 'I am not a physicist, your contribution (that there are things that exist
    outside space and time), if they were true, would refute most of cosmology. If
    you are right, you deserve fame and money. So go write that paper and get it peer
    reviewed. Hopefully by next year, I''ll see your name being mentioned in the news.
    I''ll keep an eye out.


    My opponent seems to master the art of commiting strawman fallacies. Right from
    the get go, his rebuttal of my rebuttal to the Kalam is this:


    "This ... space "


    Firstly, the Kalam only aims to show that there is an uncaused cause(as I said
    earlier). As I mentioned earlier as well, your conclusion("This cause of the universe
    is what we call God") does not follow from the premises. Hence you committed the
    Non sequitur fallacy(your argument is invalid). I wish you would be honest in
    representing my argument. Right now, I am only repeating myself since you refuted
    arguments I never made. Read the last two sentences that CON wrote. Those are
    obfuscating language(or a "word salad" in lay terms).


    CON wrote a lot and cited famous names so we think CON is smart. However, this
    whole diatribe can be summarised as follows: "PRO is right that the Kalam only
    aims to prove an uncaused cause. However, this big guy said something about a
    Prime Mover(another term for uncaused cause) and that is called God. " See? According
    to CON, Kalam''s uncaused cause = Aquinas'' Prime Mover = God. I can agree that
    the uncaused cause and the prime mover are very similar. Kalam is an argument
    that stemmed from Aquinas'' unmoved mover. They are different but the arguments
    follow the same structure.


    However, how does Prime Mover/Uncaused Cause = God? CON does not make that link.
    An uncaused cause/unmoved mover can be energy, fairies living beyond space and
    time/etc... With a good imagination, countless examples can be found that could
    potentially be uncaused causes/prime movers. He avoided responding to my argument
    and repeated what we already said but he used complicated language to sound smart.


    A proper analogy to that would be a kid in high school has to write an essay of
    1000 words. The kid is lazy therefore he uses a lot of words to explain little
    so he catches up on the word limit.


    "This relies on the ... omnipotent being."


    This is getting tiring but CON does not stop misrepresenting me or simply ignoring
    my earlier rebuttals. I already said that it makes no sense to say that something
    exists outside of space and time(outside the physical laws). If something exists
    outside the laws of physics, then it is physically impossible for that thing to
    exist.


    "My opponent is attacking ... cause."


    It seems clear that CON does not understand the Kalam Cosmological Argument. I
    would suggest listening to the theologian William Lane Craig on how that argument
    works ". You don''t understand the premises of your own argument. I cannot educate
    you on theology. Go do your research. I don''t have enough characters left to
    explain such entry level philosophy. It would take me 400 more characters to explain
    the Kalam to you. I have other arguments to respond to.


    The last two paragraphs deserve to be read multiple times. CON misused the Kalam
    to provide evidence for a god. I pointed out that the conclusion did not follow
    from the premises(Kalam only proved uncaused cause) and that CON still needed
    to demonstrate that their conclusion does not follow. CON clearly does not understand
    the burden of proof. I will try and explain that.\

    The Kalam aims to provide evidence for a god. Therefore CON, you are making a
    case for a god. You have a burden of proof\

    I said "I believe there is no god" so I have a burden of proof too. Hence why
    I made this long paragraph at the beginning.


    We BOTH have a burden of proof.


    To conclude, CON failed to refute my arguments, made many strawman fallacies and
    failed to understand their own arguments.


    The Universe is amazing on its own, we don''t need to add fairy tales to enliven
    it.

    \ me therefore I must be right\"\n\nPro claims that I have argued that because\
    \ many people believe\nin God, therefore God must exist. I have done no such thing.\
    \ I have responded\nto Pro\u2019s claims in round 2 that if God existed he would\
    \ be \u201Cuseless\u201D and \u201Cit\ndoes nothing\u201D and showed that the\
    \ mere existence of a God would be useful as\nhis omnibenevolent nature would\
    \ provide a basis for objective morality which\nmany people base their morality\
    \ on. My argument was simply that the existence\nof God would be useful because\
    \ many people base their morality on him, I have\nmade no assertion whatever that\
    \ this shows that God exists, merely that if he\nexists he would be useful.\n\n\
    **Closing statement:**\\\n**Aside from Pro\u2019s condescending comments, his\
    \ only two arguments against the\nexistence of God were based on the physical\
    \ impossibility of God. The physical\nimpossibility of God does however fail to\
    \ prove that God does not exist since God\nis only bound by logical possibility,\
    \ not by physical possibility. Furthermore,\nPro failed to refute the conception\
    \ of God as the uncaused cause (which Aristotle\nand Aquinas argued for, although\
    \ only Aquinas referred to this as God), which\nis supported by the Kalam cosmological\
    \ argument, which supports a time-less\n(as there was no time prior to the universe)\
    \ and space-less (ditto) uncaused cause.Pro, therefore, failed to fulfil his BoP\
    \ (since he has taken the Pro position and made the assertion \"there is no god\"\
    ) and I have made an argument for the uncaused cause conception of God, which\
    \ falsifies his position and his shifting of the BoP is unsuccessful as it would\
    \ be an argumentum ad ignorantiam to argue that because there is no proof for\
    \ something it does not exist (e.g. we assumed that black swans do not exist...\
    \ until we discovered them in Oceania).**\n\nSources in the comments\n"

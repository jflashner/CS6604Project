  content: '**1: Yoda scared Sidious**


    Right in the beginning of the duel, Sidious tried to flee. This shows that he
    was genuinely concerned Yoda could defeat him or at least do him harm. Yoda showed
    no fear during the duel but Sidious visibly shat his pants about three times.
    First when he tried to flee, second when Yoda sent the spinning senatorial hover-thing
    at him, and third when Yoda blocked and almost reversed his lightning back on
    him.


    **2: Yoda disarmed Sidious**


    The lightsaber combat portion of the duel was relatively short as Yoda was a supreme
    duelist and Sidious could not bare him for long. In the movie, Sidious was not
    shown being disarmed but after a cut to mustafar and back Sidious has no lightsaber
    in hand and instead has fallen back on his force abilities. Even if Yoda had not
    actually disarmed him during the off screen portion of the duel it is still clear
    Yoda was the better swordsman, as he was a true master of the lightsaber whereas
    Sidious saw lightsaber skill as being of little priority in his training as a
    sith.

    **3: Yoda was not overpowered by Sidious**


    In the end of the duel, when Sidious and Yoda were locked in the struggle of the
    force lightning ball, Sidious shat his pants for the third consecutive time when
    he realized he could not overpower Yoda, then was almost overpowered himself.
    In the end, Yoda could not fully defeat the emperor, but he also was not bested
    by any means. Neither of them could hold on any longer, and the energy between
    them dispersed, sending them both flying, and Yoda only flew further due to his
    much smaller size.


    **4: Summary**


    It is safe to say that Yoda came closer to defeating Sidious than Sidious came
    to defeating him. Yoda disarmed Sidious, forced him to empty his bowels in his
    robes 3 times, and nearly overpowered him with the force.

    1. The Point of the Duel\n\nIf the purpose of this fight was sport or recreation\
    \ I could see an argument for Yoda being the points victor. However, this duel\
    \ had a stated purpose by Yoda himself. Before the battle Yoda tells Obi-Wan \"\
    destroy the Sith we must\" \\[1\\]. Yoda does not go the battle Sidious in order\
    \ to show his skills or almost win. He goes there with the express purpose to\
    \ destroy him.\n\n2. The Outcome\n\nObviously Yoda fails in his express purpose.\
    \ He does not destroy Sidious. Sidious reigns for another 30 years after this\
    \ fight. Again, Yoda tells us in his own words how he saw the fight. \"Into exile\
    \ I must go, failed I have\" \\[2\\]. Yoda lost the fight, fled and stated that\
    \ he failed.\n\n3. Ultimate Outcome\\\n   Not only does Yoda lose, he loses so\
    \ badly he never attempts to duel Sidious again. If he was so close to winning\
    \ he would have regrouped and given it another go. He never does. He goes into\
    \ exile for the rest of his life. Yoda lost this Duel and lost it badly.\n\nHe\
    \ did not fulfill his purpose for the fight. He States that he failed and then\
    \ goes into exile to never try it again. Yoda loses.\\\nThank you.\\\n\\[1\\]\

  content: 'Yes, Yoda failed in his mission, but he did better than Sidious in the
    actual fight. He goes into exile not because he lost the fight, but because he
    failed to kill Sidious.\

    Yoda essentially was slightly better than Sidious, but not enough to fully defeat
    him. If you broke down the fight and calculated who was winning, it is clear Yoda
    would have the better numbers. I realize this wasn''t like a boxing match but
    an actual fight to the death, yet it still remains that Yoda was the superior
    fighter.

  content: "**Refutations**\\\n**1. Yoda Was a Better Fighter**\\\nAnargument could\
    \ be made that Yoda was a vwtter fighter however this debate is about who won\
    \ the duel between the two. A superior fighter can lose a single bout to an inferior\
    \ opponent. While Yoda may have gotten some good moments in, in the end, he failed.\

  content: 'Well by your standards of winning neither of them won, because Sidious
    did worse in the fight overall and Yoda ultimately failed to kill him. The only
    way to say either of them won is if you break it down and look at who did better
    overall, otherwise there is no real victor here at all. You can either say it
    was a tie or that Yoda won depending on how you look at it, but the idea that
    Sidious won is based on a superficial appearance of him winning based merely on
    the fact that Yoda was the one that fell off the platform. By your standards Yoda
    would have needed to kill Sidious to be considered the winner but by merely surviving
    Sidious won the fight. These standards are ridiculous and at the end of the day
    Yoda did better in the fight as I''ve already demonstrated.\

    Yoda was disarmed at the last minute but that doesn''t take away from the fact
    that when Sidious was disarmed it was because Yoda was a better swordsman and
    when Yoda was disarmed he immediately proved himself to be slightly more powerful
    than Sidious with the force because it was Sidious shitting his pants and nearly
    being overpowered while Yoda stood strong. Like I said when the lightning ball
    exploded in both of their faces Yoda only flew further because he was smaller
    and lighter, and he was actually on the verge of overpowering Sidious before both
    of them lost control over the energy.


    It also should be noted that the primary reason Yoda went into exile is plot,
    and if ROTS came before ESB it may not have happened that way. But a non fourth
    wall breaking reason is that while Yoda was slightly better than Sidious he was
    not powerful enough to kill him, which means that Sidious would have the entire
    empire on his side hunting down Yoda from that point on, which would make continuing
    the engagement at a later time very difficult if not impossible.


    So in sum if your idea of winning necessitates the death of the emperor for Yoda
    and necessitates mere survival for Sidious, then yes Sidious won. But if you take
    winning to mean doing better in the fight Yoda clearly won.

  content: 'Conclusion


    My opponent is once again trying to frame this fight in a vacuum about being the
    better fighter but as failed to answer my significant points.


    First, Yoda admits he failed his fight.\

    Second, Yoda is disarmed and loses the high ground.\

    Third, Yoda does not injure, maim or kill the emperor.\

    Fourth, he flees.


    Now if we want to say it was a draw, how can we award Yoda the victory when he
    lost the high ground? He ended the duel on the floor with no weapon and promptly
    flees. That is not a victory in any sense.\

    Even if Yoda simply flew further because he was small after the force explosion,
    he should have taken that into account if he really was the superior here.


    My opponent failed to carry the burden of proof through this debate and did not
    adequately refute the main points as to why Yoda truly lost.\

    Thank you.

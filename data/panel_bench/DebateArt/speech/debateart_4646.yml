    This is due to multiple factors, Firstly, we place importance on the ability to
    perceive conscious reality as a human, and the ability to perceive painMultiple
    scientific studies ( 1 ) Have concluded that the baby first begins to feel pain
    and become somewhat conscious at 20 weeks and on.

    Correct me if I''m wrong. You''re position is not "Abortion is ok". It''s abortion
    is ok before 20 weeks.


    "Firstly, we place importance on the ability to perceive conscious reality as
    a human, and the ability to perceive painMultiple scientific studies ( 1 ) Have
    concluded that the baby first begins to feel pain and become somewhat conscious

    Is abortion ok if the baby doesn''t feel pain or consciousness after 20 weeks
    or even long after ?


    Are you content and satisfied with your life intact?


    Would it be ok to terminate your life now?


    All of these questions aren''t rhetorical. The point is to establish some consistency
    and perhaps expose ulterior agreement.

  content: 'Firstly, My apologies for not being more specific on my stance, I should
    have explained that it is not okay after 20 weeks, however i do hope we can continue
    to have a conversation on the matter.


    If the fetus is not conscious or cannot feel pain after 20 weeks, then i would
    be fine with abortion, However, several studies have found that we can begin to
    observe these things developing around 20-24 weeks.


    It would not be okay to terminate my life, because i am currently deploying a
    conscious experience unlike a 19 week fetus is, Again, we can only see the necessary
    parts of the fetus''s brain developing after 20 weeks.

    Ok because of the shortage of rounds, I''m going to have to get to the point to
    set a rebuttal based on the information given.


    You use the term"fetus " in the context of "after 20 weeks ". Now this is in response
    to my question below.


    "Is abortion ok if the baby doesn''t feel pain or consciousness after 20 weeks
    or even long after ?"


    I specifically asked about a baby which you can continue to call a fetus. What
    is key to notice is the "after 20 weeks or even long after".


    The question you could ask me is "how much long after"?


    See with no cut off point going by a " no pain and consciousness " basis, abortion,
    termination, killing, causing an end to a life is ok with you. It''s ok, approved
    of, supported or as you say you''d be "fine" with.


    Ok let us line this up with the remaining responses that should characterize your
    position.


    "It would not be okay to terminate my life, because i am currently deploying a
    conscious experience "


    Here''s where we can verify consistency altogether.


    Wouldn''t it then be ok to terminate you once you''re not deploying conscious
    experience as you put it?


    Now normally I like to wait for the answer to make a response but once more due
    to the number of rounds, I have to get right down to the point and respond in
    advance here from a projection of anticipated answers to the question.


    If you say no, you''re inconsistent with your position and is nullified with self
    refutation.


    If you say yes, you''re consistent but expose inconsistency with the act of murder
    and abortion.


    According to what we know about the act of murder, it is not ok.

    dishonest, A baby is defined as " a very young child, especially one newly or

    Yes, Again, the part of life that we value is the ability to deploy a conscious
    experience, If i cut my head off my body, and placed my head onto a robot body,
    and a robot head on the other part of my body, then you would obviously call the
    one with the robot body me.


    In that case, we then can find that the thing we find most important in a human
    is their brain, or more importantly, as i continue to call it, " The Ability to
    deploy conscious experience"


    If someones brain dies, even if the rest of their body is working, we find it
    alright to euthanize them, This is due to the fact that they are not currently,
    and they will never again, be able to deploy the necessary portions of the brain
    necessary to grasp their existence in the first place.


    To your final question, YES if my brain wasn''t able to deploy a conscious experience,
    then it would be completely fine to kill me because the part of human life we
    value is gone.


    We say murder is BAD because it causes SUFFERING, and when one doest have the
    brain capacity to SUFFER then there is nothing wrong with killing them.


    ( If you would like, once you respond we can begin a new debate with many more
    rounds so we can have a more in depth conversation about the topic :) )

    Really it''s just semantics. It''s not a big deal. Now calling it dishonest is
    a fallacy of accusation. At some point you would agree what a woman is pregnant
    with is a baby. You''re just isolating a specific stage in the pregnancy process.
    Furthermore you didn''t even ask how I''m defining the word baby. We can be using
    the same definition, but have our preference of semantics.


    You define baby as "very young child, especially one newly or recently born."
    So according to this definition, a moment or an hour before birth in that womb
    is not a baby according to the definition. Although the physical resemblance would
    be identical, it''s not a baby prebirth, but just after.


    I wonder if it''s just half a baby when half the body is delivered during the
    process of delivery. It would of been nice for you to challenge these counter
    points. But nevertheless, the readers can get something out of it .


    The definition you''re using doesn''t really make sense of reality. What is the
    other half of that body? Remember, it''s one whole body. It''s identical just
    before and right after birth and your definition is conveying two different forms
    of beings/organisms.


    This definition much like the your position doesn''t appear to be well thought
    out.


    If there are female readers that have experience or know of others in conversation
    with women 8-9 months pregnant, do they say I''m carrying a baby or the baby is
    due next week, next month?


    Reevaluate your information.


    "To your final question, YES if my brain wasn''t able to deploy a conscious experience,
    then it would be completely fine to kill me because the part of human life we
    value is gone. "


    This wasn''t what the question was asking. See you went with a specific scenario
    where the question asked in general.


    This was the question.


    "Wouldn''t it then be ok to terminate you once you''re not deploying conscious
    experience as you put it?"


    I''m asking generally meaning I didn''t ask would it be ok to terminate you once
    you''re not deploying conscious experience DUE TO THIS OR DUE TO THAT?


    YOU ADDED the "DUE TO" part. You have to do that because you couldn''t answer
    in general. I already demonstrated once you did that , you''d be refuted.


    That question didn''t ask about "if your brain wasn''t able to". Who said you
    wouldn''t be able to again? It was kind of sly of you to add that in . You brought
    in the "no hope" and " pretty much slowing dying, withering away" scenario.


    You lose conscious experience in a coma that you can recover from. You lose conscious
    experience when you faint, sleep, receiving anesthesia, when you get knocked out
    from a fight, from nearly drowning in water. See you had to point out a specific
    scenario, particularly one where your own a death bed in order to still be arguing
    sound.


    If I''m on a death bed, what difference does it make? I''m dying, pull the plug.


    But you have to have a response to all the other possible scenarios because the
    question was in general about just losing conscious experience period. You conveniently
    avoided that because of the inconsistency that make your position fall apart and
    nullify it. All the other scenarios aren''t necessarily an event where life is
    on the way out. This is why medical professionals attempt to resuscitate.


    So because you didn''t exactly answer the question as just yes period but said
    yes "IF", your answer is really NO except for the " IF "part.


    So putting the exception aside, it would not be ok to terminate your life when
    you lose conscious experience. We already have inconsistency. Why would it not
    be ok for you but ok for other beings that would be in the same state as you?


    You''ve nullified your own position.


    "We say murder is BAD because it causes SUFFERING, and when one doest have the
    brain capacity to SUFFER then there is nothing wrong with killing them."


    This too is erroneous. Don''t ever go into society spreading this fallacious talking
    point. Murder is not based on the ability to suffer. If I kill someone unnecessarily,
    unjustly and deliberately in their sleep, experienced no suffering at all, it''s
    still murder.


    You have a very thin position on what is ok and not and you''ve contradicted yourself
    with it. I''ve demonstrated that.


    You need more of an intricate basis rather than such a simplistic standard. It''s
    too broad and it was how I was able to expose your contradiction between abortion
    and murder.


    I understand Fred Hampton was murdered in his sleep. He experienced no consciousness
    from being drugged. Although the powers that be at the time ruled the in incident
    the other way. No different with the powers that be at the time of slavery ruling
    that just .


    Point is don''t think I can just kill someone unjustly that will not suffer from
    it all of the sudden make it just. I will be facing criminal prosecution.


    To wrap all this up with a nice ribbon on it, the opposing side negated their
    position, rejected their own position, has falsified abortion being ok not only
    just after 20 weeks but prior by their own standard it wouldn''t be ok to terminate
    their life due to no conscious experience, the same rule negates "no conscious
    experience" argument before 20 weeks in life development.

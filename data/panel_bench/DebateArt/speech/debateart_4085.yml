    For those who are not aware, synthetic diamonds are a fast-growing market alternative
    to natural diamonds in both fashion and industrial applications such as abrasives
    and drills. These two fields value different qualities in a finished product,
    so I will go over them separately. First though, I will note that synthetic diamonds
    are cheaper to produce than diamond mining operations, and are much more able
    to meet commercial demand.


    **Industrial**


    In industrial applications, the two most important qualities of a diamond are
    its hardness and thermal conductivity. Not all natural diamonds are suitable,
    while synthetic diamonds can be made with a much lower margin of error. For this
    reason, cost, and the high amount of demand for industrial-use diamonds, 90% of
    diamonds used in industrial applications are synthetic.[\[1\]](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/national-minerals-information-center/industrial-diamond-statistics-and-information)


    **Fashion**


    Diamonds have long been used in jewelry, and are valued by "the four Cs," carat,
    clarity, color, and cut. A raw, unprocessed diamond from the ground can occur
    in a variety of shapes. These are not typically used in jewelry, instead they
    must first be cut and polished to a desired shape to catch light in an aesthetic
    way. Once again, impurities in natural diamonds can render them unsuitable for
    use as gemstones, with only 20% making the cut.\[[2](https://www.minerals.net/mineral/diamond.aspx)\]


    Carat\

    Not to be confused with "karat" which is used to indicate the purity of gold,
    a carat refers to the mass of a gemstone, equaling 0.2 grams. In terms of sheer
    size, natural diamonds beat out synthetic diamonds, at least with current technology.
    The largest synthetic diamond I could find a record of weighed 150.42 carats,
    whereas the Cullinan Diamond, also known as the Star of Africa, weighed 3,106.75
    carats (less than 1.5 lbs)[\[3\]](https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/621492-largest-synthetic-uncut-diamond)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cullinan_Diamond).
    The most common gem-cut diamonds, those seen in wedding and engagement rings,
    only tend to be 1-1.2 carats.


    Cut\

    Cut is the least variable between the two types of diamond. A gem quality natural
    diamond can be cut in all the same ways as a synthetic diamond can.


    Clarity\

    Clarity is determined by irregularities/impurities in the diamond structure. High
    irregularities cause cloudiness, which is highly undesirable. This is the most
    likely reason for a stone to be considered unsuitable as a gem.


    Color\

    Color is caused by impurities in the elemental makeup of the diamond, or else
    by alterations of the lattice into a slightly different structure. While a pure
    carbon diamond will be clear, additions of certain elements can change its hue,
    for instance boron will give it a blue color. These can also be done in synthetic
    diamonds, including the incredibly rare red diamonds, though obviously a synthetic
    one is not valued nearly so highly.


    Current synthetic diamonds can consistently match natural diamonds in all but
    carat, though very few people are going to be looking for such large diamonds,
    much less be able to afford them. Large diamonds suitable for gemcutting are incredibly
    rare.


    Cost


    Synthetic diamonds are significantly cheaper to produce, with more recent figures
    putting them at 50-70% cheaper than a similar natural diamond.[\[5\]](https://shop.kenanddanadesign.com/pages/lab-diamonds-mined-diamonds-cost-prices)


    **Availability**


    The supply of natural diamonds is inherently limited by how much can be mined
    from the earth or resold from existing gems. By comparison, synthetic diamonds
    can be grown in a matter of weeks and the industry can be scaled to match demand.


    **History**


    The history of diamond mining isn''t a pretty one, with people like Cecil Rhodes
    exploiting and abusing black workers in his mines in South Africa. Even today,
    65% of diamonds are mined in Africa. I personally prefer the idea of not owning
    a diamond that may have been the product of forced labor and racism.


    **Conclusion**


    Synthetic diamonds are, on balance, superior to natural diamonds for fulfilling
    the purposes of diamonds, namely as a fashion accessory and in industrial application.

    Since none of Pro''s definitions match the word in the way that it was used, I
    suggest we use the _**correct**_ one.\

    Organic- Characterized by continuous or natural development.


    Now we''re getting somewhere. Despite synthetic diamonds being made of the same
    particles, they were not developed the same way as a natural diamond and therefore
    do not fit the definition.

    argue that the Model T Ford is the best mass-produced automobile, with all successors

    As stated before, natural diamonds are better at being natural. The fact that
    the creation of synthetic diamonds has improved with time only proves my point
    of them being less original than natural diamonds.


    > Ah yes, the emotional appeal of systemic racism and forced labor, how compelling.


    Those are the faults of mankind and the mining industry, not the shortcomings
    of natural diamonds.\

    Natural diamonds are not sentient beings. So, they lack the capacity to be racist
    or to force people into labor.


    > Did you do **ANY** research for this topic? The natural diamond industry is

    (the same people to come up with the slogan "Diamonds are forever") has been the

    Once a natural diamond had been mined and is used as a store product, it loses
    its purity and ceases to be a natural diamond.\

    Therefore, synthetic diamonds are the true abomination.

    So, Pro implies there ARE differences in the way that they look, but they''re
    just subtle.\

    I don''t know what Pro is talking about. If you google pictures of both, natural
    diamonds look better.


    **Conclusion:**\

    So I have maintained all of my arguments proving the superiority of natural diamonds
    at being natural and demonstrated that synthetic diamonds are a product of corruption
    and pure evil.\

    _Extend all arguments._\

    Vote **CON.**

    Once again, every synthetic diamond is unique, just as natural diamonds are. This
    point is flatly untrue.

    You never said the word, but my argument was that you were conflating the two

    Pro does not cite a source for this definition, and both of my definitions are
    _correct_, whether or not they are applicable in the debate''s context.


    > > Ah yes, the emotional appeal of systemic racism and forced labor, how compelling.

    I was not the one who claimed that natural diamonds possessed "imagined divinity
    and power." If the historical context of rarity and association with nobility
    and purity can be applied, then so can the darker side of its past.


    > Once a natural diamond had been mined and is used as a store product, it loses
    its purity and ceases to be a natural diamond.\

    > Therefore, synthetic diamonds are the true abomination.


    This is not the definition of a natural diamond, and I challenge you to provide
    a source saying otherwise. A natural diamond may be cut and still be natural,
    this only refers to the process by which the stone is formed, not anything that
    happens afterward.


    > Therefore, synthetic diamonds are the true abomination.


    This is a total non sequitur. Somehow your perception of diamonds losing their
    "purity" and natural status makes synthetics even worse?


    > So, Pro implies there ARE differences in the way that they look, but they''re
    just subtle.\

    > I don''t know what Pro is talking about. If you google pictures of both, natural

    They are literally not visible to the naked eye! Unless you''re getting a degree
    in gemology sometime soon, it will literally never matter. As for your googled
    pictures, being different, I''m assuming that you''re looking at uncut stones,
    which do tend to form differently. My point on the cut gems being essentially
    identical stands.


    **Conclusion**: Con has argued the truism of natural diamonds being natural diamonds,
    while I have argued in favor of synthetic diamonds being superiors for all industrial
    applications, fashion, and cost.

  content: '**Miss Housekeeping**


    My opponent does not respond to this at all. I''ll ask him to do so in the next
    round. He also did not respond to my point on the **Korean-American employee,
    Elizabeth Warren, banning Muslims and** **implying that white supremacists were
    morally equivalent to the people resisting racism.**


    **Calling Mexicans Names**


    Saying that "some" are good people implies that he believes that **most** **are
    bad people**. However, jumping to that conclusion solely based on race is **racist**.


    Did you know that 80% of drug smugglers are Americans? \[[1](https://mic.com/articles/32577/80-of-drug-smugglers-are-american-citizens-not-illegal-immigrants)\]
    So there''s one lie. Whites account for 71% of all rapes in America (even though
    they''re only 63% of America), while Latinos are only 9%, even though they''re
    17% of the population. \[[2](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/07/donald-trump-mexicans-119849)\]
    That''s two lies. I could not find statistics on human trafficking, but I will
    point out that my opponent has given none to prove his point either.


    So, with all of that said, all of these unfounded claims Trump is making are based
    solely on the fact that these people are Mexicans, which is **racist**.


    **Retweeted White Nationalists**


    My opponent uses the definition of "nationalist," but he should be using the definition
    of "white nationalist," which is "one of a group of militant whites who espouse
    white supremacy and advocate enforced racial segregation." \[[3](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/white%20nationalist)\]
    So, while being a nationalist isn''t racist, being a white nationalist is.


    **Black Voters**


    Generalizing an entire demographic and assuming their social and/or economic status
    based purely off of their skin color is **racist**. Also, Trump only gave statistics
    for the black youth unemployment, not his other claims, which itself is wrong
    (it may have been correct at the time, but I''m not sure). \[[4](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/10/05/jobs-report-black-teen-unemployment-lowest-record/1536572002/)\]


    **Fine People On Both Sides**


    My opponent says that Trump calling saying both sides have "very fine people"
    is just acknowledging their right to protest. For comparison, if a murderer is
    arrested, do the police have to call him/her a "very fine person" in order to
    read said murderer his/her Miranda rights? No, that''s absurd. Likewise, calling
    someone "very fine" has no correlation with their rights. I can call a murderer
    a monster and still give him/her his/her Miranda rights.


    **Racially Discriminating Against Black People In Apartments**


    Trump''s word is trumped (pun intended) by the actual facts that were organized.
    They show racism in his apartment renting practices.


    **Lowering Black Unemployment**


    The claim that Trump had any effect on this is wrong. The percentage has been
    falling at the same rate for years, and since it never went up when Trump was
    elected, that means he had no effect on it. \[[5](https://www.epi.org/blog/before-the-state-of-the-union-a-fact-check-on-black-unemployment/)\]


    **Less Racism**


    This is a post-hoc fallacy. You can''t say that Trump caused less racism just
    because he was elected when it decreased. Does this report say why people experienced
    less racism? Also, 2,500 is not that many.


    Finally, even if Trump DID cause this, that has no reflection on him being racist
    or not.

    This is true. However, you are forgetting that there were also counter protesters.
    Also not all those on the side for not taking the statue down were white supremacists.
    So Trump was talking about both sides there being good people. Those in favor
    of tearing the statue down and those against.


    Trump calling Warren Pocahontas was deriding her. An actual descendant of Pocahontas
    actually supported Trump in calling Warren Pocahontas and the Cherokees were furious
    at her not Trump.\

    Yes, he tried to ban people from Muslim countries that sponsor terrorism. How
    is that racist? Sounds to me like he is protecting the country. Also he has never
    tried to deport legal Muslim immigrants. You would think he would since he is
    "racist" against them. Actually last time I checked Muslim isn''t a race, but
    a religion.

    Maybe, unlike you apparently. he doesn''t consult his staff when he posts things
    on Twitter and perhaps others don''t want to tell him what he should and should''nt
    post on Twitter.


    Trump didn''t discriminate against blacks. He didn''t even mention blacks. He
    said he didn''t want welfare people in his apartments whether they were white
    or black.

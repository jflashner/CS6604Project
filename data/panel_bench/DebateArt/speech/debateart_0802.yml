    For a comedic touch, I will now present you with my impression of Ben Shapiro


    (weasely voice) "The left wing is fundamentally immoral, because left wing politics
    is based on theft and distorting the facts of biology and objective morality.
    That''s why it''s impossible to debate a left winger, they can''t debate you because
    there is no objective reality in their self-entitlednihilisticpostmodernistculturalmarxistmoralrelativistworldview.
    That''s why they argue with pure feelings based rhetoric, because studies show
    that liberals are ugly, have low testosterone and are more likely to be indifferent
    to facts than right wingers. Also all left wingers are anti-semites and everyone
    who was ever a bad person was a leftist and an atheist. Also there is no such
    thing as a rich person who is bad unless they are a left winger."

    He is not fat, pretty fit actually. Next point.

    Any proof for this?

    This is an opinion. Any real examples?


    Ben Shapiro is an intellectual because he backs everything up he says with facts
    or some sort of logical reasoning. He has statistics right in the back of his
    mind and takes questions from liberals and then answers it with the things I just
    described.


    > Also all left wingers are anti-semites and everyone who was ever a bad person
    was a leftist and an atheist. Also there is no such thing as a rich person who
    is bad unless they are a left winger."


    He has never said this. He is willing to engage with the left and have civil dialogue.
    Ben rationalizes people''s positions and educates college students. He never uses
    these feelings based rhetoric, it actually sounds like what a liberal would say
    to a conservative because most liberals just shout and don''t have a discussion
    with conservatives.


    Conclusion--


    My opponent has only given opinions and feelings based arguments, and has not
    backed it up with any examples or evidence. I await for him to do so.

    I didn''t mean physically fat, what I am really calling him is a right wing shill,
    a point which you chose to ignore. Ben Shapiro is a big fat dirty filthy repugnant
    repulsive sack of goblin shite because he is nothing but a propaganda shill.


    > Any proof for this?


    In this 3 minute video alone Ben Shapiro conflates the position of every left
    winger on earth with extreme pro-abortion attitudes and asserts that the woman
    he is debating agrees with these attitudes while she repeatedly denies it, and
    as she tries to explain her position he constantly makes false equivalencies and
    conflationary assertions about her positions, even comparing abortion to the slave-trade
    in an incredibly intellectually dishonest display of his anti-intellectual sleazeball
    antics.\

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCzH09ja_aE>


    There are many, many more examples of him being an intellectually dishonest right
    wing shill. He does these things in every debate he has.


    > Ben Shapiro is an intellectual because he backs everything up he says with facts

    > He has statistics right in the back of his mind


    What good are statistics when they are cherry picked and used to misrepresent
    people''s arguments and positions?


    Since you believe that child-rape is a harmless hobby, let me show you some statistics
    showing that you are harming children.


    > Ben rationalizes people''s positions and educates college students


    He does the exact opposite of those things. He tries to cancel out any nuanced
    discussion with his radical assertions and oversimplications and he constantly
    lies to college students in an attempt to convince them that all left wingers
    are deranged anti-free speech communists who just shout and don''t want to have
    an honest discussion with conservatives.


    > He has never said this.


    He is an ethno-nationalist (zionist) Jew who cries like a little SJW pansy whenever
    someone criticizes Israel and calls them an anti-semite.


    Here is Shapiro whining about leftists who don''t support Israel and conflating
    all leftists with having extreme anti-zionist views. He is also fallaciously insinuating
    that they are pro-hamas, conflating all leftism with socialism and conflating
    socialism with "equality of outcome" all in the same 2 minute video.\

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4cq2S4zODI>


    If you ask Shapiro, literally every authoritarian regime in history was left-wing
    and run by atheists.\

    First, you should be able to give specific instances and quotes of when Ben was
    being anti-intellectual, not a 3 minute video I have to piece apart and guess
    what you are saying. Ben said "most" not every single person on earth. The women
    said "I am certainly a person that believes the mother''s rights usurp the baby''s
    rights." She was very inconsistent in her positioning. Ben then said "In what
    world would my rights be allowed to kill another human being?" To which the guest
    very anti-intellectually said "Well you''re not a woman." This was a lame argument
    and an example of Ben being rational and the women not. He was speaking to slave-holders
    because he was making a point that slave-owners can hold human beings and kill
    them if they want, which is what is happening in abortion.


    > XD


    If you consider this an argument then you are not debating. This could affect
    the Argument and Conduct point as well.

    He logically pieces together information from their questions an has a discussion
    with them. The second part is true, a lot of anti-free speech communists do not
    want to have an honest discussion.

    He only referrers to some. Nowhere in their did he say "all."


    > If you ask Shapiro, literally every authoritarian regime in history was left-wing

    He cites a video but literally all he mentions is Hitler and Stalin as examples.
    He never said "all" or anything to that extent. All he said was Hitler was closer
    to the left in his regime.


    > You must be a widdle baby SJW feewings-based Jew hater like omg.


    Poor conduct.


    Ben Shapiro is intellectual because he skipped two grades, grades 3 and 9, and
    has many great points and logic.\

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbNYOyPRpgg>\

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPxaZE2Ehpc>


    If you watch any of his lectures, he backs everything up with facts and logic
    and never hesitates to answer questions or back up his political positions.

    I am allowed to have a little fun. What are you, some kind of SJW who can''t take
    a joke?


    > First, you should be able to give specific instances and quotes of when

    You have literally been repeating that he is so brilliant and logical throughout
    the debate without providing a single smidgen of evidence. A three minute video
    is about as concise as it gets. What do you expect, exact 10 second snippets of
    all of his quotes addressed one by one?


    > Ben said "most" not every single person on earth.


    Ben did not say either, instead he leaves it open to interpretation and vaguely
    refers to everything he criticises as "the left". He always insinuates "all" in
    the way that he says "the left believes this" and refers to it as an agenda shared
    by all leftists but he never says it directly, since he wants to appear fair and
    balanced. He wants to create an "us vs them" and try to atomize "the left" as
    a single ideology. If you believe that the democratic party is run by cultural
    marxists and that Bernie Sanders is a commie then you are living proof of Shapiro''s
    heinous propaganda tactics.


    > The women said "I am certainly a person that believes the mother''s rights usurp
    the baby''s rights."


    She did not say that.

    > as examples. He never said "all" or anything to that extent. All he

    > said was Hitler was closer to the left in his regime.


    For the record, he believes Hitler was a socialist, which would make him extremely
    far left. This is a one sided and dishonest way of portraying it because Fascism
    is usually difficult to pinpoint on the political spectrum and has both extreme
    leftist and extreme right wing elements. For example, Nazi Germany was extremely
    collectivist but also extremely nationalistic and conservative in regards to German
    cultural values. Ben Shapiro wants to convince you that fascism, communism, social
    democracy and socialism are all the same thing, which is simply not true.

    I gave 3 pieces of evidence out of many in the last round alone, and you did not
    rebut to any of them.

    This is an opinion of what you thought he meant by saying it, not a fact with
    a basis. It''s also important to not he refers to leftists as extreme liberals
    and leftists are different than moderate democrats or classical liberals.


    > She did not say that.


    She absolutely said that. You should know what is in the source you yourself cited.
    2:34-2:55 is when she says "I am certainly a person that believes the mother''s
    rights usurp the baby''s rights."


    > For the record, he believes Hitler was a socialist, which would make him extremely
    far left. This is a one sided and dishonest way of portraying it because Fascism

    Hitler was a socialist. An example is Germany banned guns in the 20''s. He gave
    his people little freedom and the government of Germany controlled people like
    a socialistic society, which lead to the Holocaust. Fascism is "is a form of radical
    authoritarian ultra-nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible
    suppression of opposition, and strong regimentation of society and of the economy."
    This means government has full control over their people,, which is a trait of
    Socialists and the let-wing, more government.


    My opponent did not respond to these 3 points last round, which is poor conduct.


    "Ben Shapiro is intellectual because he skipped two grades, grades 3 and 9, and
    has many great points and logic.\

    In response to his abortion interview evidence, I said "Ben said "most" not every
    single person on earth. The women said "I am certainly a person that believes
    the mother''s rights usurp the baby''s rights." She was very inconsistent in her
    positioning. Ben then said "In what world would my rights be allowed to kill another
    human being?" To which the guest very anti-intellectually said "Well you''re not
    a woman." This was a lame argument and an example of Ben being rational and the
    women not. He was speaking to slave-holders because he was making a point that
    slave-owners can hold human beings and kill them if they want, which is what is
    happening in abortion."


    He did not respond to this either which is poor conduct. He also used "XD" as
    his only argument against one of my points.


    He also said "You must be a widdle baby SJW feewings-based Jew hater like omg."
    which is also poor conduct, along with "a big fat dirty filthy repugnant repulsive
    sack of goblin shit because he is nothing but a propaganda shill."


    Conclusion--


    I have proven that with my many points and evidence I should get the voters''
    votes, along with the poor conduct by pro and his refusal to respond to multiple
    of my arguments and rebuts. Vote Con!

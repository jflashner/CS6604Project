  content: 'Slavery is a system of forced labor in which individuals are treated as
    property and are forced to work against their will. Slavery has existed throughout
    history in many different cultures and regions, and it continues to exist in some
    parts of the world today.


    Slavery is believed to have originated in ancient civilizations, where it was
    often a normal part of society. In ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, for example,
    slaves were used for a variety of purposes, including agricultural labor, domestic
    work, and military service. In ancient Greece and Rome, slaves were also an important
    part of society, and they were used for a wide range of tasks, including agricultural
    labor, mining, and manufacturing. ([SLAVERY IN ANCIENT EGYPT](https://factsanddetails.com/world/cat56/sub404/entry-6151.html))\

    During the Middle Ages, slavery continued to exist in Europe, and it also spread
    to the Americas with the arrival of European colonizers. In the Americas, slaves
    were used primarily for agricultural labor, and they were an essential part of
    the economy in many parts of the Americas.\

    In the 19th and early 20th centuries, slavery was abolished in many parts of the
    world, including in the United States with the passage of the 13th Amendment to
    the Constitution in 1865. However, slavery continues to exist in some parts of
    the world today, and it is a major human rights issue. The international community
    has worked to combat slavery and to protect the rights of workers around the world,
    but the problem persists in many parts of the world. ([Who We Are - ATEST](https://endslaveryandtrafficking.org/who-we-are/))


    > In 1871 the Virginia Supreme Court ruled that prisoners were a "slave of the
    state"


    Prisoners are not considered slaves of the state, at least not anymore. Slavery
    is a **system** of involuntary servitude (it is important to know the difference
    between slavery and involuntary servitude), in which one person is owned and controlled
    by another person. In the United States, slavery was abolished with the passage
    of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1865. While prisoners may not be
    considered slaves, they are subject to the authority of the state and are required
    to follow the rules and regulations of the prison system. They do not have the
    same freedoms as non-incarcerated individuals and are not able to live and work
    as they please.


    > Another term used for involuntary servitude is also known as human trafficking


    Yes, human trafficking is a form of modern-day slavery. In fact, the United Nations
    Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) defines human trafficking as "the acquisition
    of people by improper means such as force, fraud or deception, with the aim of
    exploiting them." ([Human-Trafficking](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/human-Trafficking/Human-Trafficking.html))
    This definition encompasses many of the same elements as traditional slavery,
    such as the use of force or coercion, the exploitation of victims for labor or
    services, and the lack of freedom and autonomy for those who are trafficked. Like
    slavery, human trafficking is illegal in most countries and is considered a serious
    crime.\

    You have yet to explain the link between human trafficking and slavery.


    > As you can see, this law clearly forbids forced Labor without an exception.


    Your second point''s basis is flawed. You are mistaking human trafficking and
    slavery to be the same; human trafficking and slavery are similar in that they
    both involve the exploitation of individuals for labor or services, and they both
    involve the use of force, coercion, or deception to control victims. However,
    there are some key differences between the two.


    One key difference is that slavery is typically associated with the ownership
    of individuals, whereas human trafficking does not necessarily involve the ownership
    of victims. In slavery, individuals are considered the property of their owners
    and can be bought and sold as such. In human trafficking, victims are often recruited,
    transported, and exploited for labor or services, but they are not necessarily
    considered the property of their traffickers.


    Another difference is that slavery is a long-standing practice with a long history,
    whereas human trafficking is a more recent phenomenon that has become more prevalent
    in recent decades. Slavery has existed in many different forms throughout history,
    and it continues to exist in some parts of the world today. Human trafficking,
    on the other hand, is a crime that has grown in scope and complexity in recent
    years, as global economic and social conditions have changed.\

    Despite these differences, both slavery and human trafficking are illegal and
    are considered serious crimes. Both practices violate the fundamental human rights
    of victims and are condemned by the international community.


    > The 13th Amendment allows an exception for something that is already considered
    a crime


    This exception was included in the amendment because at the time it was ratified,
    many people who were convicted of crimes were required to perform labor as part
    of their punishment. This included both enslaved individuals who had been convicted
    of crimes, as well as free individuals who were sentenced to perform labor as
    part of their punishment.


    By including this exception, the 13th Amendment sought to prohibit slavery and
    involuntary servitude, while also recognizing the longstanding practice of requiring
    individuals who had been convicted of crimes to perform labor as part of their
    punishment. This allowed for the continuation of this practice, while also ensuring
    that it was limited to individuals who had been convicted of crimes and were serving
    a sentence in prison.\

    Overall, the 13th Amendment''s exception for punishment for a crime was included
    in the amendment in order to recognize the existing practice of requiring individuals
    who had been convicted of crimes to perform labor as part of their punishment,
    while also prohibiting slavery and involuntary servitude in other contexts.


    Amendment 13th''s exception is a necessary part of the criminal justice system
    and that it provides prisoners with valuable work experience and skills that can
    help them to re-enter society after their release. They argue that requiring prisoners
    to perform labor helps to maintain order and discipline within the prison system,
    and that it can provide a sense of responsibility and purpose for inmates.


    Additionally, many prisons operate industries and businesses that provide goods
    and services to the state or to the private sector. These industries can generate
    revenue for the prison system, which can be used to fund rehabilitation programs,
    education, and other services for prisoners. By requiring prisoners to work, supporters
    argue that these industries can be maintained and can provide valuable vocational
    training and job skills for inmates.


    Overall, it is a necessary and beneficial part of the criminal justice system,
    and that it helps to promote public safety, order, and rehabilitation within the
    prison system.


    > I am still to establish why the US government would continue using forced servitude
    and how they still owe reparations for the current prisoners still in prisons
    today,


    Such reason has been given above.


    **In conclusion**:


    The Instigator has no grounds to form his theory. Flawed and misleading evidence,
    the lack of supporting evidence, logical fallacies, and contradictions with his
    established facts.


    Instigator''s main ideas:


    - Prisoners are "slaves of the state" - _Refuted argument_

    - Forced Labor is slavery. - _Refuted argument_

    \nI concede to this argument, for the reasons that have been already argued till\

    \ that realizing that something more profitable for some and over the years have\
    \ been historically speaking, horrific treatment of people. I.E. Attica in New\
    \ York, Angola of Louisiana, etc...\\\n_A report published by the American Civil\
    \ Liberties Union in June 2022 found about 800,000 prisoners out of the 1.2 million\
    \ in state and federal prisons are forced to work, generating a conservative estimate\
    \ of $11bn annually in goods and services while average wages range from 13 cents\
    \ to 52 cents per hour._\n\nThat revenue mentioned above doesn't even account\

    \ should have with the prison system are far too great for mention here. However,\
    \ anyone interested in making their head explode visit\\\n<https://www.prisonpolicy.org/>\n\
    \nI digress. The real reason to instigate this debateIs that in this country you\
    \ are 5 times more likely to be imprisoned if you are black then if you were white.\
    \ 40% of the U.S prison system are black. While blacks only represent 12. 2% of\
    \ the total population of the U.S.\n\nThose numbers are not just.\\\nNor can they\
    \ be excused, ignored, or dismissed.\n\nZoning laws leading up to about one or\
    \ two generations ago openly discriminated against all non whites. Even after\
    \ the law changed the verbage changed from \"Negro\" and \"white\" to \"poor\"\
    \ and \"not poor\". Anyone who lives anywhere in this country can see the segregation\
    \ even to this day. Intentionally cutting budgets to those neighborhoods. Intentionally\
    \ driving the value of real estate in to the ground so that no business that hire\
    \ will build. Limiting employment, education funding, limiting infrastructure,\
    \ funding for parks and beautification almost to non existence. Perpetuating more\
    \ and more violent crime, homelessness , hunger, drug addiction and mental illness\
    \ in those areas. That's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to targeting\
    \ minorities for cheap labor.\\\nI couldn't possibly itemize all the injustices.\\\
    \nHowever, let me leave the readers with two parting thoughts.\n\n1. A woman with\
    \ the name Jane Elliot in 1968 following the Assassination of Martin Luther King\
    \ Jr. conducted an experiment some might remember from phy 101 called \"the blue\
    \ eyes, brown eyes experiment.\" If you are not familiar I would encourage a quick\
    \ search on YouTube. However, she lead a demonstration that I found particularly\
    \ profound. This demonstration wasn't about feeling like the roles were reversed.\
    \ This was about choosing to switch.\\\n   She stood in front of a group of white\
    \ college students in an auditorium and asked \"If you, as a white person, would\
    \ be happy to receive the same treatment as black citizens do in this society...\
    \ Stand.\"\\\n   Spoiler Alert! No one stood.\\\n   Which means, that they are\
    \ completely aware that there is a problem, and they know they wouldn't want it\
    \ for themselves, yet are willing to except it for others.\n\n2. The quote was\
    \ part of a 1994 interview with John Ehrlichman, who served 18 months in prison\
    \ for his central role in the Watergate scandal. He was a top white Aide. Regarding\
    \ Nixon's war on drugs.\n\n_\u201CYou want to know what this was really all about?\u201D\
    \ he asked with the bluntness of a man who, after public disgrace and a stretch\
    \ in federal prison, had little left to protect. \u201CThe Nixon campaign in 1968,\
    \ and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and\
    \ black people. You understand what I\u2019m saying? We knew we couldn\u2019t\
    \ make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public\
    \ to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing\
    \ both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders,\
    \ raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night\
    \ on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we\
    \ did.\u201D_\\\nIn closing, The history of slavery leaves little to establish\
    \ a connection from Ancient Egypt, and stigma that was created by the African\
    \ Slave trade to the Americas. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until Systema naturae\
    \ in **1735**, in which the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus proposed a classification\
    \ of humankind into four distinct races. European, American, African, Asian. In\
    \ 1890, the first census you could choose if you were white or black. Changing\
    \ the way the world looks at the color of skin certainly deserves it's unique\
    \ designation in history.\\\nDefining what indentured slavery, slavery, involuntary\
    \ servitude, or a pimp stable, is missing the point of the Americas other unique\
    \ designation. The highest number of incarcerated prisoners per capita than any\
    \ other country in the world.. by far. The minority of 12% making up almost half\
    \ of that prison population is the point that regardless of what name we associate\
    \ with injustice, the people experiencing it first hand never deserved it. Therefore,\
    \ reparations for false imprisonment, defamation of character, lynchings, unjust\
    \ killings, led in the water, etc.... are still owed to them. What are they guilty\
    \ of, for the most part (exceptions included) was to commit crimes of survival.\
    \ When the conditions preset for them were designed for them to fail. Yet they\
    \ persisted, and assimilated. I don't believe anything I have said regarding the\

    great chemistry together. Their music is best enjoyed while under the influence
    of multiple drugs. Their unorthodox style make them more fun to listen to than
    many rappers who are arguably better at "rippity rapping" or whatever you want
    to call it.

    work and sife-group work from each member because the description only says I
    had to include members.


    That said, I am going to correct the restriction and stick to two rappers who
    are not recognised as a duo but have so much crossover in their venn diagram of
    rap tracks and circles:


    Vinnie Paz and Apathy


    They are pioneers of the grimiest, nastiest rap you keep your grandparents and
    grandchildren away from equally.


    Nasty rap, horrorcore shit, himophobic slurs in their earlier work straight up
    detailed death threats, toxic masculinity to high heaven down to the depths of
    hell.


    They are everything wrong with rap embodied, embracing it, spitting with the slickest
    flow and most wince-inducing punchlines you feel the sting of hours after hearing.


    They are a duo, Eminem, K-Rino, Black Thought, Tech N9ne and many other gods of
    rap as well as goddesses like Sa-Roc will intentionally avoid beefing with. They
    may be 2 caucasians but they have real gangster ties, come from a ghetto each,
    Vinnie from downtown Philly since a child (actually born in Sicily itself) and
    Apathy from Conneticut.


    Their styles crossed state lines, they early on realised that both were alphas
    in their respective domains and wanted to avoid beef. So, Apathy with his guys
    in Apathy Dmeigodz and Vinnie with his AOTP boys (one of the most loyal ended
    up being Apathy himself) teamed up, had group meets.


    The entire underground scene in Philly and Cutty began to cheer for and embrace
    the other group, due to these 2 and their chemistry. Nobody calls them a duo but
    they were the gel, the masterminds holding together what could have otherwise
    been a eormanently battling pair of factions in rap, torn down the middle.


    They bonded over conspiracy theories and being Libertarians who hate the government
    (Vinnie originally a more socialist type but now ambiguous, Apathy a dedicated
    anarchist from the start who probably leans right).\

    Easily out of anybody''s top 20 underground rap tracks, these guys would be in
    12 of them, unless you are easily offended.


    They also were brilliant at using producers (Paz more so) that delved into ignoring
    hip hop norms and breaking genre boundaries.


    Some of their earliest work will not sound like Vinnie Paz at all as he had not
    broken his voice or got the grit to his voice yet. I assure you, it is him and
    you can hear that even early on they had this insane chemistry you couldn''t fuck
    with.


    I assume I can show tracks with both that include others on top.


    Fucking love this shit god yes.

    (In case you are confused at a reference Apathy makes in the above track, Paz
    invited Apathy to do tracks with him on Jodeind Tricks but that was just a duo
    mainly with Paz and Jus Allah and a producer named Stoupe). AOTP is where their
    real fire chemistry camd through, imo.


    Now, listen to them later on, when they have properly formed a chemistry in rap
    and gone fully into the horrorcore wild shit:


    **Sumerians (lyrically, not melodically, one of the best AOTP tracks of all time).**

    This is entertaining to some but highly offensive to others. While Eazy Mac and
    Golden BSP aren''t exactly clean their music is more innocent and accessible.
    Vinnie Paz and Apathy are described here as being scumbags whereas Mac and Goldie
    are just an entertaining and hedonistic duo for the most part. Whats more though,
    Eazy and Golden have lyrics and songs that appeal to more hardcore rap fans, its
    just that they focus more on being entertaining and unique than being hyper-lyrical
    and hardcore.


    I admit that Honkey Kong was a very good choice. It exemplifies the rhyme and
    flow and entertainingness Apathy is capable of while avoiding the over the top
    griminess in most of their music. I bet you can''t use a single other track that
    comes close to it in that regard.


    Con is using older work to avoid the blender-like qualities of Vinnie Paz that
    Con refers to as "grit". Apathy''s delivery/voice is sort of plain compared to
    Golden and Eazy who both stand out more in terms of delivery.\

    This last song is about benzo addiction. I doubt Con''s hyper toxic masculinity
    homophobic murder rappers are in touch with their feelings enough to have made
    a song on this side of the rap spectrum. The music and video are symbolic. The
    blurry/warped imagery of the scenery in the background represents the effects
    of benzos and the way the verse repeats represents the memory loss associated
    with heavy benzo use which reinforces the deja vu that comes with returning to
    the same negative habits. The broken heart concept represents feeling let down
    by the drug as even though they are "in love" with it, it has done more harm than
    good.\

    this:


    > I doubt Con''s hyper toxic masculinity homophobic murder rappers are in touch
    with their feelings enough to have made a song on this side of the rap spectrum.


    Paz has this side to his work but that side is largely away from the stuff he''s
    done with Apathy. Furthermore, this line from Pro highlights a fundamental issue
    with Pro''s entire case:


    **Nothing defines greatness so far in the debate. Nothing defines better.**


    Pro even sticks to ''rap'' because Pro is fully aware that if we go into Hip-Hop
    itself, Golden BSP is a shithow joke of a sing-song mumble rapper and Eazy Mac
    (EM) is perhaps good but only slightly above average.


    Paz and Apathy are gods both as rappers and influencers of a lot of HipHop. They
    never had the fame of Eminem or Jay-Z, true. They are not some new era Pac and
    Biggie but they are a duo that has pioneered a lot of underground rap and are
    much truer to the roots of Hiphop and rapping, than Eazy Mac and BSP.


    I don''t need to show you Apathy''s ode to his dead father or Pac''s emotional
    rapping or conscious rapping to prove they are better. As a duo, they specialised
    in horrorcore, battle-rap vibe stuff. Pure unfiltered aggressive rapping with
    slick flow and top tier lyricism. They led groups, united inside AOTP and separately
    with Paz leading JMT, AOTP and Heavy Metal Kings (a duo with Ill Bill) and Apathy
    primarily leading his group ''Demigodz'' where he and Celph Titled are the 2 core
    members.


    If you ''fact check me'' Apathy didn''t invent Demigodz but they dies out in 1997
    and in 2000 he reformed them as the new leader with Apathy being the reason the
    Demigodz didn''t die as he was an opener for Rakim and such at shows and Celph
    was pretty loyal too.


    [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demigodz**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demigodz)


    While Pro says you need to be on drugs to enjoy EM and BSP duo at their best,
    I say you can be not only sober but pissed off and unhappy and AOTP music will
    hit you in the feels. Yes, it''s toxic, yes it''s filled with hate and anger but
    much like ''metal'' this form of rap they specialise in is euphoric for the unhappy.


    It''s not like you listen to AOTP and think ''oh let me be a gangster'' ever.
    They don''t sugarcoat the ''horror'' of that life, it''s part of why I appreciate
    what they do. They come out pure, unfiltered and show you the inhuman demonic
    aspects of being gangster, it''s a different angle from a lot of battle rap. There
    is no way if you are a genuinely sane and tame citizen that you listen to AOTP
    music and want to become a ruthless gangster. Instead, you go ''wow they are nasty
    and that''s a horrible life but fuck they rap sooooo good''. They actually have
    probably deterred many from going down the gangster route because they are so
    real about how a gangster thinks and feels.


    It''s battle rap, horrorcore rap... Hiphop itself at is purest, grimiest and lyrically
    peak performing level.


    IDK what Pro meant about me going for Paz''s earlier work. Paz has been around
    for a long, long time now as has Apathy. Their earlier work is 2000s stuff, even
    90s. I actually think Paz in particular spat more annoying when he was higher
    pitched and less slick with the flow, I actually gave you later Paz in Round 1.


    I want you to just sit back, relax and appreciate how incredible the rhyme schemes,
    wordplay and anunciation is from these rappers. Then listen to BSP whining in
    sing-song heee haww ding dong delivery and EM coming like hurrrdeeee hawww IDGAF
    yeah man chil chill puff puff passs lyrical skillz bruh.


    Time to show you real rap at its peak:


    **FEEL THE PASSION, LET IT FLOW THROUGH YOU, PLAY HIGH VOLUME, WAKE YOUR GRANDMA
    UP (even from the afterlife if that''s the case, RIP)!**


    Notice the flawless delivery, the way you can make out the words. The way even
    the few moments you can''t it slides so seamlessly over the beat. The way you
    shudder, feeling both agony and cathartic sadness and rage and yet happy and peaceful
    all at once.


    It''s all an art. It''s a fucking masterpiece.

    Never lazy, always encouraging high quality rhyme schemes, delivery and flow.
    Always.


    Apathy and Vinnie were so indisputably skilled that often they''d actually not
    do too much together on AOTP because they knew each would hardcarry the other
    artists in tracks (but they still did have a lot of synergy when performing).


    I am only showing you the masterpieces they did together.


    If I had chosen AOTP instead of the duo, this debate would have been too easy
    for me.

    Now, for several from the same album (the one with Sumerians from Round 1). This
    album you really realise what Ap and Paz can do when together on majority of tracks
    in an album. It is PURE FIRE


    **In Death Reborn (album) (they aren''t together in every track but this album
    was their brainchild and they are together here more than usual)**\

    Paz and Apathy for life. Full respect.


    Understand that I intentionally handicapped myself by not allowing me to use all
    AOTP stuff. There''s so much fire there, so much. Apathy and Vinnie are only together
    in the same track sometimes as both were known to be monsters and hardcarry tracks
    with other artists on it but Listen to this:

    a fusion, a unity between all the artists involved:

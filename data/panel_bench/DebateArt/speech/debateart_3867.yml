  content: "To be absolutely clear, Pro (me) is arguing for the hard g sound at the\
    \ beginning of GIF, whereas Con is arguing for the soft g sound. These are denoted\
    \ as \"g\" and \"\u02A4\" respectively by the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)\
    \ but for simplicity's sake I will be using \"j\" for the latter as it is always\
    \ (as far as I can find) a \"\u02A4\" sound in the English language. [\\[1\\]](https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/)\n\
    \nArguments\n\n1. Consistency With Acronym's Components\n\nIn the acronym, the\
    \ \"G\" stands for \"Graphics\" which uses the \"g\" sound. [\\[2\\]](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/graphics)\\\
    \nBy default, it would make more sense for the \"G\" in the acronym to reflect\
    \ this than to arbitrarily change it to the \"j\" sound. Someone unfamiliar with\
    \ the word \"graphics\" might assume if they heard GIF with a \"j\" sound that\
    \ it was similarly pronounced \"jraphics\" or \"\u02A4\u0279\xE6f\u026Aks\" in\
    \ IPA notation.\n\n2. Historical Use Of The Letter \"G\"\n\nWhat we call the letter\
    \ \"G\" today was introduced as a variant of \"C\" which made both the \"g\" and\
    \ \"k\" noises in Latin at the time. Since then, it has confusingly been used\
    \ as both the \"g\" and \"j\" sound, until J was adopted into use in the 1600s.\n\
    \n3. Distinction From The Brand Jif\n\nJif is a popular brand of peanut butter\
    \ that is pronounced with the soft g noise \"j\" which is universal to the letter\
    \ J in English. It was introduced in 1956 and predates the word GIF by 31 years.\
    \ While there exist several homonyms in the English language (most notably two,\
    \ to, and too), to avoid confusion, it is reasonable to substitute a different\
    \ pronunciation when possible. For instance the present and future tense of \"\
    read\" are different in pronunciation (homophones with reed and red, respectively)\
    \ in order to more easily identify the tense. (One could go into how the past\
    \ tense should be standardized as readed, but I'm not here to fight the entire\
    \ English language today)\n\nIn Conclusion\\\nIt is straightforwardly clear to\
    \ me that the most logical and least confusing pronunciation would be the hard\
    \ g \"g\" sound.\n\nSources:\\\n<https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/>\\\

    That''s a fair claim, though I was hoping to debate someone who actively supports
    JIF more than GIF.


    **Rebuttals**


    > consistency with letter annunciation consistency.


    The examples used here, "PC" and "WTF" are not acronyms like GIF is, but initialisms.
    While an acronym is pronounced as a word, (NASA, SCOTUS, etc) an intialism is
    read as each letter in sequence (FBI, BRB, etc.) Clearly different rules do apply
    to acronyms.


    **Steve Wilhite**


    The creator of the GIF does indeed prefer the pronunciation JIF, but does an author''s
    intent matter more than popular usage? It''s easy to say no. As you said regarding
    the letter C, pronunciation evolves over time. We may not know who first started
    using C for the "k" sound, but his intent and preference didn''t stop us from
    changing the pronunciation to also cover the "s" sound. If GIF is the more popular
    usage, then the author''s intent is meaningless.


    **Distinction From The Brand Jif**


    > the peanut butter company could never sue him


    I wasn''t arguing a case for legal distinction, but to avoid confusion. While
    normal conversation may allow for context to differentiate the two, other mediums,
    such as speech to text software, have no ability to tell them apart, seeing as
    they''re pronounced exactly the same "jif"


    > gift'' is not only sounding similar to GIF


    Although this is anecdotal, I have never had trouble differentiating the two.
    If one was slurring their speech then enunciation could be a problem here, but
    again, this would only happen in a spoken conversation, where clarification could
    easily be reached. In text, I expect the confusion to drop, as completely tacking
    on or forgetting a letter is pretty hard to do.


    > **they are equally valid if we get technical**


    "_**most people have ended up saying it with hard G**_ but they are wrong."\

    This directly contradicts your earlier argument that the pronunciation of letters
    can evolve over time from the original usage. Popular use is the final arbiter
    of what is "correct." The entire dictionary is founded on this principle. "Awesome"
    and "Awful" used to have almost identical meaning, but they have undergone semantic
    drift, and now have very different meanings from each other.


    **R2 Arguments**


    **Popular use**


    In 2019 Cambridge University released an [article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-today/article/obama-scuba-or-gift/0057DB6B7B1FAABBE3112342FE14E27D)
    about the controversy on the pronunciation of GIF. In it they cite a poll finding
    that 57% of people use the hard G, while only 31% use the soft G "j". Nearly _twice_
    as many people use the hard G. They also mention how anomalous such a large split
    is, when it comes to language. There is a concept called [linguistic prescriptivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription)
    that refers to how, excepting for regional differences (such as British vs American
    English), a single "correct" usage for a word will develop. This usage can be
    influenced by anything from public speakers to dictionaries, but is ultimately
    decided by the population using the term. The most likely reason given for such
    a large split is that Wilhite''s public arguments for JIF has "given an impetus"
    to a second argument. The article also mentions that before Wilhite''s speech
    at the 2013 Emmy''s Awards, there was little recorded controversy over the term.


    **Steve Wilhite**


    Even if you lend a certain credence to the creator''s preference, [Wilhite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wilhite)
    died earlier this year. As the figurehead for the JIF movement fades into obscurity,
    linguistic drift will make the more popular pronunciation even more pronounced,
    no pun intended.


    > For Pro to win, GIF has to completely win as the correct one.


    GIF is already the more popular usage. While I predict this will solidify to supremacy
    within the next few decades, if not years, there will likely always be a few obstinate
    people that cling to JIF. So how does one judge "correctness"? In the description
    I defined "should"


    > should: modal verb (DUTY);\

    > used to say or ask what is the correct **or best** thing to do:


    The _best_ thing to do is to reduce confusion and argument in favor of the more
    readily accepted pronunciation: GIF with a hard G.

    There is a huge difference between how morals, science, and politics are determined
    and how language is. The definition, usage, and pronunciation of a word are inherently
    subject to popular usage (again, see [semantic drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change)).
    In contrast, science is explicitly based upon empirical observations, and morality
    is based upon philosophical reasoning.


    There is no shortage of examples as to how popular usage is the final arbiter
    of correctness in language. I have given a few examples already, such as the recent
    split between "awesome" and "awful." Another example is how slang can supersede
    or add to the traditional definition of a word, such as "[cool](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cool)",
    "[salty](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/salty)", or "[dope](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dope)."
    This is also how new words are entered into the dictionary, based upon increasing
    popularity.

    I merely made a distinction between initialisms and acronyms, which do inherently
    have different pronunciation rules. Your new acronym examples, PIN and SCUBA,
    are indeed inconsistent to the initial letter sound of each component word. However,
    you will also commonly see such words enter usage as its own word separate from
    the acronym ([scuba](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scuba), [laser](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/laser),
    and [radar](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/radar) all have entries
    in the dictionary separate from the original acronyms). Some consider GIF to enter
    this field as well.

    While I do not contend that these are inconsistent, it is notable that most inconsistencies

    It''s a company name, they can pronounce it either way. And it''s clearly not
    irrelevant, it''s a reflection of the popularity of the hard g for GIF.

    Has a company founder announced this? If not, you are only postulating.

    I never disagreed that the creator intended the soft g. You have yet to show an
    argument that states why this one man''s preference outweighs the clear popularity
    of the hard g.

    to be said so as to differentiate itfrom a gift when it is a GIF was... soft g
    Jif.


    Now the hypocrisy is revealed. In R1 you stated


    > they are both equally valid and will be pushing both at once.


    Con is unable to maintain a consistent stance on whether the usage of only the
    soft j or if both are acceptable. His original stance, that both are acceptable,
    would clearly be more confusing than if only one pronunciation was used. He has
    changed stances to try and make his position more sensible.

    against him.


    Then, Pro decides that the more popular one is automatically the one we should
    use even though the popular one was the unjustified deviation and Jif was the
    original pronunciation that the creator and many official sources encouraged and
    used.


    Pro said Jif peanut butter vs Jif justifies using hard ''g''Gif but I pointed
    out that the word ''gift'' has far mire overlap and grounds for co fusion there
    considering how it is used in a sentence and how commonplace a word it is.


    I feel Pro has tried to goalpost move the BoP of the debate to be that the one
    more use is via truism the one we should use. That is wrong and abusive, please
    vote accordingly.

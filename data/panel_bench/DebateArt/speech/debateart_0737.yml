  content: 'Simply citing a website is not an argument. Because of that, all I must
    prove wrong are the points that you specifically said.


    **DNA Relatives**


    You say that DNA "proves" that every living thing is related, but this is not
    true. Even the article you cited only says it "strongly suggests" it.


    The only way that this conclusion can be reached is with the presupposition that
    a God doesn''t exist. However, those of us who do believe in God reach a completely
    different conclusion. In our view, it is overwhelming evidence of intelligent
    design. For example, for this to work, an editing process would have to exist
    from the beginning of time at the SAME TIME that DNA came into existence. If not,
    the DNA would mutate itself so much that it would cease to exist. It requires
    immense faith to believe that this happened by chance.


    Another matter is that not all life forms have standard DNA.


    **Intermediate Evolutionary Stages**


    If this point is true, we should be up to our necks in transitional fossils. However,
    the truth is that we are not. If you go to the Wikipedia page of transitional
    fossils, there are not even 200. \[1\]


    This makes no sense because there should be millions, according to the theory
    of evolution. Besides this, there are no transitional fossils between taxonomic
    groups (60% vertebrate and 40% invertebrate). Evolutionists claim that there are,
    but they are always disproven with time. \[2\]


    **Vestigial Characteristics**


    Creationists aren''t against the idea that animals can lose features which are
    useless, so this doesn''t help your point. It can go either way. It is gaining
    new features that creationists have problems with. \[3\]


    **Symbiotic Relationships**


    Symbiotic relationships are completely different from evolution. For example,
    there are some fish which have other fish clean their teeth. However, in the evolutionary
    worldview, both species would have to evolve at the SAME TIME to have such a behavior.
    There are MANY symbiotic relationships, so this is not even remotely possible
    unless it is in the creationist worldview.\

    Contained within that website are proofs of evolution, it is also part of my argument
    since I''m using it as a source. If you ignore it, you are leaving evidence of
    evolution which I have presented undisputed.

    Even if I were to give you the benefit of the doubt and concede that not "all"
    life on earth is related, the genetic links between the vast majority of species
    is still undeniable. which indicates evolution even for the species which aren''t
    connected in any known way. How do you explain the fact that we are genetically
    related to other hominids and apes? Was God trouble shooting and making numerous
    prototypes before he made humans or something?


    > The only way that this conclusion can be reached is with the presupposition

    The only way the evidence for evolution can be denied is with the presupposition
    that creationism is true.

    > beginning of time at the SAME TIME that DNA came into existence. If not,

    This claim is entirely unsubstantiated. Please provide evidence that DNA would
    "mutate itself out of existence" without an "editing process" that must have necessarily
    popped into existence simultaneously.


    > It requires immense faith to believe that this happened by chance.


    No one thinks DNA was created by chance, it happened because of a gradual series
    of interactions between organic molecules according to the laws of nature, and
    although it is not known precisely how it happened it wasn''t an instantaneous
    thing that fell into place perfectly all at once.


    > Another matter is that not all life forms have standard DNA.


    Not all life forms are entirely alive either, such as viruses.


    > we should be up to our necks in transitional fossils.


    Not necessarily, although there are enough to support my position. There are enough
    to clearly see examples of organisms adapting to their environment, such as homo
    ancestors transitioning from long-armed-tree-swingers into bipedal-plain-walkers.
    Fossilisation is a privilege, not a right. There is no guarantee of an abundance
    of fossil evidence, many bones do not fossilise at all, and those that do are
    often smashed to pieces and/or eroded by geology and weather. A huge amount of
    the species that have ever existed are unknown to mankind, so you have no excuse
    to say their should be more fossil evidence if evolution is true and there is
    no sound counter-argument or equally valid alternate theory for the evidence there
    already is.

    This does not follow at all. You will need to provide more of a basis for the
    claim that organisms must evolve "at the same time" to be symbiotic.

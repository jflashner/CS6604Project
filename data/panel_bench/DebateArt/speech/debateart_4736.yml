    A military conflict between the US and China is much more likely than one between
    the US and Russia.

    With that being said, the UK, Germany, and France could easily defeat Russia.
    Those three countries have a collective nominal GDP of $10.35 trillion and a population
    of 214 million compared to Russia''s nominal GDP of $1.78 trillion and population

    This comparison does not take into account that NATO includes an additional 27
    member countries (excluding the US).\[[3](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_52044.htm)\]
    The problem is that many NATO members do not spend a lot on defense, since the
    US protects them.\[[4](https://www.newsweek.com/majority-nato-nations-fail-spend-2-percent-gdp-guideline-defense-1694014)\]
    It is in the interest of the US and Europe to have these countries dramatically
    increase their defense budgets before the US needs to redirect its military away
    from Russia and towards China. The US stating it will leave NATO soon would accomplish
    this goal.

    US might spend more money on domestic policy as well. There is a limited number
    of recourse and European nations spending enough to defend to themselves is reasonable
    and fair. In fact, the US subsidizing them is unfair to Americans.


    GDP is a crucial factor to determine military capability, since countries with
    higher GDPs can spend more money on defense technologies and soldiers. Western
    European countries are very rich and can spend enough to defend themselves and
    outspend the Russians in fact, as previously explained. Western European countries
    have more people than Russia, which means they could have more soldiers has well.


    Chief of Naval Operations ADM Gilday say the Navy cannot handle two wars at once.\[[1](https://www.13newsnow.com/article/news/national/military-news/chief-naval-operations-says-navy-not-prepared-to-handle-two-wars-at-once/291-89e465f9-1f34-4748-b1a6-a2980ace86c1)\]

    two wars at once.\[[2](https://nypost.com/2022/10/18/us-military-rated-as-weak-may-not-be-able-to-win-one-war-as-tensions-grow-with-china-russia/)\]
    European countries need to spend more on defense before the US is forced to abandon
    them and fight China.

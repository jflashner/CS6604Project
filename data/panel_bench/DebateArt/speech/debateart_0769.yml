  content: "I will name 5 reasons (premises) why the border wall is bad for the U.\
    \ S. Just to clarify, this is not border walls in general, but specifically, the\
    \ border wall that the President is advocating for. The reasons are as follows:\n\
    \n1. _It will not stop drug trafficking._\n2. _It will not stop illegal immigration._\n\
    3. _It promotes xenophobia._\n4. _It wastes an enormous amount of money._\n5.\
    \ _It wastes time and labor._\n\n**Premise 1**\n\nExperts have shown that the\
    \ majority of drugs are not coming across the border, But across legal ports of\
    \ entry.\n\n_\"According to U. S. Customs and Border Protection statistics, 90\
    \ percent of heroin seized along the border, 88 percent of cocaine, 87 percent\
    \ of methamphetamine, And 80 percent of fentanyl in the first 11 months of the\
    \ 2018 fiscal year was caught trying to be smuggled in at legal crossing points.\
    \ \"_ \\[1\\]\n\nBesides this, Drug smugglers themselves have admitted the same\
    \ facts:\\\n_\". . . Intelligence received from arrested smugglers and law enforcement\
    \ partners in Mexico indicate that cartels clearly prefer moving high-profit narcotics\
    \ through the busy ports of entry because their chances of success are better\
    \ there. . . the sheer volume of traffic means smugglers' odds are still better\
    \ going through there than other parts of the border. . . Vice President Mike\
    \ Pence was the first to acknowledge in an op-ed column published in USA TODAY\
    \ on Tuesday that those drugs \"primarily\" enter the country through ports of\
    \ entry. . . Several of \\[El Chapo's\\] cartel members have testified that they\
    \ mostly pushed drugs through U. S. Ports of entry. . . None. . . Testified that\
    \ they moved drugs through the open border regions in between those ports.\"_\
    \ \\[1\\]\n\nClearly, The border wall will not be able to stop drug trafficking.\\\
    \n**Premise 2**\n\nWays to get into the U. S. When a border wall is present:\\\
    \nThrough:\n\n_\"One storm in Texas left a hole for months. Fences and walls can\
    \ also erode near rivers or beaches, As the one in San Diego did. And they can\
    \ be penetrated: Some fencing can be cut in minutes, And the Border Patrol reported\
    \ repairing more than 4, 000 holes in one year alone. \"_ \\[2\\]\n\nOver:\n\n\
    _\"Much of the current fencing can be easily mounted with a ladder or from the\
    \ roof of a truck. In some cases, Border crossers can scale the fence without\
    \ any additional equipment. One viral video from 2010 shows two women easily climbing\
    \ an 18-foot steel bollard-style pedestrian fence in less than 20 seconds. Smugglers\
    \ can even drive over the fence using ramps. . . \"_ \\[2\\]\n\nUnder:\n\n_\"\
    Tunnels are typically used more for drug smuggling, But they still create a significant\
    \ vulnerability in any kind of physical barrier. From 2007 to 2010, The Border\
    \ Patrol found more than one tunnel per month, On average. \u201CFor every tunnel\
    \ we find, We feel they\u2019re building another one somewhere\". . A wall would\
    \ likely increase the rewards for successful tunneling as other modes of transit\
    \ grow more expensive. \"_ \\[2\\]\n\nThrough Gaps:\n\n_\"Border Patrol agents\
    \ have told Fox News that a border wall would still \u201Chave to allow water\
    \ to pass through, Or the sheer force of raging water could damage its integrity.\
    \ . . In 2011, For example, A flood in Arizona washed away 40 feet of steel fence.\
    \ \"_ \\[2\\]\n\nClearly, A border wall can do nothing to stop a determined immigrant.\\\
    \nPremise 3:\n\nIf a border wall goes up, Our children will learn about it. They\
    \ will grow up being told that \"we have to keep the bad people out.\" This will\
    \ only serve to increase xenophobia, which incorrectly criminalizes innocent people.\\\
    \n**Premise 4**\n\nAs I have already shown, The border wall will accomplish none\
    \ of the goals for which it was built. It is a waste of billions of dollars, Which\
    \ can go to sectors such as:\n\n- Welfare\n- Public services (libraries, Fire\
    \ departments, Etc. )\n- Public transportation\n- Fixing public buildings and\
    \ streets\n- Reducing the national debt\n- Public education\n\n**Premise 5**\n\
    \nHow long will it take to build the border wall?\n\n_\"One expert. . . Recently\
    \ estimated that it could take 11 years for 10, 000 workers to build 1, 000 miles\

  content: 'Donald Trump''s wall has been a suggested solution for curbing illegal
    immigration into the US. While being heavily opinionated upon partisan lines and
    accordingly criticised, I will attempt to show that the wall is a good idea and
    hence should be built.


    **1. Illegal immigrants negatively impact the United States and its inhabitants**


    Within this past decade, there has been an estimated average of around 11 million
    illegal immigrants residing in the United States. [\[1\]](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/11/28/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/)
    These illegal immigrants take part in the usage of taxpayer funded resources such
    as medical care and public education, with many experts estimating the ultimate
    cost for these resources to be at least several billions. One such estimation
    is calculated to be at least 116 billion per year. [\[2\]](http://www.fairus.org/issue/publications-resources/fiscal-burden-illegal-immigration-united-states-taxpayers)
    Needless to say, the usage of these taxpayer resources places unfair burden on
    these systems which should be used for the benefit of actual citizens.


    **2. Walls are an effective deterrent to land-based crossers**


    Barriers have historically been an effective deterrent against foreign invaders,
    and this applies to contemporary times as well. There have been multiple modern
    cases where walls have been erected and have effectively restricted passage across
    particular sections of land. For example, after construction of the wall in Yuma,
    Arizona in 2005, there there 138,438 apprehensions of illegal immigrants compared
    to 26,244 the previous year. [\[3\]](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/columnists/byron-york-in-border-talks-a-new-fight-for-barrier-deniers)
    Internationally, the wall constructed in Israel has dramatically helped curbed
    illegal migrants after its construction, with there being about 9500 illegal migrants
    before, to about 36, 11 and 0 in 2013, 2016 and 2017 respectively. [\[4\]](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Israels-border-walls-A-case-study-For-Trumps-mantra-574517)
    There is little doubt that walls are effective in preventing land-based crossings
    and a border wall across the United States-Mexico is unlikely to be an exception.


    Clearly, if illegal immigrants negatively impact the United States and its inhabitants,
    and a wall is a valid solution, the only conclusion can be that a wall should
    be built.

  content: "My opponent's main argument is that a wall is effective and that it will\
    \ stop illegal immigration. He cites the wall in Yuma, Arizona, and Israel as\
    \ proof of the effectiveness of walls. Firstly, the wall in Yuma was shown not\
    \ to have done this alone.\n\n\\_\"\\__These projects did not lead to significant\
    \ declines in border crossings, according to the data. Monthly border apprehensions\

  content: 'My opponent has argued against the wall with five points. However, I note
    that the five points may be essentially boiled down to three and will attempt
    to rebute them in such a manner


    **Premise 1 & premise 2: It will not stop drug trafficking and it will not stop
    illegal immigration.**


    I have condensed these two points into one argument because they essentially are
    both arguments that the wall is meaningless as it would not achieve anything if
    built. I have already made arguments addressing the efficacy of border walls,
    so I will proceed to negate the arguments made


    Firstly, my opponent suggests that the border wall will not stop drug trafficking.


    While understandably this is a common talking point, on its own it does not sufficiently
    negate the necessity of a border wall. Clearly, if a wall were completely ineffective
    at preventing drug trafficking and yet were effective at preventing illegal immigrants
    or vise-versa, it can be reasonably argued that the wall should still be built
    for one or the other.


    Secondly, my opponent suggests that the border wall will not stop illegal immigration
    because it can be breached. He does this by providing examples of how walls and
    fences can be breached.


    However these examples are insufficient to express the inadequacy of walls. This
    is for several reasons


    1. Some of the examples just aren''t applicable. Trumps wall is just that, a wall
    and not a fence with wires to cut through as was given as an example. To suggest
    otherwise is a mischaracterization of the structure that Trump has proposed, which
    in it''s ideal form has been asserted to be solid concrete.


    2. Some of these examples have been cherry-picked to established a less than favourable
    view of walls. For example, how often do floods and storms occur with such strength
    to penetrate concrete walls and leave holes which are then subsequently left unrepaired
    for months? My opponent has insinuated that such events occur frequently enough
    to render a concrete wall useless, and I would certainly be delighted if he could
    provide evidence for this.


    3. Most of these examples are contingent on poor design. For example my opponent
    suggests tunnels are an effective method of bypassing the wall. However this may
    be negated by extended the wall sufficiently below ground level. Equally, a ladder
    may be negated in most cases by building the wall sufficiently high enough. If
    a structure does not sufficiently meet requirements, it is pertinent to modify
    the structure so that it does. Not, as my opponents suggests, to ignore the flaws
    and build it regardless.


    4. My opponent has expressed that because of these examples, a wall cannot stop
    a determined immigrant. However this does not address the walls overall impact
    on illegal immigration and hence achieving its purpose.


    **Premise 3: It promotes xenophobia**


    My opponent make the claim that by putting up a wall, the children will learn
    about it and grow up being told that "we have to keep the bad people out". This
    in turn will increase xenophobia in your future children.


    This line of logic is erroneous for several reasons


    1. It is not inherently xenophobic to block foreign invaders from entering your
    country, which illegal immigration essentially is

    2. Migrants are welcomed to the United States through legal channels regardless
    of whether a wall is put up or not

    3. Children are a product of their upbringing. Xenophobia cannot be taught by
    an inanimate object, only by their experiences growing up. Unless my opponent
    is also arguing that placing up a wall simultaneously decreases parenting skills
    nationwide, future generations are unlikely to become more xenophobic just from
    the building of the wall

    4. The argument is entirely prophetic in nature with little basis in evidence
    and cannot be reasonably asserted to be a likely outcome to any degree of accuracy


    **Premise 4 & premise 5: It wastes an enormous amount of money and it wastes time
    and labor**


    I have lumped these two premises together as they are both centered around the
    idea that the wall will not perform the desired functions, and hence will be a
    waste of money, time and labour. I note that these arguments presuppose and focus
    on the complete impotence of the wall without addressing these factors in the
    context of at the very least a minimally functioning wall, hence the word "waste"
    over comparative phrases such as "not worth" or "too high". As such, it is sufficient
    to simply argue that the wall will achieve desired functionality to negate these
    premises. Since I have already made such an argument, I will leave these two premises
    as they are.

  content: "**Drug Trafficking**\n\nMy opponent does not respond to my argument on\
    \ drug trafficking except to state that it alone is not a reason to stop the border\
    \ wall. Because of this, I think this shows that he agrees that the border wall\
    \ doesn\u2019t stop drugs or he would have responded to my arguments.\n\n**Illegal\
    \ Immigration**\n\n> 1. Some of the examples just aren't applicable. Trumps wall\

    \ that it could be broken. \\[1\\]\n\n> 2. Some of these examples have been cherry-picked\

    \ for this.\n\nMy opponent straw-manned my argument. I did not say that the wall\
    \ shouldn\u2019t be built because it is frequently flooded. I said that it will\
    \ have gaps (where rivers and other natural elements are) that immigrants can\
    \ go through. My opponent ignored this.\n\nAs to holes created, it happened twice\
    \ in one week in Arizona. That\u2019s pretty frequent. \\[4\\] In the same area,\
    \ it is said that it floods regularly and that the wall becomes a dam for the\
    \ water, but as more water builds up, it gets more force and more strain is put\
    \ on the wall. \\[5\\]\n\n> 3. Most of these examples are contingent on poor design.\

    \ it is pertinent to modify the structure so that it does. Not, as my opponents\
    \ suggests, to ignore the flaws and build it regardless.\n\nThe tests that the\
    \ government tested extended a minimum of 6 feet under ground. However, there\
    \ have been over 50 tunnels found along San Diego, which has one of the most fortified\
    \ walls along the border, one being 90 feet underground. \\[1\\] **Remember, we\u2019\
    re arguing about TRUMP\u2019S wall**, not some theoretical untested wall that\
    \ my opponent makes out of thin air. The wall that estimates have been given for\
    \ is the one with a 10 feet tunnel guard, and the price comes in at over $30 billion.\
    \ The problem is that immigrants will just dig under it, like the 90 foot tunnel.\n\
    \nAs to the ladder argument, tests show that the higher the wall is, the more\
    \ prone it is to falling. \\[1\\] The estimates that I just talked about are only\
    \ for 30 foot walls.\n\n> 4. My opponent has expressed that because of these examples,\
    \ a wall cannot stop a determined immigrant. However this does not address the\
    \ walls overall impact on illegal immigration and hence achieving its purpose.\n\
    \nYes, it does.\n\n**Xenophobia**\n\nAllow me to clarify. Trump has frequently\
    \ been cited as building the wall because Mexicans are animals \\[2\\], drug dealers,\
    \ criminals, and rapists. That is quite obviously xenophobic. And in case you\
    \ want to use the defense that he said \u201Cand some, I assume, are good people,\u201D\
    \ that statement obviously concludes that the rest of Mexicans aren\u2019t good\
    \ people. He said **some** are good people, not **most** and not **a majority.**\n\

    \ illegal immigration alone. My opponent uses this quote to support his claim\n\
    \n> \"These projects did not lead to significant declines in border crossings,\
    \ according to the data. Monthly border apprehensions in both El Centro and El\

    \ the replacement of walls, not the construction of new walls entirely. It is\
    \ reasonable to assume that a wall before being replaced by another wall achieves\

    \ To conclude the efficacy of a replacement wall, without even considering the\

    \ Palestinians against the respective border walls. [\\[2\\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-22/israeli-finance-minister-sees-west-bank-economy-key-to-peace)\
    \ I can only assume my opponent has conceded that the Israel border wall is an\
    \ example of border wall efficacy\n\nMy opponent finally claims that\n\n1. The\
    \ US border wall will be longer than either of the examples I provided\n2. Walls\
    \ only work because of major surveillance and/or guarding along the border\n3.\
    \ Guarding a larger wall will be more difficult than guarding a smaller wall\n\
    \nFirstly, my opponents second claim is a distortion of what his sources note.\
    \ His sources do not state that walls are **only** effective with major surveillance\
    \ and/or guarding. There is a stark difference between travelling unhindered and\
    \ being hindered by barriers. Were I to surround my opponent's house in walling\
    \ he would have an immeasurably more difficult time leaving his house than if\
    \ I were to not surround his house in walling.\n\nAs my opponent's source notes,\n\
    \n> \"No matter their original purpose, some basic principles behind walls remain\
    \ timeless. Walls do work, at least for a time. There is a reason, after all,\
    \ why states across the centuries have turned to walls as solutions to strategic\
    \ quagmires. \" [\\[3\\]](https://www.rand.org/blog/2019/01/what-border-walls-can-and-cannot-accomplish.html)\n\
    \nSecondly, difficulty is not an argument in itself against the completion of\
    \ a task or goal without weighing the difficulty in relation to the end goal and\
    \ success. For example, developing cures for cancers can be considered to be quite\
    \ difficult and yet many would consider such researches to be a worthwhile endeavors\
    \ despite the difficulties. In this case, the end goals are the reduction of the\
    \ presence of illegal aliens within the country and the fortification of national\
    \ borders. Apart from this, there have been many cases where walls have been successful\
    \ such as the examples I previously made. Hence, difficulty is not an argument\
    \ as to whether a wall should be built.\n"

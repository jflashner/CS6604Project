    \ a blanket statement.**\n\nThe blanket statement that the movement is founded\
    \ in is this: The police are racist.\n\nMy argument is simple. Not ALL police\
    \ are racist. In fact, I think the vast vast majority aren't. That statement is\
    \ very unfair. That's like saying, \"everyone who lives in Green Bay is a cheese\
    \ head.\" Which isn't true. There is at least one person in Green Bay who isn't\
    \ a cheese head, so it is unfair to categorize them as such.\\\nAnd doing things\
    \ such as making socks with pigs in police hats on them is just flat-out wrong\
    \ and I think it is ridiculous that anyone would do that. I think it's fair to\

    \ I think it's foolish to say that the only racist race is whites.\n\nPoint #2:\
    \ **What they're doing is not the right way to deal with this \"problem\".**\n\
    \nThings like profiling police officers as all being racist and making pig police\
    \ socks to pigeonhole the police is wrong as well. I think that two wrongs don't\
    \ make a right and to do that because of so called inequality in a country where\
    \ no laws exist that discriminate is downright ignorant.\n\nPoint #3: **Racial\
    \ equality already exists in this country.**\n\nName to me one law, one legislation\
    \ that discriminates against blacks or any minority for that matter. In fact,\
    \ most policies in place by employers and colleges look to give minorities a better\
    \ chance at being enrolled in a college or hired at a job. Just because a group\

    justice system;"


    The definition of systematic is as follows; "done or acting according to a fixed
    plan or system; methodical.".\

    According to a fixed plan or system, AKA laws. And you yourself said there are
    no laws that call out certain races and give them a disadvantage. You conceded
    that.


    "Considering that criminal justice reform is at the top of the list of the issues
    for which players have risked their careers to illuminate."


    Colin Kaepernick waited until he was no longer a starter and was playing badly
    to be an activist for anything. He sacrificed nothing. Especially since I''m sure
    he''s making millions of dollars partnering with Nike.


    "Who said that ALL police are racists? I don''t think that that is an argument

    It''s implied with those socks.\

    So you agree that racism isn''t a problem? Thank you I guess.


    I don''t care about what''s in someone''s head as much as what they do. There''s
    not a way to scientifically study something such as implicit bias, so we''re swinging
    at ghosts effectively. Also, implicit bias isn''t solid enough to hold up in a
    court room which is why it''s never been used in a courtroom as evidence for any
    case. I don''t care about what people think in their head so much as if they act
    on it because I''m not a mind reader.


    To your source, how would they know that???It still doesn''t explain how the test
    works, it explains what the test does and how it is administered, but no hint
    to how it works. Granted I did scan the article, but if you want to explain to
    me exactly how it works, please do that.


    If there are no laws that are racist, what exactly are you fighting?


    No, I''m not triggered by cartoons on socks, I disagree with how that group of
    people is handling the situation. To call cops pigs is obviously extremely disrespectful
    and it''s obvious when you look at how Nike is making those socks, that it is
    because of the Colin Kaepernick movement. I don''t need to explain the correlation
    there.


    "It is a fact that job applicants with black sounding names are less likely to
    get a response, even with identical resumes. I see nothing wrong with policies
    that attempt to correct this problem."


    "Black sounding names", that''s racist. And maybe that has nothing to do with
    their race, and more to do with the fact that those names are harder to pronounce.
    The same reason support people from India make up white washed names so that people
    don''t have to say the "indian sounding names". It''s not to do with the names,
    but rather that their names are harder to pronounce, and when dealing with people,
    you don''t want them struggling to say your name.

    It''s not

    The fact that some people are born with names that prevent their

    Please give me an example of that. You can''t just say "institutional racism".
    You have to tell me what institution/group of people is racist and if there is
    not reasonable doubt that it is racist, I''ll fight it with you. I''m not a racist.
    I just genuinely don''t think that this country''s laws/justice system is racist.\

    What institutions are set up that result in bad conditions for black people? You
    have to be specific, you can''t just say the justice system either, because that''s
    too broad. That''s like going into the doctor and saying, "I hurt". And expecting

    "First, increasing school spending has rarely led to better outcomes. Second,
    and more fundamentally, based on data from the U.S. Department of Education itself,
    the assumed funding disparities between racial and ethnic groups _do not exist_."\

    Colin Kaepernick went 1-10 in his last year in the NFL and got taken off the starter
    position before advocating for anything like that. He got more money from Nike
    than he would have gotten from the 49ers.\

    But still, no specifics, at all. Stop and frisk is not racist. Provide proof for
    the crack vs coke thing. Also,"variations in crime cause for variation in sentencing."
    Also, BAME offenders are less likely to plea guilty, which isn''t taken into account.


    "The fact that some people are born with names that prevent their career growth

    Your name is as hard to control as your economic status. You should hire based
    on merit. I agree with you there. I don''t think affirmative action is a justifiable
    way to solve that problem, but yes I agree that employers shouldn''t refrain from
    hiring someone based on their name. We can agree on that.


    Thanks for the civility, I hope this debate is productive for you as it is for
    me! :D

    Kaepernick is addressing in his movement is the police. The practices of police

    officers racially profiling black and Latino people is an example of institutional

    racism. Stop and frisk data shows that only 3% of those stopped are actually

    convicted of a crime. What this means is that 97% of these people, who are

    mostly minorities are being stopped and harassed simply because of their race.
    Because

    of this discrepancy, black and Latino people are incarcerated at higher rates

    than white people even though the crimes are committed at the same rate, this

    results in a disproportionate number of prisoners being black.


    <https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/14/stop-and-frisk-new-york-conviction-rate>


    Despite

    being nearly identical to cocaine, crack is treated as a considerably worse

    drug when it comes to sentencing for possession. There is currently an 18:1

    sentencing disparity, which means crack users (who are mostly black) are being

    unfairly targeted with these laws.

    So you can provide percentages for conviction rates, but not what percentage of

    but you provide no evidence or statistics to back you up. The conviction rate
    alone doesn''t prove your point.

    The Fair Sentencing Act removed the 5-year minimum sentence just for general possession
    of crack. But a big reason for this is because of the trends of violence that
    came with crack use, especially in urban areas. That came from your own source.


    "The disparity in cocaine penalties grew out of the skyrocketing use of crack
    in the 1980s and the trends in violence that accompanied it, especially in urban
    areas. Indeed, there appears to be more violence associated with crack offenses.
    U.S. Sentencing Commission statistics show that 29 percent of all crack cases
    from October 1, 2008, through September 30,2009, involved a weapon, compared to
    16 percent for powder cocaine."\

    "So you acknowledge that a problem exists with names and hiring but you don''t

    No, I''m saying that that isn''t a race thing. Not relevant.

    According to the Washington Post, mind you this is the Washington Post, not a
    right winged source. Grand total of people shot and killed by the police this
    year, 798. Grand total of black people shot and killed by the police this year,
    158. Grand total of white people shot and killed by the police this year, 318.
    It is not statistical fact that more blacks are shot and killed by the police.
    In fact, whites have around double the deaths by police this year.\

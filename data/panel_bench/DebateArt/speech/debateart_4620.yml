    Bible in the New Testament says not to seek revenge and not to return evil for
    evil. Therefore, there is no way to make others your slaves no matter what they
    do.

    Jesus completed the law.\

    If the new updated law doesnt allow slavery, then slavery was only allowed before
    Christ, therefore before Christianity.\

    Christianity doesnt allow slavery. Therefore, slavery is not consistent with Christianity.


    This topic does not deal with The Old Testament. A lot of The Old Testament was
    abolished, such as circumcision, saturday law, revenge law..\

    If a lot of The Old Testament was abolished, then this topic does not deal with
    The Old Testament.


    > We must interpret Jesus''s teachings as consistent with the laws of Moses whenever

    If "Do to others as you would have them do to you" is not consistent with making

    "Do to others as you would have them do to you" is not consistent with making
    others slaves. You cannot make others slaves.


    > There also have been slaves who preferred being slaves to being free.


    If slave by definition is someone who is forced into being a slave, then a person
    cannot willingly be a slave.\

    Slave by definition is someone who is forced into being a slave. A person cannot
    willingly be a slave.


    > If you were a Christian who did unto others as you would have them do unto you,
    you would also do unto others as they would do unto themselves


    The conclusion doesnt logically follow.


    "Do to others as you would have them do to you" has nothing to do with "do to
    others as they would do to themselves".


    Bible says:


    "Do to others as you would have them do to you."


    If nobody can be a slave willingly, then you can only force others to be slaves
    if you wish for others to force you to be a slave.\

    Nobody can be a slave willingly. You can only force others to be slaves if you
    wish for others to force you to be a slave.


    It is not possible to wish to be forced. You cannot force others to be slaves
    and stay consistent with Christianity.\

    If its not possible to wish to be forced, then it follows that you cannot force
    others to be slaves and stay consistent with Christianity.


    > while putting yourself in the shoes of someone who wanted what they wanted as
    long as what they want isn''t a sin.


    You cannot want to be a slave. If you are serving willingly, then you are not
    a slave.


    Slave definition:\

    a person who is **forced** to work for and obey another and is considered to be
    their property; an enslaved person.

    sabbath and the ten commandments. None of that was simply thrown away due to Jesus
    who was a Jew in support of the law of Moses, unless specifically stated by Jesus.


    As someone who follows the golden rule you should also empathize with others.
    After all, just because someone is a Christian who prefers turkey doesn''t mean
    they would only give a turkey sandwich to someone who prefers ham. Quite the contrary,
    in order to fully practice the golden rule you must be able to put yourself in
    the shoes of others and do unto them as you would do if you wanted the same thing
    for them as they want for themselves just as you want what you want for yourself.


    You can highlight the word "forced" all you want and in most contexts you would
    be correct, but strictly speaking slavery is when someone owns someone else and
    doesn''t pay them for labor. Historically people have chosen to be slaves (which
    is admittedly rare and usually because the other option is even worse).


    For most of the history of Christianity, Christians have owned slaves and slavery
    has been present in society. In the vast majority of cases this was consistent
    with the reputation of force and maltreatment that slavery has and thus sinful.
    Hypothetically however, a slave''s conditions can be extremely good to the point
    that their life is far better as a slave and they wouldn''t have it any other
    way. That is what Jesus would call good Christian slavery. It is not slavery itself
    that Jesus ever claimed to have a problem with, but if anything the way slaves
    are treated and forced to work without pay without consent. If someone consents
    to being a slave and is treated well Jesus would have no problem with it.

    since the definition of slavery demands that a person is forced.


    Therefore, slavery cannot be consistent with Christianity''s rule of "Do to others
    what you would have them do to you".

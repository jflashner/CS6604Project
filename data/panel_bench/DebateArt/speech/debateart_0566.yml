  content: 'In one simple argument I can destroy any possibility of there being a
    God. The existence of God is causally impossible because in order for God to exist
    it would have to spontaneously appear from literally nothing as a fully developed
    sentient and all knowing entity. There would be nothing prior to God''s existence
    to create whatever God is made of and nothing would exist for God to "know" because
    nothing would initially exist other than God, therefore God would not exist to
    begin with but if it did it would literally know nothing. The only way to get
    around this is to postulate some type of primordial quantum loop or "possibility
    cloud" which God spawned from and draws information from, which is equally impossible
    because it requires everything to both infinitely exist and not exist at the same
    time before existence was even a thing.\

    RM posted this in the comments, I did not use it for this argument as that would
    be cheating in a way but it may be helpful for you to read this.\

  content: 'Two simple points which shall be expanded upon in the paragraphs to follow:


    First: Probably even to the point of near-certainty, does not negate possibility.


    Second: God by definition exists more than most people.


    **First**\

    Were this a debate on if God''s existence is illogical, pro would have a strong
    case. As things stand, he is arguing that because his limited understanding says
    something is not the case, it is outright impossible. This is just the logical
    fallacy known as an [augment from incredulity](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity).


    Our universe could (however much we dislike the notion) be a [simulation](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Simulated_reality).
    To commit an overt appeal to authority, even [Elon Musk](https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/science/what-simulation-hypothesis-why-some-think-life-simulated-reality-ncna913926)
    and [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation/)
    support this. God as the lead designer, fits about any definition, and exemplifies
    how God could know everything when the universe was nothing.


    **Second**\

    Merriam-Webster defines [existence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/existence)
    as **"reality as presented in experience."**


    We can say anyone who has experienced God is insane, but that does not negate
    that tangible existence. An experience so strong it has caused countless wars,
    which furthers the reality of Gods impact upon the world.


    God even as just a concept is one we''ve all experienced, to argue against this
    would be to claim that concepts don''t exist.

    I am claiming that the rules of causality render God''s existence impossible,
    which is an undeniable statement. We are talking about a sentient being who exists
    with no substance or force to bring it into existence and an all-knowing being
    who has no information to draw from. Not only is God''s mere existence impossible,
    but to think the first thing that would spawn out of literal nothingness would
    be such a complex and perfect construct is also bonkers. My understanding may
    be limited, but that does not mean the downright ludicrous can be true.

    If this is a simulation, then it wasn''t created by "God" but by some alien scientists.
    We are talking about the literal Abrahamic notion of "God" here specifically,
    the supernatural all powerful being that spawned from nothing and created everything.
    A cyborg alien with a quantum computer doesn''t fit the definition of "God".


    > Merriam-Webster defines [existence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/existence)

    Are you suggesting that if I smoke PCP and see fairies then the fairies are real
    just because the dictionary says so?


    > We can say anyone who has experienced God is insane, but that does not negate
    that tangible existence. An experience so strong it has caused countless wars,
    which furthers the reality of Gods impact upon the world.


    Yes, people believe in God, people do stuff in the name of God because they believe
    in God, this doesn''t make God real at all. When I was a kid I believed I was
    a Jedi and did stuff in the name of the Jedi order, does that make Star Wars real?


    > God even as just a concept is one we''ve all experienced, to argue against this
    would be to claim that concepts don''t exist.


    Concepts don''t exist in the way you are suggesting. If you imagine that a conceptual
    being exists than that being does not exist, it is in fact just chemicals and
    electricity in your brain creating the notion that it exists. The actual being
    still doesn''t exist.

    To have a debate in English, means exactly that. Oranges for example are generally

    To be sporting, I''ll address the remaining points...


    > I am claiming that the rules of causality render God''s existence impossible,
    which is an undeniable statement.


    Denied. Not understanding the cause of something, does not make it impossible
    that there is one. Using the simulation example, you are insisting that a simulation
    could never exist because there were things outside it which caused it. Granted
    people used to argue against the Big Bang Theory on the same basis (in spite of
    observable evidence), that since they did not know the cause of it, the universe
    must have always existed; common wisdom now [disagrees](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/brilliant-blunders/).


    > If this is a simulation, then it wasn''t created by "God" but by some alien
    scientists. ... A cyborg alien


    Thank you for weakening your own case with such a silly [straw-man](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man)
    fallacy. You''re agreeing that it''s possibly a simulation, but impossible that
    anyone involved could have been come to be known locally as God because you don''t
    know if God is a cyborg, and all beings that run simulations are cyborgs. Going
    back to the [Scientific America](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation/)
    article I previously shared, which wrote of an event attended by many physicists
    (whose job requires them to regularly run simulations) but not one mention of
    them being aliens or cyborgs was made (the attendance even one "cyborg alien with
    a quantum computer," would have overshadowed everything else at the event and
    the rest of the year''s news-cycle).


    Back to the dictionary side tangents...


    > does that make Star Wars real?


    Are you trying to argue that **The Existence of Star Wars is Impossible?** It
    would be fine if you want to move the goalpost that that. Star Wars is of course
    not historically accurate, but people do not pay out billions to see it in theater
    if it''s a blank screen and no sound.


    > Concepts don''t exist in the way you are suggesting ... it is in fact just chemicals
    and electricity in your brain creating


    Thank you for conceding that God has physical existence (even if a limited one).
    ... Pretty much to backtrack on this, you would need to deny humans exist (along
    with everything else), since we''re walking piles of chemicals and electric impulses.

    Definitions are not always so clear cut. Language itself is socially constructed
    so the definition of "blue" could be changed to "orange" and if everyone went
    along with it then that would be how it is. But more to the point, when you get
    to more abstract philosophical definitions, there will undoubtedly be some issues
    with the perspective/outlook of the ones writing the dictionary. No human truly
    understands the nature of existence in a complete sense, and to top it off you
    merely cherry picked one interpretation of the word "existence" to begin with.
    There are multiple definitions pertaining to multiple contexts and schools of
    thought.

    I couldn''t care less what people believe. In fact, this should be so obvious
    as a non-issue to any thinking person that it doesn''t even warrant rebuttal.
    For the sake of smoking PCP though I will address it. Humans believe things that
    aren''t true all the time and there are countless conflicting beliefs which are
    believed by many people. What makes you think one idea is more valid just because
    it is believed by a larger number of superstitious apes?

    What''s this, straw-manning my argument by claiming that I am claiming God is
    impossible just because I don''t understand how it could be possible when in fact
    my argument is based on the known laws of logic and causality are we? Also you
    are straw-manning by claiming that I am insisting that a simulation could never
    exist. Do you not understand the causal difference between a simulation made in
    a computer and a magic God that literally pops out of nothing?\

    As for the big bang theory I actually do not believe in that either, but at least
    it has a theoretical basis. There is literally no evidence of God and hence you
    automatically lose because thus far you have provided no evidence and a bunch
    of word salads while I have presented a sound argument.

    the rest of the year''s news-cycle).


    You''re clearly mentally unwell, which is not ad-hominem but an observation which
    in and of itself brings the validity of your claims into question. By fixating
    on the term "alien cyborg" you are completely ignoring the actual point. A simulation
    is completely different from a magic God-spirit which manifests from nothing.
    God cannot exist because of causality and probability, some entity or group creating
    a simulation in a laboratory is not the same as a perfect infallible being self
    assembling and creating the universe from nothing.\

    You seem to be less interested in the truth than you are in misrepresenting my
    arguments.

    Star Wars exists as a concept and as a work of fiction, that doesn''t mean Darth
    Vader is out there force-choking people in a galaxy far far away. You would need
    an extraordinarily infantile intellect not to see the difference.

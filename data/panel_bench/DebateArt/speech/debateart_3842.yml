  content: 'Kajiit are a better race than Argonians because they are smarter, have
    a generally higher IQ, and are highly intelligent. They have natural claws, that
    outshine some weapons in the start of the game. The Kajiit also possess night
    vision. Although the Argonians have water-breathing, the kajiit are stealthier
    and speedier. The stereotypes against the Kajiit are untrue. The Kajiit are not
    all drug dealers and thieves. Many Kajiit are only trying to get by with simple
    merchandising, body guarding, and white-hat thievery (stealing for the government,
    professional espionage, etc.).


    On the other hand, Argonians are the "devil in disguise" in my opinion. Because
    they are allowed in cities, they can have easier access to all of Skyrim''s goods.
    therefore, they are much more tempted (and prone) to stealing/scheming/scamming.
    My main concern is in Riften and especially Solitude (The Capital of Skyrim).\

    In other (non-opinionated) terms, The Argonians are canonically and factually
    an inferior. In the lore of Skyrim and the greater Elder Scrolls universe, Argonians
    have always been the thick-skinned (and thick-skulled) characters. Many a brute
    by nature, others tricksters. The only major redeeming factor for Argonians are
    the fact they can breathe under water.


    In conclusion, Kajiit are superior in a myriad of ways, mainly via the fact that
    they are sneakier, smarter, and naturally more evolved creatures. Argonians are
    unintelligent (mostly), physically inferior compared to other species, and are
    only special because they are lizard people.\

    Also, fun fact, Kajiit''s "class/build" comes from when they are born, regardless
    of the parents. If the stars align (literally), the Kajiit will come out that
    way.


    In my final conclusion, The Kajiit may have some relations with the gods of the
    Elder Scrolls universe, therefore are celestials as well as cats. So, Kajiit are
    half-god half-cat beautiful creatures and Argonians are slimy lizards with a magic
    tree that tells the future. Kajiit are better. I rest my case.

    For one, argonians successfully resisted the daedric invasion in the third era.
    Not only did they resist it, but they threatened to completely destroy the daedric
    invasion of black marsh. "The Argonian forces apparently managed to break into
    Oblivion itself, fighting and winning against the Daedra. The Dremora lieutenants
    were forced to close their own Gates to prevent being overrun, something unheard
    of anywhere else." ([1](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/An-Xileel_Daedric_resistance)).
    Of the information we have available, the argonians did better than any other
    race or province during the oblivion crisis.


    Secondly, argonians can breathe underwater. Without potions and enchantments,
    this is impossible for a khajiit. The extent of this advantage is difficult to
    fully describe, but it is a breeze for argonians to explore shipwrecks or avoid
    otherwise disastrous confrontations by simply swimming away, deeper and longer
    than any other race naturally can.


    From a gaming standpoint, the usefulness of claws vs water breathing is barely
    comparable, since weapons are abundant even in the introductory mission of Skyrim,
    such as the iron battle-axe, which has a base damage of 16 ([2](<https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Iron_Battleaxe_(Skyrim)>))
    vs the khajiit claws base damage of 12 ([3](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit#:~:text=Traits%5Bedit%5D,magnitude%20is%20only%2012%20points)).
    From the first mission in Skyrim, khajiit claws are rendered nearly obsolete.
    If one wants to cast a spell of water breathing, they must have an alteration
    level of 50 to cast it effectively, and the effect lasts only 60 seconds per cast,
    and cannot be casted underwater or while swimming ([4](<https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Waterbreathing_(Skyrim)>)).
    The only way to gain the enchantment is to find a random helmet with the enchantment,
    or late game loot such as the ebony warrior''s helmet, who does not spawn until
    the player is level 80, which is not nearly as reliable or immediate as simply
    having the racial ability.


    In terms of racial abilities in Skyrim, the argonians have 3 while the khajiit
    have only 2. The khajiit are limited to 60 seconds of night vision once per day,
    and the passive existence of their claws ([5](<https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Khajiit_(Skyrim)>)).
    The argonians however have access to rapid healing once per day, a passive 50%
    resistance to all diseases, and a passive ability to breathe underwater ([6](<https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Argonians_(Skyrim)>)).


    In conclusion, argonians are better warriors according to the lore, and are an
    innately more advantageous race to play in Skyrim.

    Very interesting argument! I cannot argue the outcome of the Oblivion Crisis,
    however I think that the only reason the Argonians were as powerful as they were
    was because of The Hist, their prophecy tree. I believe that it was luck the Argonians
    found the Hist, because otherwise it would have been up to whoever was in control
    of the Hist. Say, as an example, the Redguards found the Hist. They would not
    have been overrun. Say, Khajiit. Same scenario.


    Also funny thing I noticed while writing, every race in Skyrim is marked as "incorrect
    spelling," so that''s funny. Anyway, I''ll resume.

    You said that Khajiit claws are nearly obsolete. This is untrue. Khajiit claws
    deal more damage when using fists, so you will most likely win _any_ bar brawl
    against a non-khajiit. This attribute is most useful when weapons such as "Gloves
    of the Pugilist" are used. The benefits of both the gloves and the claws combine,
    giving you a very powerful weapon to last a while in the game. Admittedly, it
    wont last as long as many would like, but it does last.


    A trait you failed to mention among Khajiit is stealth. Socially among Tamriel,
    this is used against them. However, aside from what others think Khajiit will
    do, Khajiit are the stealthiest among all races/classes. Khajiit make amazing
    Assassins, theives, spies and guards. No other race matches their stealth without
    enchantments and potions.


    > Secondly, argonians can breathe underwater.


    Argonians have a water breathing ability, that''s true. The way you glorify the
    ability makes it seem as though it is one of the most useful abilities in the
    game. There are so few quests that involve swimming that most players do not need
    water-breathing, even in potion form. Even when swimming and water breathing may
    be necessary, there is so little water that the ability becomes


    > nearly obsolete.


    Anyway, Thanks for taking this argument and thanks for taking it seriously. I
    look forward to your response. Apologies for the late response. Thank you!

    Argonians are superior to khajiit. My opponent asserts that the only reason the
    argonians were the only recorded race to turn the tide against the daedric hordes
    was due to the Hist, and while the Hist did aid in directing the argonian counterattacks,
    it would not have been successful without the ability of individual argonian warriors.
    It was the valor and skill of the fighters that turned the tide, in conjunction
    with their connection to the Hist that allowed Black Marsh to overwhelm the daedra.
    The Hist is an ancient type of tree that grows in Black Marsh, and is venerated
    by the argonian''s culture. The Hist is an integral part of argonian society,
    and the sap is used ritualistically in many parts of the argonians life, but it
    did not do the fighting for them ([1](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Hist#:~:text=The%20Hist%20are%20a%20race,most%20ancient%20race%20on%20Nirn.)).
    However, even if my opponent''s argument was true, it would only strengthen the
    idea that a race closely tied to the Hist, like the argonians, would have the
    advantage over one that isn''t, like the khajiit.


    My argument in regards to the claws was that they are rendered nearly obsolete
    by weapons that can be acquired in the tutorial mission of the game, whereas the
    ability to acquire water breathing as a khajiit takes considerably longer than
    it takes to replace claws as a primary weapon. Plus, bar brawls are quite rare
    in the grand scheme of things, constituting only 17 ([2](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Brawling))
    of the 270+ ([3](https://gamerant.com/skyrim-best-side-quests-where-find/#:~:text=With%20over%20270%20total%20quests,every%20side%20quest%20on%20offer.))quests
    in the game. Additionally, there are over 700 bandits in Skyrim alone ([4](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/f/p/3130764652707842001#:~:text=The%20sum%20of%20every%20%22bandit,with%20a%20grain%20of%20salt.)),
    not to include other types of enemies, of which there are many. So claws are useful
    against 17 enemies in brawls, whereas weapons will be used against over 700 bandits,
    and every other enemy in the game, to much greater effect.


    As for water breathing, there are 16 underwater chests in Skyrim, and 5 underwater
    location entrances ([5](<https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Underwater_Locations_(Skyrim)>)),
    totalling 21 instances of water breathing being practical, and only 17 bar brawl
    quests, meaning that there are more opportunities for using water breathing than
    there are claws. Therefore, water breathing is more useful than claws.


    My opponent dropped the fact that argonians also have more natural abilities than
    khajiit, which are individually more practically useful than the racial abilities
    of the khajiit.


    In conclusion, argonians are better than khajiit. Argonians have more numerous,
    more practical racial abilities, while khajiit have fewer, more immediately obsolete
    racial abilities. Also, argonians are, canonically, more successful warriors.

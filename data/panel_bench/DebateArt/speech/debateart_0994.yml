  content: "To begin, I will enforce that the superhuman registration act, the main\
    \ focus of Captain America: civil war, is an unjust thing done by incorrect members\
    \ of the US government.\n\nThere are three major points to this act.\n\n1.) Superhumans\
    \ are to reveal their identities to the US government and other important branches\
    \ deserving of the knowledge, such as SHIELD and the executive branch.\n\n2.)\
    \ Superhumans are to avoid civilian casualties and not interfere with military\
    \ operations.\n\n3.) Superhumans refusing to sign the act will be considered terrorists\
    \ and a threat to national security.\n\nFirst of all, the US government cannot\
    \ be directly trusted with the knowledge of superhero's identities. Sure, some\
    \ never mask their faces and can be identified on regular security cameras, but\
    \ smaller, poorer others such as spider man deserve anonymity, since they are\
    \ unable to protect themselves if the government leaks their identities.\n\nIt\
    \ is one of the common clich\xE9s of superhero life when a hero's identity is\
    \ revealed and their loved ones immediately are endangered. It is a clich\xE9\
    , however, because it is entirely possible. Look at Iron Man. His alter ego is\
    \ Tony Stark, a famous billionaire with a wife and daughter, a massive, well defended\
    \ complex, and a penthouse suite in the middle of Manhattan. He can be easily\
    \ connected to his suit, as he is very obviously one of the only people with the\
    \ courage and money to make those things possible.\n\nThen, look at Spider Man.\
    \ He is a teenage boy who could hardly protect his stuff from being discovered\
    \ by his aunt. Say, hypothetically, he turned over his identity to the government.\
    \ The president would obviously learn of the SRA, and would want to know the identities\
    \ of the defenders of earth. That same president could **very** easily slip and\
    \ reveal the identity of an unprotected individual.\n\nSuperheroes' protection\
    \ is involved in their anonymity. People's protection (against super villains\
    \ and aliens) relies on superheroes. If a villain got a hero's identity, found\
    \ their loved ones and used them as hostages/bait/leverage, then superheroes would\
    \ slowly disappear or do the villain's bidding. They are heroes, they do great\
    \ things for the world, but they are still very much mortal. Mr. Stark's recent\
    \ passing proves this.\n\nSuperheroes are vigilantes, but that does not mean that\
    \ they are inherently bad. They, like the military, would lay down their lives\
    \ to protect the earth, as well as their own cities and countries. Every single\
    \ civilian casualty that occurred during major events like the 2012 invasion of\
    \ New York was the fault of Thanos and Loki. Damages beyond that were simply free\
    \ movement of the group of people that saved the city, and therefore the earth.\
    \ If you are at war, and you send a tank battalion to defend your city, you can\
    \ expect that some of your tanks will bring down houses. This is because it isn't\
    \ a police operation, it is a war zone. If a military operation is staged to prevent\
    \ casualties, they will be greatly less efficient than the superheroes that volunteered\
    \ to fight for them.\n\nLastly, a quote from Gutenberg.org shows the true unfairness\
    \ of this act.\n\n> It was revealed in _Amazing Spider-Man_ #535 that unregistered\
    \ individuals are sent to a prison in the otherdimensional [Negative Zone](http://self.gutenberg.org/articles/Negative_Zone)\
    \ indefinitely until they agree to register. [Iron Man](http://self.gutenberg.org/articles/Iron_Man)\
    \ claims that as this is off [United States](http://self.gutenberg.org/articles/United_States_of_America)\
    \ soil, they have almost no civil rights unless the [United States Supreme Court](http://self.gutenberg.org/articles/United_States_Supreme_Court)\
    \ explicitly rules otherwise\u2014and he knows they won't. This leads [Spider-Man](http://self.gutenberg.org/articles/Spider-Man)\
    \ to re-evaluate his support of the act.\n\n(Ignore the links in the quote)\\\n\
    How can this be fair in any way? Is there a waiting period of discovering powers\
    \ and becoming a vigilante before registering? To enforce this, they would need\
    \ to have very strong technology that limits superhero's abilities. They would\
    \ also need to have full control in every country in the world, as well as control\
    \ of space and sovereign nations.\n\nLets use our hypothetical superhero for this.\
    \ A young man living as a monk in the Tibetan mountains received a special gift\
    \ by achieving something no other monks could achieve. This special gift was the\
    \ ability to manipulate fire in it's entirety. He can start fires with a thought,\
    \ as well as snuff them out with the same effort. He can change color, heat, and\
    \ spread of the fire. He is still learning about his own powers, and has moved\
    \ down into an even more secluded area to train and practice. In his training,\
    \ he discovered a ancient rouge monk with the same gift intended to destroy all\
    \ life in a two hundred mile radius to provide true seclusion. His battle with\
    \ the rogue monk attracted attention to him, and to avoid revealing his identity\
    \ to the cameras and people that appeared, he masked himself with fire.\n\nThe\
    \ superhuman registration act would logically require that this monk reveal their\
    \ identity to the US government or local authorities. The monk naturally didn't\
    \ want to, as their identity would connect them to their troubled past again,\
    \ as well as endanger the relatively defenseless monks at the temple. This could\
    \ go two ways now.\n\n1.) The monk is sent to the ethereal prison through some\
    \ means, and is forced to register themselves to regain their power. An unforeseen\
    \ secondary villain then appears after this, and with the knowledge of the secret\
    \ monks in the mountains, destroys their temple and the master. This troubles\
    \ the monk so greatly that, separated from indirect military help, attempts to\
    \ take revenge on the villain. Their battle causes a city to be fully destroyed\
    \ and 100,000 civilian casualties to be wreaked.\n\n2.) The monk evades capture\
    \ or stands their ground for long enough for them to not trust the government\
    \ and turn against them. While on the run, the monk turns against the government\
    \ and decides to hurt them rather than help them. The unforeseen villain is then\
    \ free to wreak their own havoc and start a war with the US government that lasts\
    \ a few years before finishing.\n\nIf the SRA never interfered, the monk would've\
    \ trained for longer, forseen the villain, and been prepared to defeat them, fighting\
    \ them in a smaller village and only causing a few hundred casualties.\n\nThis\
    \ is all hypothetical, yet the points stand, and accidental interference from\
    \ the government will hurt the ability of the superheroes.\n"

    \ not a particularly psychopathic girl and words can't describe the love I have\
    \ for my beloved best friend Clinton Barton, better known as Hawkeye or my estranged\

    \ was fighting to be sacrificed in place of me.\n\nI am... Unsure, who \u201C\
    Con\u201D is, is it Peter Parker the Spider-Man I\u2019m dealing with? He was\
    \ on **_our side_** of the Civil War!... He supported having this enacted alongside\
    \ us, and he is debating against the Act? That would be disappointing... Stark\
    \ was very fond of him.\n\nThe idea that Con is pushing forth is that instead\
    \ of trusting elected officials and human intelligence agencies, you\u2019d be\
    \ better off letting the superhumans rule by a \u2018might is right\u2019 mentality\
    \ where they can stay anonymous, unknown and unguarded against. The idea is that\
    \ enough of them will be \u2018good\u2019 and fight off the \u2018evil\u2019 ones.\
    \ This is very similar to the gun rights debate, one I know a lot about as I\u2019\
    m a trained assassin who understand just how responsible one should be with weapons\
    \ and what everyone having one could achieve, both good and bad. If we simply\
    \ let mutants be unmoderated, without restriction and able to hide as they please,\
    \ guess which kind of superhuman will take advantage of this? The evil ones. Sure,\
    \ maybe one or two very introverted superhumans who hate the stigma against them\
    \ or who are embarrassed about their power(s) will dislike it being known who\
    \ they are and what they can do but that\u2019s the price you pay for safety and\
    \ harmony in the world.\n\nI stand here telling you that we are your friends,\
    \ so there\u2019s only two reasons to support Con\u2019s side of the debate:\n\
    \n1. You\u2019re a corrupt superhuman who wants to stay anonymous to enable you\
    \ to ruthlessly harm humanity and get away with it.\n2. You\u2019re a naive privacy\
    \ advocate.\n\nLet\u2019s go a little further with scenario 2. I will explain\
    \ to you why the Avengers Act is both good and necessary. I was a non-superhuman\
    \ member of the team so you can point at me and say \u2018all that would be on\
    \ record is you\u2019re a well trained assassin, it\u2019s easy for you to support\
    \ it\u2019. They wouldn\u2019t be wrong, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t stick to\
    \ only my perspective on this.\n\nAt first, the superhuman beings, Avenger or\
    \ not, would be able to get by quietly and humbly unbothered about their power\
    \ as they can usually hide it well (the obvious ones have no choice but to reveal\
    \ it, which actually supports my side as being fairer on all of them). Slowly,\
    \ the ones with sinister motive are going to abuse \u2018normal humans\u2019 and\
    \ even inferior or countered superhumans as they please, relishing in their power.\
    \ Then, you\u2019re going to be screaming, begging for an Avenger group to form\
    \ and fight them off, protecting you from them and the one thing that would help\
    \ us most; knowing who the superhuman beastly villains are, is the thing you have\
    \ not made exposed to both you and us, meaning we\u2019re left in the dark. We\u2019\
    d be more than happy for you to know who we are and to answer to elected, well-regulated\
    \ officials of the human species. It\u2019s you who want gods and/or demigods\
    \ like Thor and Loki to have you at their whim and not even have a clue or see\
    \ them coming.\n\nAll must answer to someone in a civilised society. I must answer\
    \ to my commander and the one at the \u2018top\u2019 must answer to the people\
    \ as a whole and be someone they want in charge. That is precisely what this act\
    \ would enable. No matter how great our superpower, we are known to you and unable\
    \ to make an irresponsible move that you don\u2019t know how to counter or which\
    \ we\u2019ll not be disciplined for if we do manage to pull it off.\n"

  content: "To begin, my opponent did not address a few key points of my argument\
    \ that deserve addressing.\n\n- What would happen to superheroes that need to\
    \ hide their identity to keep their loved ones safe?\n- Is there a waiting period\
    \ between discovering powers and joining the act, or do you go immediately into\
    \ the negative zone?\n- The entire monk argument, (I would like at least one reason\
    \ why this is an unreasonable argument and not a realistic, important thing.)\n\
    \nMy opponent presented a strongly pathos argument in the last round, and as my\
    \ highschool debate club taught me, that is the most manipulative way of speaking\
    \ for when your argument cannot be supported by logic.\n\nAs I stated in a previous\
    \ argument, my opinion on this act was changed when I discovered of the negative\
    \ zone and the lack of basic human rights presented there. The negative zone is\
    \ a other-dimensional Guantanamo bay. Superhumans, no matter what age, are thrown\
    \ into there until they \"decide\" to register their identities to the government.\n\
    \nThere are many possible problems that arise when facing this act. These problems\
    \ all have one thing in common: the government.\n\n1.) Hydra can easily infiltrate\
    \ our government. Imagine what would happen if Hydra knew the full identity of\
    \ me, or Ant man, or Falcon?\n\n2.) There is a little thing in the government\
    \ called bureaucracy. This is a well known process that always takes way too long\
    \ for anything to get done. Imagine the government decides that superheroes need\
    \ more control beyond the registration act. Imagine if the government puts checks\
    \ and balances on our powers! We are superhuman. While that doesn't make us gods,\
    \ (In most cases) it does mean that we should never give control of our actions\
    \ to any government! Hypothetical time again. Say another big bad comes out and\
    \ tries to, oh I don't know, eat the earth's core. Now, without the registration\
    \ act and further acts, the avengers would run in and risk their lives immediately\
    \ in order to save the earth. But with bureaucracy in the way, we would have to\
    \ wait for our controllers to get the news, their subordinates to get the news,\
    \ at least one executive meeting, and then a dispatch to the bad guy. Bureaucracy\
    \ will hurt superheroes. For an example, look at the invasion of 2012.\n\n3.)\
    \ Testing and training. The government, NASA, other governments, they all want\
    \ to know as much as they possibly can. If we superheroes register ourselves,\
    \ they will be able to contact us whether we want to or not. In time, they will\
    \ want to know, out of sheer curiosity, what the hell we are. They will want to\
    \ see my tech ***Shows off webshooter*** they will want to take blood samples,\
    \ and fitness tests, and MRI's. This has multiple problems on its own.\n\n- If\
    \ superhumans spend our time testing, we will not get: free time, privacy, space,\
    \ home life, etc. We will have to explain to everybody that wants to spend time\
    \ with us that we are busy nearly 24/7, and they will likely guess what we do\
    \ when we \"can't hang out\" (See below argument between bold lines **------------**)\n\
    - The tech we use makes the things we do entirely possible. Wakanda's help made\
    \ it so that the world has access to new, never-before-seen things that will likely\
    \ catapult us towards the new space age. But what about Kree energy cores, Iron\
    \ man's suits, Ant man's nanotech, or my webs? Yes, that tech can be helpful,\
    \ but it can also be very harmful. We don't want a world where battles are carried\
    \ out exclusively between intentional robots, super soldiers, and hulks. Not to\
    \ mention the possible issues arising when people start hooking patented SCOTTY(TM)\
    \ cameras up to flies and spying on their exes, or thousands of other possibilities\
    \ that can arise from the secrets we hold.\n\n______________________________________________________________________\n\
    \n## We can trust the top levels of the government, maybe, but do you think we\
    \ could ever trust our immediate family when they find out what we can do? We\
    \ aren't ALL orphans. Some superhumans will have abusive parents, crafty girlfriends,\
    \ or loudmouth brothers. Imagine getting calls every other day saying that you\
    \ need to skip school AGAIN to go to another testing site. In order to do this,\
    \ the people that would need to know would be: Your guardian, your ride, your\
    \ boss, your coworkers or peers, your SO, your entire moderately extended family,\
    \ and anybody you need to care for. The government can't just pick all of you\
    \ up and force you to in a government facility unless you need to fight a war.\n\
    \n> Slowly, the ones with sinister motive are going to abuse \u2018normal humans\u2019\
    \ and even inferior or countered superhumans as they please, relishing in their\
    \ power.\n\nAnd you don't think that somebody on the fence can be pushed into\
    \ a supervillain role because of the basic want for privacy being violated by\
    \ the government? If that happens, and the superhuman is powerful, don't you think\
    \ that some avengers will need to come stop them? I don't want to spend half my\
    \ time chasing down scared, na\xEFve young adults and teens with powers just to\
    \ solve problems the government created.\n\nThink of it like the comic book superhero,\
    \ batman. He cooperates with one person, commissioner Gordon. Every time Gordon\

    anti-sportsmanlike behaviour of con to not be roleplaying at all. The description
    clearly made out that this would be a debate between two characters from Marvel,
    I figured he''d be Captain America or Hawkeye. This is just a deplorable effort
    where the very things I did to really make it a convincing act as Black Widow
    ended up being things he claimed were bad debating strategy. I am roleplaying
    a convincing heartfelt speech, of course some of it will be emotional.


    \--


    **_In character from here on out._**


    \--


    Con seems to be presenting to you a case of heartfelt emotion while accusing me
    of the very same, saying that his high-school debating coach told him that''s
    used by the side that''s lying. See, the entire case of Con boils down to the
    following erroneous angles:


    1. That superhumans are more entitled to secrecy and privacy than the non-superpowered
    and non-vigilante-trained humans are entitled to protection from them.

    2. That superhumans should anonymously rule by ''might is right'' and that this
    is more trustworthy than elected government officials from the non-superhuman
    human species to keep the world safeguarded.

    3. That those that want to know superhumans are going to be more sinister than
    benevolent in motive.


    All three are baseless...


    Who is Batman? I don''t know him... Is he from another universe maybe? I am from
    Marvel universe, or so I''ve been told in the afterlife.


    The government should know of the superhuman threats and either tame us or indeed
    put us down. Just because we feel entitled to privacy doesn''t mean you''re not
    entitled to protection. You elected a government and they keep you safeguarded.
    Sure, it''s remotely possible that suddenly a group of really evil and sinister
    people run the Avengers scheme and recruit to turn us evil etc, yeah this is indeed
    remotely possible. If the world is so corrupt or unlucky that the very elected
    government and agencies attached to them are wanting to harm the human species
    as a whole, that''s kind of a doomed scenario no matter what...


    A guy like Bruce Banner is a fantastic individual when he''s calm but once he''s
    in Hulk mode, if the government and its army lacked data on how to calm him down
    it could end bad _**both for him and others (because they''d stop at nothing to
    kill him or permanently trap him).**_


    _**It''s bad for the superhumans**_ to remain anonymous and suddenly break out
    or attack. The world and the agencies running/protecting it need to know the difference
    between a Hulk attack and a Loki attack (the latter being one with malicious intent).
    They also need to study them and understand how to help protect even the superhumans
    themselves from others by explaining it to others. Knowledge of who is which kind
    of superhuman and how to tame/handle them is very essential to keep both superhumans
    safe from human authorities and humans safe from superhumans. It is win-win.

    Sorry, I didn''t fully intend for this to be a debate between the two superheroes,
    by roleplay I meant the lawyers representing their causes on the legal ends. The
    testifying should have meant that the superheroes we represent get a say in things
    too. I decided to attempt to "Yes-and" what my opponent was saying because I just
    wanted to avoid confrontation. By the "Yes-and" in the rules, I meant that this
    is a fictional universe and therefore we would "Yes-and" the hypothetical/real
    in the universe examples.


    That obviously didn''t go as intended, but I jumped in this shit creek so I might
    as well do some laps.


    \[In character\]


    To begin, Batman is a comic book superhero. I read about him in Stan Lee''s comic
    shop in harlem.


    I want to begin by applauding my opponent and saying that the Hulk-or-Loki attack
    is a VERY valid point. I want to present a counterargument and a compromise, saying
    that superheroes that believe in the government''s ability to keep secrets or
    help them could register if they want, and rely on the government to protect them.
    However, this is not a universal situation, and you cannot generalize the anomalies
    that we are.


    > Con seems to be presenting to you a case of heartfelt emotion while accusing
    me of the very same, saying that his high-school debating coach told him that''s
    used by the side that''s lying


    1.) I did not say that your side was lying, I said that it was a side that cannot
    be supported by logic.


    > that is the most manipulative way of speaking for when your argument cannot
    be supported by logic.


    These are not the same things, as Pathos makes up for what Logos cannot attain.
    I did say it was manipulative, because it is.


    2.) What part of "A kid in highschool can''t defend himself without some anonymity"
    is heartfelt emotion? Haven''t you heard of the internet?\

    Even now, on the internet, I protect my identify with Usernames, VPNs, and passwords.
    A superhero would be a celebrity if public. Celebrities protect their identities
    too. Look at Alan Walker, Marshmello, or any other masked music artists.


    Superheroes are humans too. We deserve privacy and rights equal to humans, even
    if we have unnatural abilities. Say, a superhero wanted to use their power in
    a neutral way, and simply use it to preform on stage. Would it really be logical
    for the government to force them to register their powers and roll the dice on
    creating a vagabond, criminal, or villain?


    Many mistakes made by the government and military are covered simply because the
    people they wronged are powerless. If you accidentally wrong a superhero, (Which
    could certainly happen during an attempted capture) you can easily make an enemy.


    Not all superheroes have a belief in doing good and only good. When I was working
    to take down kingpin, the Green Goblin set out a police force hell-bent on killing
    exclusively me. I became an enemy to the people thanks to Oswald and JJJ. Yet,
    I wanted good. I wanted to stay on my path and clean up the mess I left when kingpin
    finally went down. I could''ve gone for the secret police, I could''ve forsaken
    the government and joined AIM or Hydra. Yet, I didn''t.


    Not all Superhumans have the same values as me. To my opponent: you are a Russian
    agent working for SHIELD, correct? That means you have already forsaken one government
    in favor of another, is it so far to reach that a nuclear superhero could forsake
    ours?


    There are 137 countries in the world, an they all want to have the upper hand
    at all times. Superheroes in the unwilling possession of any government will be
    a danger to mankind greater than the prospect of nuclear war.


    The avengers deserve to be a sovereign group. They have geniuses in charge, strict
    rules for noobs, and moral codes. We have done nothing but lay down our lives
    for the city, world, and universe we live in.


    In the words of star-lord, we want to save the universe because we''re the freaking
    idiots who live in it.


    And if you finally decide that this movement deserves to be passed, I just want
    to simply say:


    Have fun trying to control Captain Marvel.

    There is this notion that in a world of revealed superpowers only the corrupt
    will stay hidden and very hidden indeed, much like gun rights as I alluded to
    in my first Round. The problem with this defeatist attitude is that is presumes
    you would never be able to truly have a loyal, benevolent group of superhumans
    serving humanity as a whole. After all, it would take only one or two very efficient
    psychic-powered people to be for your side to help expose very many hiding superhumans.
    The thing is you assume inability, inefficiency and all this but it would of course
    be done. The reason it is fairly obvious how efficient that it would be done is
    that you''re most afraid of just how powerfully it would be done. I notice that
    the case made by you, mysterious lawyer, is that you come from a stance of ''everyone
    is out to get everyone but we should assume that anonymous supervillains won''t
    outsmart and outfight anonymous superheroes''. This is hilarious, I hope you understand
    that I''ve proven this concept thoroughly self-defeating throughout. You need
    to expose all superhumans and well-trained non superhumans that are either going
    to be a force protecting the world or... Eliminated. Indeed, there would be war
    involved. You need to eliminate threats at times but it''s very important no resources
    are wasted and no superpowered heroes on a Hulk-like rampage are taken as ''threats''
    of any long-term kind and instead correctly calmed down and made to love humans,

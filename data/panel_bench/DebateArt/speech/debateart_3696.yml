    **1. Hearsay**\

    Merriam-Webster for "[Hearsay](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hearsay)":
    Rumor


    - "[Rumor](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rumor)": talk or opinion
    widely disseminated with no discernible source


    "[Founded](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/founded)": to take the first
    steps in building


    I would argue that the foundation of the idea of "God" was early enough that it
    was not disseminated. The first step(s) involves people analyzing phenomena(leading
    to people later concluding that it was, in fact, God) and later actually concluding
    there to be a God, as well as assigning attribute to what "god" they think is,
    such as omnipotence, etc. When the idea of God is created with enough coherence
    and clarity that could be understood by people simply, it is being founded. In
    other words, the idea of God should have been founded before it could be disseminated,
    thus not by rumor.


    If an idea that could bear resemblance to what "god" is but is not coherent or
    complete enough to be called an actual distinct "idea", then is that idea "god"?
    Although I am not an arcaeologist nor a historian, if the idea of "some supreme
    creator, not necessarily God" that is not enough coherent is spreaded among the
    populace and then became what we know as "God", then that means the predecessor
    idea of "God" is being founded by hearsay, not "God" itself.


    Either the idea of "God" developed independently to be coherent, in that case,
    not founded by hearsay; or said idea is polished after widespread of the proto-idea
    not yet complete, in which the idea itself is founded after hearsay. What makes
    it different is by the hearsay of the latter scenario, it is not "God" that is
    the idea that is founded. After the foundation for the latter scenario, further
    dissemination is still not foundation as the idea is already coherent enough to
    say it is being founded.


    Therefore, the idea of "God" simply cannot be founded in any part by hearsay.
    Also, hearsay is not an essential component in the building of the idea of "God",
    or any idea at all, since "God" is not an idea that necessarily depend on population
    believing in it. While people could believe in God and further detail his abilities,
    the definition of "God" is not depended on that people believing in it.


    **2. Fictional Character**


    - [MW Definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/character): one of
    the persons of a drama or novel


    Is God a "person"? I think not. Maybe we apply the word "character" way too liberally
    so that a talking desk and a sentient chair qualify as "characters", by definition,
    God is not. More than that, I would argue that neither the Bible nor the Quran
    nor any holy text in any holy religion is actually either a drama or a novel.
    **This is the closest thing I can get in the definition page. I demand Pro prove
    that the Bible or Quran(etc.) are drama or novel, or this point is dropped.**
    And no, God is obviously NOT an attribute.


    > Yet Christians everywhere will affirm that **God** is a **person**, while the
    average Muslim will readily deny this.


    Some religions straight-up deny that God is a person, rendering all definitions
    that apply to any sentient creatures(as opposed to other things like attributes)
    to be unapplicable. Without restrictions stated, Pro ought to prove that God is
    a fictional character, a person, in all cases, and in all religions.


    **3. Rebuttal**


    > And said accounts are not in agreement Eiether the [New testaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Testament)
    and [old testaments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Testament) are a prime
    example of these conflicting accounts.


    Pro thinks that the idea of "God" was never coherent, meaning that the idea was
    never even founded in the first place. That proves the topic wrong.


    > So not only is there NO solid evidence, the only form of evidence that can be
    produced is hearsay accounts that can''t be validated and are themselves controversial
    in nature.


    If it were founded, then dissemination must occur after the idea was created,
    or that it was not hearsay of God itself, or in other words hearsay was never
    a part in the foundation of the idea of God.


    **4. Conclusions**


    - Hearsay cannot be a part of the foundation of the idea of "God".

    - God is not a "fictional character".

    - Pro thinks that the idea of "God" may have never been found in the first place,
    in the end proving the topic wrong instead of right.

    - Overall, vote CON!

    the Con is claiming that God is really simply because we have a foundation understanding
    on what god is in theory and that analyzing phenomena will conclude that God is
    real. This can be rebutted for two reasons.


    1. just because people have foundation of what they think to be a god does not
    make said God real, it only establishes the theory of who God is.

    2. There is id nothing in phenomena to objectively say there is a god regardless
    of people who may claim that leads them to believe it does.

    of God should have been founded before it could be disseminated, thus not by rumor."


    The con is arguing from an appeal to the majority stance, this does not prove
    God at all because understanding the concept of something will not make said concept
    true. By that logic superman would be real because enough people understand the
    idea of him enough to not make him fictional. so yes ot remins a rumor and thus
    hearsay until Proven otherwise.

    . The cons argument lacks logic, if something cannot be empirically proven and
    is based only on the accounts of people or in the Cons case "idea" is by definition
    a rumor and otherwise known as hearsay. an "idea" alone does not validate an existence.


    > "Either the idea of "God" developed independently to be coherent, in that case,
    not founded by hearsay; "


    ideas be it coherent or not is still hearsay because it lacks empirical foundation
    and is based on nothing more than rumors. I''m not sure why the Con seems to believe
    that just because a thought or opinion is coherent that it somehow does not fall
    under the definition of hearsay but it''s clear that this is what it is.


    > "or said idea is polished after widespread of the proto idea not yet complete,
    in which the idea itself is founded after hearsay. What makes it different is
    by the hearsay of the latter scenario, it is not "God" that is the idea that is

    Coherence has no factor on if something is hearsay based or not.

    the Con seems to be arguing about the idea of God being hearsay rather than the
    god in question. the debate is not about the "idea" of God. it''s about God being
    fiction and based on hearsay. Therefore, the argument is irrelevant and completely
    off base.

    And no, God is obviously NOT an attribute.


    1. God is a character in the bible. anything be it human, demon warlock you name
    it. Anything in a book that is given a name, individuality or credit actions in
    any book fictional or otherwise is a character. Therefore, God is a character
    by definition and to deny that is uneducated.

    2. Neither the bible nor any "Holy text" can be validated or proven true. Therefore,
    everything in it is only true if you believe which makes it subjective and thus
    can be described as fictional book

    3. They don''t have to be specifically a drama or novel you only need to deny
    or question its validity and thus can call it a fictional book and subsequently
    every character in it would be a work of fiction including god


    > "Some religions straight-up deny that God is a person, rendering all definitions

    If a religion claims God is real, then the burden of proof is on them. Secondly
    the purpose of calling god a fictional person is to deny gods existence so wither
    that god is viewed as a human, creature or otherwise is irrelevant so that argument
    is irrelevant as well,


    > "Pro thinks that the idea of "God" was never coherent, meaning that the idea
    was never even founded in the first place. That proves the topic wrong."


    Con thinks that a coherent idea of God undermines the concept of hearsay, and
    it does not. hearsay applies in all situations where the proof is nonexistent
    empirically and only exists in rumor thus ideas being coherent or incoherent is
    still hearsay without proper evidence.


    "If it were founded, then dissemination must occur after the idea was created,
    or that it was not hearsay of God itself, or in other words hearsay was never
    a part in the foundation of the idea of God."


    hearsay does not require to be part of a foundation of the idea god. you must
    simply fail to prove exists outside of the idea for hearsay to applie


    > - Hearsay cannot be a part of the foundation of the idea of "God".


    Hearsay applies in all situations where your foundation of evidence lacks empirical
    prove.


    > - God is not a "fictional character"


    Con has not established this, only that some religions dont view god as a person
    which is irrlevent


    > - Pro thinks that the idea of "God" may have never been found in the first place,
    in the end proving the topic wrong instead of right.


    Never claimed the "idea" of god was never found. only that its based on fictional
    characterizations as well as superstitious hersay.


    > - Overall Vote CON!


    thats not a conclusion thats a statement.


    Overall Cons argument is that God is not a fictional character simply because
    they assume hearsay requires an idea to be cohernt and that god is not a fictional
    character because they belive god isnt a person and there for cant be called as
    such. both arguments are false because anything mentioned or trated as an indidvual
    in a book is a character and since we cant vaildate the bible to be true its fair
    to call it fictional and thus gods a fictional character as result. And hearsay
    as ive said before applies anywhere evidnced for something lacks anything factaul
    and is based on a rumor which a thought, idea, or opinion alll fall under that
    category cohernt or not.

    real. This can be rebutted for two reasons.


    I did not conclude that God is "real" materially, but yes, it is "real" as an
    idea. The idea of Superman or Luke Skywalker is known to enough people so that
    the character of the "idea" of such a person is fleshed out that they are coherent
    ideas. Superman is real as an idea and not materially. So is God as an idea, and
    what I am trying to prove that dissemination or hearsay take place either before
    or after the idea of God is founded, while not taking part in the foundation of
    the idea itself. If God is "not real", then Pro would fulfill not his BoP due
    to that nothing can be founded if it does not exist. if Pro is really saying this,
    that means a concession.


    Keep in mind, that Pro did not use any adjectives when describing what "exist"
    he is talking about in the description or in the rounds, so the scope of what
    can be referred to as "existent" would be indefinite. In this case, God obviously
    exists, as an idea, and its foundation is not built in any part on hearsay.


    > The con is arguing from an appeal to the majority stance, this does not prove
    God at all because understanding the concept of something will not make said concept
    true. By that logic superman would be real because enough people understand the
    idea of him enough to not make him fictional. so yes ot remins a rumor and thus
    hearsay until Proven otherwise.


    No, by that logic it means that the idea of Superman is founded, and to use Superman
    as an example, the idea of what Superman is was founded solely by DC comics before
    it is disclosed to the public, meaning that Superman already exists as an idea
    before the hearsay stage.


    For God, it is the same thing. One first thinks out loud what God is and what
    God can do, fully determining a set of abilities included by God before spreading
    the word about God to the people by hearsay. If what God is was still unknown
    right as they spread any word to anybody around, then what they have disseminated
    was not the idea of God, as the idea has not yet founded.


    > . The cons argument lacks logic, if something cannot be empirically proven and
    is based only on the accounts of people or in the Cons case "idea" is by definition
    a rumor and otherwise known as hearsay. an "idea" alone does not validate an existence.


    Except, God is an idea, just like Superman or going more abstract, for example,
    nihilism. You cannot visualize what nihilism is, can you? You can''t bring nihilism
    into the real world, can you? Despite that, Nihilism persists to exist as an idea,
    as a set of facts/statements.


    Superman can also be described as a set of facts/statements, for example:


    - Kryptonite affects Superman.

    - Superman wears a blue-red suit with a cape.

    - Superman posesses superhuman strength.

    - etc.


    In other words, Superman is as existent as an idea as nihilism as an idea. Superman,
    unlike nihilism, includes the entirety of statements or presets that when pieced
    together creates what is similar to an organism, a person, a "character". In fact,
    all characters in fiction are ideas, that can be described by a collection of
    statements. That is what God is, a character-esque idea.


    And yes, an idea exists when a set of statements are put together. For example,
    I can just create idea X:


    - idea X is red.

    - idea X can move at a constant speed of 114514m/h in a straight line.

    - idea X is somewhat resistant to ammunition from pistols.


    And there we go, idea X exists and we know what idea X is: Something red, that
    moves fast, and that is durable. Obviously, we can say that idea X can refer to
    a battalion chief fire truck, but idea X is not exactly a fire truck, as I have
    yet to say that whether idea X has any wheels or is drivable by humans or not.
    That is what happens before the complete foundation of God as an idea: Another
    idea was disseminated but that idea was not exactly God, the same way that I am
    not really telling people that there is a fire truck waiting outside when I tell
    them "idea X" is outside.


    I am not going to specify what set of statements make up what God is as an idea,
    those are in the Bible, or other holy texts like Quran. But yes, God is an idea
    and by thinking it through what "God" really is and assigning attributes and characteristics
    to "God" so it is distinguishable from any other idea, the idea of God exists.
    By Pro''s definition, of course it does.


    If Nihilism exists or Christianity exists(Christianity is also an abstract idea,
    and no, it is not any given cross, church, bishop or artifact), God exists, as
    an idea.


    > 1. God is a character in the bible. anything be it human, demon warlock you
    name it. Anything in a book that is given a name, individuality or credit actions
    in any book fictional or otherwise is a character. Therefore, God is a character
    by definition and to deny that is uneducated.


    First, God is not a character in "The Bible" as God also appears in, for example,
    Judaism and Islam, and according to Islam, God is not considered a person nor
    an attribute. Therefore, in consideration of all considerations of what God is,
    God is not necessarily a person, and not absolutely a character.


    Pro''s definition of what "character" is is unsourced and Pro did not verify himself
    to be more authentic than dictionaries. Point dismissed.


    > 1. They don''t have to be specifically a drama or novel you only need to deny
    or question its validity and thus can call it a fictional book and subsequently
    every character in it would be a work of fiction including god


    Failure to source definitions, and failure of proof for that the Bible(or any
    holy text) is indeed a novel(series?) or drama. Point dropped.


    > Con thinks that a coherent idea of God undermines the concept of hearsay, and
    it does not. hearsay applies in all situations where the proof is nonexistent
    empirically and only exists in rumor thus ideas being coherent or incoherent is
    still hearsay without proper evidence.


    Once again, what I am trying to say is that hearsay either appears before the
    idea of God is fleshed out enough to be its own idea or after, and neither counts.
    Dissemination only spreads one idea, and does not build upon it. The physical
    nonexistence of God does not undermine God existing as an idea as the abstractness
    of nihilism(and thus the inability of bringing it into material) does not render
    it nonexistent.


    > > - God is not a "fictional character"

    >

    > Con has not established this, only that some religions dont view god as a person
    which is irrlevent


    Pro has proven not any holy text satisfies the definition of "fiction".


    **Conclusion**


    - Pro has not established what kind of "existence" he meant, so existence as an
    idea obviously should count.

    - God, like Superman or nihilism or idea X, can be assigned statements, facts,
    attributes, aspects, etc. so that a collected set can be brought together to make
    up an idea. Superman''s set makes him an above-average heroic person, and God''s
    set makes God... yeah, something. As long as a collection of statements exists
    and can be referenced by "term X", for example, then "term X" exists as an idea
    as it refers to an existing collection of statements that makes up an idea, making
    its existence.


    * Therefore, God exists as an idea.

    * Dissemination only spreads one idea, and does not build upon it. Occurance before
    the finish of the foundation of "God" makes the hearsay an idea that isn''t "God"
    and occurance after the foundation makes it not a step in the foundation at all.

    * Therefore, God exists as an idea, and its foundation was not built on hearsay
    at all as it is impossible.


    - Pro has not proven that God is a person in all cases(making in definition that
    God is not actually a character).

    - Pro has not proven that the Bible or any holy text ever satisfy the classification
    of fiction(making in definition that God actually does not appear in fiction).

    - Pro''s case is dismantled by Con. Vote Con!

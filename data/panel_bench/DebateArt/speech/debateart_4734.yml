    **Freedom**\

    The American Revolution produced an internal peace.\[[1](<https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)>)\]
    while the French Revolution produced the Reign of Terror, where many French where
    guillotined.\[[2](https://www.britannica.com/event/Reign-of-Terror)\] The post-Revolutionary
    French government murdered over 800 Catholic priests.\[[3](https://aleteia.org/2020/08/30/there-are-more-christian-martyrs-now-than-in-all-the-previous-centuries/)\]
    The post-Revolutionary American government granted Catholics religious freedom.\[[4](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/)\]
    Note that the percentage of Catholic in the U.S. was much lower than in France.\[[5](https://cushwa.nd.edu/news/the-french-revolution-and-american-catholicism-five-questions-with-mitchell-oxford/)\]\

    **Democracy**\

    The post-Revolutionary French government devolved into an Empire lead by Napoleon
    that invaded many contrives.\[[5](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Napoleon-I/Military-campaigns-and-uneasy-peace#ref16219)\]
    The U.S. was relatively isolationist and realist.\[[6](https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/neutrality-proclamation/)\]\[[7](https://www.thoughtco.com/the-evolution-of-american-isolationism-4123832)\]
    See the foreign policy of President John Quincy Adams for reference.\

    **Human Rights**\

    The American revolutionaries claimed to be restoring their rights as Englishmen.\[[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_Englishmen)\]

  content: 'It is possible that the American and French notions of freedom, democracy,
    and human rights were different. However, if both revolutions were fueled by the
    aspiration for these three things, then my position is correct. They shared an
    aspiration for the same general ideals, but I am not here to argue that they were
    exactly the same in both cases. Which version is better is a matter of opinion
    and is also off-topic. As is federalism.


    My opponent has made some incorrect or irrelevant claims so far. He said that
    the French revolutionaries claimed to be instituting new rights. On the contrary,
    they believed human rights to be natural and imprescriptible, as my third quote
    last round demonstrates. He also points to post-revolution events like the John
    Quincy Adams administration to make his point. That was a full 40 years after
    the American Revolution ended. Con has said little about the aspirations of the
    revolutionaries despite them being the subject of the debate.

    The radically different outcomes of the two revolutions suggests that motives
    of the French and American were different.

    Con has suggested that both the Americans and French aspired for the same ideals
    despite defining these ideals differently. If by "democracy," the Americans meant
    "a system of checks and balances with multiple branches along with protections
    for the minority" and the French meant "50% plus one of the people can do whatever
    they want", then the Americans and French were not aspiring for the same ideal
    of democracy. The same can be said for the other ideals.


    I can claim that all humans have always had the natural right to drink alcohol.
    That does not mean the right has always been protected. The same can be said about
    new rights of the French.


    Thank you for reading.

  content: 'There were countless other factors at play besides motive which made the
    American and French Revolutions different in outcome. If we had more space, perhaps
    we could have gone over those. But as it stands, I have shown that the FR''s leaders
    aspired to freedom, democracy, and human rights, and Con has done nothing to disprove
    this.


    Both occurred because the rights and freedoms of normal people were being trampled
    by monarchs, and the leaders of both were [inspired by Enlightenment thinkers](https://revolution.chnm.org/exhibits/show/liberty--equality--fraternity/enlightenment-and-human-rights)
    like Locke and Montesqieu. The French also strove for a separation of powers,
    as their [Declaration](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/rightsof.asp#:~:text=16.,has%20no%20constitution%20at%20all.)
    says.


    Different cultures may have different notions of democracy. Democracy looks very
    different in the US, Portugal, Finland, and Australia. This does not mean one
    of them is "real" democracy and the rest aren''t. If America and France both desired
    the 3 ideals listed above, Con''s pointing out of the differences between them
    is irrelevant. We agree the former did; I have shown the latter did too.

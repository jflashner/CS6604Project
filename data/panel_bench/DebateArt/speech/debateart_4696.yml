  content: '**Stormzy was just scaring Chip. It was a fake threat.**


    **Chip and his wife were in a really bad place and after she cheated on him with
    Stormzy, she decided to stay at Stormzy''s house. Chip wouldn''t stop calling
    her and Stormzy assumed they were about to get back together, so he took things
    out of context and went to Chip to tell him to back off.**


    **He realized he was in the wrong, so he apologized. But their professional beef
    continued while they resolved things personally, so this is Stormzy''s diss on
    Chip.**

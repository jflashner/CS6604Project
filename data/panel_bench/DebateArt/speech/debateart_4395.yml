  content: 'Increased automation and use of robots could have unintended consequences.
    For example, you get a very different feeling of speaking to a robot. A patient
    may become reassured by the human touch of speaking to a nurse who smiles and
    emphasises with them. A robot could be very depressing because it feels informal,
    non-human. For some services like health care, education, the personal touch is
    an important, unquantifiable aspect of the service. If we push for more automation,
    we may lose out on valuable personal interactions and our quality of life may
    be diminished - huge impact on social life.

  content: 'I agree with you in that regard, however, going back to the actual statement,
    I''d argue that robots are going to increase the quality of life many other ways.
    Let me use an example, think about all the construction workers that allegedly
    died during the construction of the several football stadiums made for the world
    cup held in Qatar last year. All those deaths could''ve been avoided if we simply
    had robots carry out these difficult jobs. Sure, just like with any other invention,
    there will inevitably be good and bad consequences. In this case, I believe the
    good outweighs the bad and it''s not even close.

    But have you ever thought of the increasing temperatures causing global warming?
    People often buy robots to do household chores for them disregarding the fact
    of exercise - but a robot leads a mass in pollution. They could also enhance unsustainable
    exploitation of natural resources, especially if our dependency on rare metals
    for production of electronic equipment further deepens. Proliferation of all sorts
    of electronic equipment and future composite materials also bring new challenges
    for recycling and waste management.

    problem. As technology advances, I''m certain that we humans will find a way to
    minimise this pollution, just like how we''ve seen in the past with electric cars
    emitting less greenhouse gases then engine cars. Regarding your point on "exploitation
    of natural resources" and usage of "rare metals", just like with pollution we
    will surely find a way to optimise recycling and invent new "waste management"
    technologies which can be further utilized to save so much more resources other
    than just metal used for robots/electronics.

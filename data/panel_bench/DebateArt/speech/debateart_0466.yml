  content: 'I''ll simply publish an argument because the current rules of the debate
    doesn''t state that my opponent goes first.


    I''ll lay some basic points here:


    1: The US military defends economic freedom/capitalism internationally. Just ask
    South Korea and Japan. Without the US military defending them, they would be invaded
    by North Korea(NK) and China. From this, tens of millions of innocent civilians
    would lose their lives from the invasion from major cities and other areas getting
    nuked by China and NK. The US military saves more lives then it takes, contrary
    to popular belief.


    2: There are many other nations in the world ruled by tyrannical governments.
    2 examples of this are Cuba and Iran([1](https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/article197537214.html)).
    These governments oppress their people and human rights in these nations are low.
    A US government using military intervention would not only benefit the locals
    by liberating them from their governments, but it would also benefit the US economically
    by allowing more trading partners in the world so we can get more resources. For
    example, if Iran got liberated, now we can trade for oil.


    3: Politicians that are both left and right of center support a strong military.


    Hillary Clinton on the military: Under the Military and Defense label, she wants
    the US to maintain the best trained and best equipped military the world has ever
    seen.\

    [2](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/)


    Donald Trump on the military:


    Mr. Trump has, "worked with Congress to increase defense spending, reverse the
    defense sequester, expand our military capacity, and modernize its capabilities."\

    [3](https://www.promiseskept.com/achievement/overview/national-security-and-defense/#)


    4: The US military creates technology that the world enjoys after the war.


    Military spending goes towards technology that was used for the war. This includes
    things like the internet([4](https://www.reference.com/history/internet-first-invented-a296f3faf635601d?qo=contentSimilarQuestions)).
    Of course, this form of internet was primitive, but it laid the foundation for
    the internet that we know today. If it wasn''t for the military, we would have
    no internet and this debate would not be possible. More military spending means
    more technological progress as history has confirmed.


    More military spending means more positive things in general would come. This
    includes more freedom for oppressed people, more lives saved, has some common
    ground between 2 politicians that generally hate each other and creates technology
    that in the future would be used for other human uses as history has confirmed.

    \ budget funds useless projects. Consider\nour military bases and associated infrastructure.\
    \ The DoD\u2019s own report illustrates\nthe issue at hand. The report estimates\
    \ that the US military is currently operating\nwith 22% excess base-capacity that\
    \ serve no strategic purpose (1). These bases\nare not posturing America to be\
    \ a militaristic superpower, and they are not needed.\nYet, when we increase the\
    \ budget, more money will flow to these strategically\ndefunct bases. Moreover,\
    \ the currently gridlocked congress is unlikely to\ndecrease military bases as\
    \ well. Recently,\n\n\u201CThe House on Thursday voted down a defense policy bill\n\
    provision that would have taken out language preventing a new round of base\n\
    closures... (2)\u201D\\\nAdditionally, military spending on a bloated workforce\
    \ has\ncreated a black hole that will evaporate the military budget. Administrative\n\
    costs, and the cost of hiring too many will hamper our budgetary efficiency. Todd\n\
    Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimates that\n\
    by 2024, both categories of spending will \u201Cconsume the entire defense budget\
    \ by\n2024\\. You\u2019d have no money left for procurement, for research and\
    \ development,\nmilitary construction, for family housing, nothing (3).\u201D\n\
    \nAlso, the cost of having people on the DoD payroll has\nincreased. This is in\
    \ part because the civilian workforce of the DoD equals the\nnumber of troops\
    \ we currently have (which is in the ballpark of 1.3 million\npeople) (4).\\\n\
    Also, cost overruns for military tech is a problem as well.\nThe CATO Institute\
    \ in September of 2015 summarizes a tiny sample of military-cost\noverruns that\
    \ have occurred in constant 2015 dollars:\n\nLittoral Combat Ship\n\nEstimated\
    \ Price: $360 million (2004)\\\nActual Price: $667 million (2014)\n\nEvolved Expendable\
    \ Launch Vehicle\n\nEstimated Price: $102 million (1992)\\\nActual Price: $376\
    \ million (2013)\n\nJoint Strike Fighter\n\nEstimated Price: $79 million (2001)\\\
    \nActual Price: $138 million (2013) (5).\n\nThis is not to suggest that the US\
    \ DoD needs to downsize,\nbut this does illustrate the problems with if an increase\
    \ in the military\nbudget will necessarily mean that the US is any more protected.\
    \ Instead, American\ntaxpayer dollars are wasted, preventing the government from\
    \ fulfilling its\nobligation to the people by giving them a safe, secure nation.\n\
    \n**C2: Dream of Californication...-\nI mean Radicalization**\n\nEven if you do\
    \ not buy the previous analysis, a negation\nballot is preferable because of how\
    \ military funding is used\ncounter-productively. Bradley Bowman of the Council\
    \ of Foreign Relations explains\nhow current US influence in the middle east has\
    \ led to more terror. Remember\nthe strategically useless military bases? As it\
    \ turns out, even some of the\nuseful bases in the middle east have led to increases\
    \ in anti-American\nsentiment. The controversial \u201CAbu Gharib\u201D incident,\
    \ in which American soldiers and\nthe CIA at the titular detention center abused\
    \ inmates. Unauthorized and\negregious torture was used to reap information. This\
    \ abuse went unnoticed for 2\nyears, according to Human Rights Watch (6). Incidents\
    \ such as these tend to\nmake people in countries that we are occupying resent\
    \ us, and feel forced to\nact to defend their perceived territorial rights. Robert\
    \ Pape of the University\nof Chicago writes for the Columbia Law Review, explaining\
    \ that:\\\n\u201CFrom Lebanon to Israel to Sri Lanka to Kashmir to Chechnya,\n\
    every suicide terrorist campaign from 1980 to 2001 has been waged by terrorist\n\
    groups whose main goal has been to establish or maintain self-determination for\n\
    their community\u2019s homeland...\u201D (7).\\\nPape, in his University newspaper\
    \ also mentioned that \u201C95\npercent of all suicide attacks since 1980 have\
    \ had in common is not religion\nbut a specific strategic objective: to compel\
    \ a democratic state to withdraw\ncombat forces from territory the terrorists\
    \ consider their homeland or prize\ngreatly...\u201D (8).\\\nMore recent evidence\
    \ from an FBI report that looked at over\n200 cases of homegrown terrorism and\
    \ found that 18% of these attacks were at\nleast partly caused by anger over US\
    \ military intervention, with 10 out of 16\nsuccessful or attempted attacks in\
    \ the US targeting military personnel or\nfacilities. Not only is there now danger\
    \ abroad, but also significant unease\nback home as well (9).\n\nIf the US is\
    \ going to spend more money on the military, then\nwe need to ask ourselves where\
    \ the funds are going. Even if an iota of the\nmoney is spent on increased military\
    \ intervention, (which is likely given the\n33% rise in DoD employees in _only\
    \ four months,_ (10)) then we need to consider the repercussions. Yes, it is important\
    \ for the\nUS to protect its interests, but not at the expense of the people.\n\

    Most of the military budget funds useless projects. Consider our military bases\
    \ and associated infrastructure. The DoD\u2019s own report illustrates the issue\
    \ at hand. The report estimates that the US military is currently operating with\
    \ 22% excess base-capacity that serve no strategic purpose (1).\u201D\n\n22% is\
    \ not most. Besides, our military bases are needed in order to prevent certain\
    \ nations from becoming a military threat. For example, we have plenty of military\
    \ bases in South Korea and Japan and without these military bases, communism would\
    \ take over these bases and we lose a capitalist trading partner in exchange for\
    \ a communist one, which tend to produce inferior products. This is why China\
    \ stuff tends to have poor quality; impart because they are a communist nation.\
    \ This affects America down the line because a lot of trading is done with capitalist\
    \ countries in some industries and if thy were communist, we would not get stuff\
    \ as good.\n\n\u201CThe report estimates that the US military is currently operating\
    \ with 22% excess base-capacity that serve no strategic purpose (1).\u201D I have\
    \ an idea for the spending. You know how the US used to contain the spread of\
    \ communism? Well, we can use our military to eliminate communism in areas where\
    \ it exists. This won\u2019t apply to China and North Korea, but would apply to\
    \ places like Cuba, where communism is prevalent and not a Chinese buffer. The\
    \ belief of communism is that anyone who isn't communist in a communist country\
    \ and openly acclaims to not be communist gets killed. Because of that, the US\
    \ military can increase its spending to do things like liberate Cuba from Communism.\n\
    \n\u201Can increase in the military budget will necessarily mean that the US is\
    \ any more protected.\u201D This is true however other regions of the world and\
    \ American interests would be more protected. From eliminating terrorism to what\
    \ I also think should happen of eliminating communist rule in places where we\
    \ can, we need military spending to free the world from tyranny.\n\n\u201CInstead,\
    \ American taxpayer dollars are wasted, preventing the government from fulfilling\
    \ its obligation to the people by giving them a safe, secure nation.\u201D Our\
    \ nation is already safe and secure. If America pulls out of its military bases,\
    \ then the areas where we pull out our military could go tyrannical. It happened\
    \ in the middle east when Obama pulled troops out. Obama pulled troops out of\
    \ Iraq once it was perceived that they were no longer needed and when that happened,\
    \ a power vacuum existed, and that vacuum was filled by ISIS.\n\nYour 6th link\
    \ didn\u2019t work. You basically say that when American influence is involved,\
    \ that that causes the terrorism. However, if this were true, then the following\
    \ would be true:\n\n-There would be no sharia law in Iran. They have a slogan,\
    \ \u201CNeither west nor east\u201D which basically means that they reject intervention\
    \ from both US and USSR influence. They have among the most amount of tyranny\
    \ in the arab world because of their extreme sharia law. Here are some links that\
    \ show what it\u2019s like:\n\n[1](http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Iran.html)\\\
    \n[2](https://clarionproject.org/womens-rights-iran-5-laws-will-appall-you/)\n\
    \nLebanon and Israel, which has had a high amount of western influence and former\
    \ occupation by the U.K and France would be under sharia law in rebellion. However,\
    \ they are not, at least not historically. They are historically democracies.\
    \ Due to the Arab spring, which came right after decolonization by the west, human\
    \ rights plummeted in most muslim influenced countries for women and homosexuals.\n\
    \nIn short, US influence-> Secular law. Without US influence-> Tyrannical law.\
    \ The US defends reasonable freedom worldwide.\n\n\u201CPape, in his University\
    \ newspaper also mentioned that \u201C95 percent of all suicide attacks since\
    \ 1980 have had in common is not religion but a specific strategic objective:\
    \ to compel a democratic state to withdraw combat forces from territory the terrorists\
    \ consider their homeland or prize greatly...\u201D (8).\u201D If this were true,\
    \ then explain why there is a bunch of terrorism/rape in Europe when the muslim\
    \ population in Europe skyrocketed. If you blame historical colonization, the\
    \ US and Australia were once colonies. There are many areas that are still colonies\
    \ to this day. Does this mean that terrorists come from these areas? No.\n\nIf\
    \ the US is going to spend more money on the military, then we need to ask ourselves\
    \ where the funds are going.\n\n\u201CEven if an iota of the money is spent on\
    \ increased military intervention\u201D This is poor spelling. Just wanting to\
    \ put that out there for the voters so I get the spelling point.\n\nBut anyway,\
    \ you said that we need to ask where these funds will be going too? I\u2019m suggesting\
    \ that the funds could go to implementing more bases in places like Iran and Cuba\
    \ to expand freedom and to save the lives of gays and women killed in Iran as\
    \ well as anti-communist people in Cuba. Then, the world will be a better place.\n"

  content: "**How we spend the\nmoney**\n\nIt is fine to have a plan for how the funds\
    \ are spent, but\nit should have been included in round 1. I should not have to\
    \ wait till round 2\nfor some semblance of a plan. Changing your advocacy by stating\
    \ that the US\nshould use the funds to liberate Cuba and Iran is shifting the\
    \ goal posts,\nwhich is defined as demanding from an opponent that they address\
    \ more points\nafter answering the initial argument (1). This is bad because it\
    \ creates an\nunfair advantage in which my opponent and keep on changing his advocacy\
    \ and force\nme to answer it. Reject his plan because it gives an unneeded skew\
    \ in favor of\nPro.\n\n**Waste**\n\nIf 22% of our money goes to defunct bases,\
    \ and all funds\nwill evaporate by 2024 anyway due to administrative costs, then\
    \ obviously there\nis no long-term basis for suggesting that our security is bolstered.\n\
    \n**Communism?**\n\nEven if you reject my analysis as to why my opponent cannot\n\
    use his plan, the plan itself is bad. The plan seems to be to invade Iran and\n\
    Cuba at the same time. The US would likely be able to destroy both nations. The\n\
    question is, do we want to? Iran\u2019s military includes over 1 million active\
    \ and\nreserve troops, 261 navy ships, and over 1,000 tanks (3). Also, consider\
    \ Iran\u2019s\nally, China, which helped modernize Iran\u2019s military by giving\
    \ them anti-ship\nmissiles and developing their nuclear program (4). If we were\
    \ to attack Iran,\nwe would risk having China step in or assist Iran indirectly.\
    \ Cuba\u2019s communist\nnewspaper recounts their ages old alliance with China\
    \ as well (5). China can\ndamage us significantly. The Task and Purpose summarizes\
    \ a government report\nthat conclude that due to climbing Chinese military spending,\
    \ they have\ndominance in anti-satellite weaponry, air defenses, and ballistic\
    \ missiles. The\nreport concludes that if we went to war with China right now,\
    \ we would lose (2).\n\nEven if we won the war, the wasted funds would not justify\
    \ the lives\nlost. Are we withdrawing troops from other bases to attack? How could\
    \ we divide\nup our military and go to war with Cuba and Iran at the same time?\
    \ If China\nwere to aid Iran, then it would take a lot more troops and hardware\
    \ to defeat\nthem, expending our resources as we face a two-front war against\
    \ Iran and Cuba.\n\n**Intervention = Bad**\n\nUS intervention begets terrorism.\
    \ Even if you do not buy my\nstatistics proving this, consider recruitment. The\
    \ Brookings Institute suggests\nthat nearly 20,000 people were recruited to ISIS\
    \ due to its \u201Cdeft use of propaganda\n(6).\u201D US influence increases recruitment\
    \ by victimizing the people we are\nsupposed to help. Look toward my Abu Gharib\
    \ evidence and other stats that remain\nun-refuted.\\\nMy opponent brings up Lebanon\
    \ and Israel as two countries\nthat the US influenced and subsequently bettered\
    \ their human rights record.\nWhere is the evidence that French occupation bettered\
    \ Lebanon\u2019s human rights\nrecord? Also, it is not fair to compare aid to\
    \ Israel with military intervention\ninto countries that don\u2019t want us there.\n\
    \nAlso, it was the Arab Spring which caused sectarian bloodshed\nin Syria and\
    \ allowing for ISIS to form out of the ensuing conflict, which is\nripe for caliphate-forming\
    \ as it can use the violence to illustrate that the US\nand Western forces are\
    \ victimizing Muslims. The Guardian shows that 80% of Syria is\nin poverty, and\
    \ life expectancy is cut by 20 years (7).\n\n**Grammar**\n\nWhat is wrong with\
    \ my spelling there? In any case, if judges\ncan still read my case, I don\u2019\
    t see any reason to dock me a point. That said, Pro\nuses an incorrect apostrophe\
    \ in his case:\\\n\u201CI'll simply publish an argument because the current rules\n\
    of the debate doesn't state that my opponent goes first.\u201D\n\n**The US Military\
    \ Defends\nFreedom**\n\nMy opponent needs to tell me how an increase in the military\n\
    will necessarily result in a more protected world. By just increasing our\nmilitary\
    \ spending, a lot of it is wasted on cost overruns, defunct bases, and\nout of\
    \ control administrative costs that will evaporate the budget by 2024 (8).\nEven\
    \ if we see some security benefit, it will only last till 2024 when the\nbudget\
    \ combusts.\n\n**Arguments with No Impact**\n\nBoth sides support it.\\\nThis\
    \ does not matter. Regardless of support, it is still bad.\n\nTechnology.\\\n\
    This is a non-unique argument. Technological innovation can occur in any other\n\
    sector or firm.\n\n**Europe & Rape?**\n\nFirst off, you lack a source. Second,\
    \ these incidents could\neasily be because of their frustration due to US intervention.\n\
    \n**Extend**\n\nExtend my evidence showing that by 2024, administrative costs\n\
    will evaporate the military budget.\\\nExtend my copious studies showing a connection\

    \nMy opponent mentions the Cuba-China alliance. However, we spend more on our\
    \ military then China and Cuba put together. If the Chinese army was stronger\
    \ than ours, then they would have kicked us out of South Korea and Japan especially\
    \ since China is closer and therefore would have an easier time. If they can barely\
    \ beat us while having almost home field advantage, how could China beat us on\

    \ at the same time?\u201D Since the US military is 2.1x the size of Iran as was\
    \ stated earlier, my rough sketch for this is to send maybe 650K troops to Iran,\
    \ 650K troops to Cuba, we still have our reserve troops to defend the US homeland.\
    \ I also support using more military spending to try to develop robot soldiers\
    \ because they are cheaper then soldiers to maintain, they are tougher soldiers,\
    \ they are harder to destroy and in the event that they do get destroyed, we destroyed\
    \ a robot rather than a human being. I apologize if this is shifting the goalposts\
    \ but it\u2019s what military spending can go towards. I should have mentioned\
    \ this earlier.\n\n\u201CUS intervention begets terrorism.\u201D Iran has a history\
    \ of rejecting western influence and they have sharia law today. This remains\

    \ motivation, they commit terrorism and the US needs to exert their military muscle\
    \ to subdue ISIS.\n\n\u201CUS influence increases recruitment by victimizing the\
    \ people we are supposed to help. Look toward my Abu Gharib evidence and other\
    \ stats that remain un-refuted.\u201D You didn\u2019t post that source.\n\n\u201C\

    \ perpetrate\nmilitary coups of communist nations, (of which there are 6, including\
    \ China\naccording to PRI, (1)) call on our NATO allies for help, and use the\
    \ money we\nare spending on useless bases to do all of this. These are all new\
    \ planks to\nthe plan that my opponent is using. This is a clear case of shifting\
    \ the goal\nposts once again. This mitigates my ability to respond to the arguments\
    \ and\nshould be considered when judging the debate.\n\n**Moving $**\n\nMy opponent\
    \ is not justifying an increase in military spending by\nusing allocated funds\
    \ elsewhere. Moreover, with NATO at our beck and call, as\nmy opponent brings\
    \ up, and no real justification as to why we should increase\nmilitary spending,\
    \ it seems that my opponent\u2019s plan does not require new funds.\nIf my opponent\
    \ is not allocating new funds, then he ultimately fails to meet\nhis burden in\
    \ the debate.\n\n**War**\n\nMy opponent wants to eliminate communist governments\
    \ and replace\nthem. It should be noted that of the 5 communist nations on Earth,\
    \ Iran is not\none of them. The US would be warring against 6 nations under my\
    \ opponent\u2019s plan.\\\nOne of the communist nations that we would be going\
    \ to war with\nwould be North Korea (NK), which has over 1k artillery pieces aimed\
    \ at South\nKorea (SK) according to the South China Morning Post (2). In the event\
    \ of a conventional\nwar, NK would not even need to utilize their burgeoning nuclear\
    \ program to be a\ncredible threat. Rob Givens, who spent four years stationed\
    \ in SK estimates\nthat if a war broke out between the US and NK, up to 20k people\
    \ would die a day\n(3).\\\nExtend my evidence, which, unlike what my opponent\
    \ claims, does\nnot just show a video, but also summarizes a DoD report that concluded\
    \ that the\nUS would lose if it got into a war with China because of China\u2019\
    s increasing military\ninvestment (4). Remember, we are not just toppling China\u2019\
    s government, but all\ncommunist nations as well as Iran. My opponent estimates\
    \ that only 650k troops\nwould be necessary to win. China has over 2 million troops\
    \ alone (5).\\\nThe RAND Corp. estimates that 90% of bilateral trade between the\n\
    US and China would cease in the event of a year-long military conflict as shipments\n\
    are forced to traverse a war-zone (14). As a major destination of Chinese\ngoods,\
    \ (China ships 18% of their exports to the US (6)) and as a major seller to\n\
    China, (China was the United States' 3rd largest goods export market in 2017\n\
    (13), it should be no surprise that economic destruction would likely occur in\n\
    a war between the US and China. In a Yearlong war, RAND estimates that the US\n\
    GDP would decrease by 5-10%, while China\u2019s would decrease by 25%. (14). Jobs\n\
    relating to exports, and companies that depend on the Chinese marketplace would\n\
    immediately suffer, causing lay-offs, and the dissolution of businesses.\\\nMy\
    \ opponent\u2019s solution is to invest in robot soldiers. Even if the\nrobots\
    \ were cheaper when factoring in inevitable cost overruns, my opponent is\nnot\
    \ considering the piece of evidence which states that by 2024, admin. costs\n\
    would account for the entire military budget.\n\n**NATO**\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely\
    \ that many would support our endeavor to eliminate\nthe government of China.\
    \ China is a major trade partner of practically every nation\non Earth. They are\
    \ the largest exporter according to the Balance (6). Why would\nour allies want\
    \ to risk getting rid of a cheap supply of goods?\\\nPropaganda\\\nMy opponent\
    \ asserts that propaganda is something that we cannot\ncontrol. This is not true.\
    \ The Saudi-and-US-backed war in Yemen aimed at\ndestroying the Houthis hurt the\
    \ region. According to the World Bank, only half\nof all health facilities in\
    \ Yemen are functioning, while even those that due\nface shortages in medicine\
    \ and equipment (7). Our actions in the region have\ncaused part of the issue\
    \ due to frequent mishaps in which our bombs destroyed\nhospitals (8), school-buses\
    \ (9), and even houses (10).\n\nAQAP has used the conditions to their advantage\
    \ by pursuing\npopulism. They overtook the port city of Mukalla and lessened taxes,\
    \ supplied\nmedicine, and created propaganda showcasing how they treat the people\
    \ in the\ncity. One 47-year old resident summed up the sentiment of Mukalla:\\\
    \n\u201CI prefer that al Qaeda stay here, not for Al Mukalla to be\nliberated...\
    \ The situation is stable, more than any \u2018free\u2019 part of Yemen. The\n\
    alternative to al Qaeda is much worse (11).\u201D\\\nCross-apply my evidence regarding\
    \ US interventionism being a key\nreason as to why many suicide bombings happen.\\\
    \nOur actions which destabilized the region allowed more support for\nthe group.\
    \ We can and should control this with no more new intervention.\n\n**Lebanon**\n\
    \nWhile it is contested that French involvement was the reason for\nLebanon being\
    \ less \u201Cmessed up,\u201D there is no causal principle established. How\n\
    exactly did French occupation change them?\\\nLebanon is not a Western-style democracy\
    \ and is very corrupt.\nTransparency International ranks it 143/180, landing it\
    \ in the top 40 most\ncorrupt nations on Earth (12).\n"

  content: "As this debate winds down, let us focus on the most important\nissues\
    \ in the round and see why the negation clearly wins the debate.\n\n**Shifting\
    \ the Goal Posts**\n\nThroughout the\ndebate, my opponent has changed his advocacy\
    \ too many times. His R1 post did\nnot mention where the money would be going\
    \ or if we were investing in robot\nsoldiers. However, since his R1 he has advocated\
    \ for NATO allies to get involved,\nusing all our active troops to attack Cuba\
    \ and Iran, the investment in robot\nsoldiers, and using the funds from the strategically\
    \ defunct bases to fund this\nas well. Clearly, this needed to be mentioned in\
    \ R1 instead of adding multiple\nparts to the plan throughout the debate because\
    \ it moves the goal posts. I understand\nif my opponent did not mean this:\\\n\
    \u201C...but I\u2019m wanting\nto enforce anti communism across places where it\
    \ exists,\u201D\\\nto indicate that he\nwanted to invade NK or China. However,\
    \ my opponent still unfairly skews the\ndebate by adding to his advocacy while\
    \ half-way into the debate.\n\n**China Alliance**\n\nI mention all the\nway earlier\
    \ in the debate that the alliance between the 2 countries being targeted\nby my\
    \ opponent, (Iran and Cuba,) and China would likely manifest itself in some\n\
    sort of intervention on behalf of China. My opponent posted a link from The\n\
    Diplomat which indicated that there were limits to the relationship between\n\
    Iran and China. Regarding Cuba, my opponent stated that China was not as strong\n\
    as our military, and we could easily beat them. I offered evidence suggesting\n\
    why, even if we could beat them, we would suffer economically. My opponent mentions\n\
    that China is too weak to fight with us on the other side of the world against\n\
    us with Cuba. Given the increase in military investment that has led China to\n\
    be considered a military threat according to various, already mentioned\nsources,\
    \ I do not see why locating their ships and guns elsewhere is going to\nbe an\
    \ issue. My opponent also discusses that China would need new troops, and\nthat\
    \ they would be untrained. My own source from previous rounds suggest that\nChina\
    \ has roughly 2 million troops.\\\nMoreover, the\narticle published by The Diplomat\
    \ suggesting that the Iran-China relationship\nis not as great as first perceived\
    \ does mention that the countries do not always\nsee each other as allies. Yet,\
    \ the same article characterizes both regimes as remaining\ncordial in the past,\
    \ with arms and crude being sold between both countries. The\npossibility of war\
    \ with China, even indirectly, would limit our bilateral trade,\ndestroy our economy,\
    \ and cause needless casualties.\n\n**Waste**\n\nMy evidence suggesting\nthat\
    \ by 2024, administrative costs and the cost of hiring too many people will consume\n\
    the entire budget has not been mentioned by my opponent at all. Ergo, even if\n\
    there was an increase in military defense, it would not last for long. All those\n\
    wars that my opponent wants to start would be seriously constrained by the\nbudget\
    \ crunch, limiting our ability to procure new weapons, hire new troops, or\nhire\
    \ PMCs.\n\nAlso, American taxpayer dollars would be wasted with flagrant cost\
    \ overruns,\nworthless bases, and a bloated workforce.\n\n**Radicalization**\n\
    \nMy opponent basically\ncedes this point. I show how Western influence has not\
    \ benefitted Lebanon, Israel,\nor any other country that it was supposed to help.\
    \ Moreover, my evidence of\nhuman rights abuses leading to recruitment or radicalization\
    \ suggests that\nWestern influence has worsened conditions where terror is occurring,\
    \ causing\nmore problems in the future. I even give a case study from Yemen which\
    \ shows\nthat outside influence from the US and Saudi Arabia indirectly allowed\
    \ AQAP to\nflourish and grow bigger through their propaganda.\n\n**Defending Freedom**\n\
    \nIf we are taking all our active troops and using them to\ninvade Iran and Cuba,\
    \ then what happens to our allies? My opponent specifies\nthat reserve troops\
    \ would be used to defend the US at home. If every single active\ntroop is removed\
    \ from SK as well as our other bases, then my opponent\u2019s claims\nabout the\
    \ needed bases to protect our allies completely falls as his own plan\nrequires\
    \ the active troops who are lodged in bases. Without a buffer zone\nbetween NK\
    \ and SK, NK is more likely to strike SK. China could expand our\ninfluence if\
    \ we withdraw from the bases surrounding them. Overall, my opponent\u2019s\nplan\
    \ runs contrary to US military objectives.\n\n**NATO**\n\nMy opponent\nsuggests\
    \ that because NATO hates communism, they would be perfectly fine\ntoppling 2\
    \ governments. Do not oversimplify the issue. Remember that China is a\nkey ally\
    \ to both Cuba and Iran. NATO wants cheap goods from China and does not\nwant\
    \ to be punished because they attack 2 countries that are close to China.\nChina\
    \ isn\u2019t new to using their economic prowess to strongarm countries into\n\
    doing what they want. The current trade war between the US and China showcases\n\
    this perfectly. Would NATO nations want to risk this? I don\u2019t know, but NATO\u2019\
    s\nhelp is not guaranteed.\n"

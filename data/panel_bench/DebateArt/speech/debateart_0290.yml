  content: 'The resolution is "Ordering Drinks with no ice at a fastfood drive-thru"


    Both debaters have an equal burden of proof because this is just asking which
    one is generally best, ordering with ice or without.


    1. In drive-thrus the drink stations for making drinks typically have buttons
    that once pressed automatically fill the cup, which usually assume the cupe is
    filled with anywhere between 50%-75% ice depending what the company prefers. When
    you ask for no ice, the drink making is no longer automatic and the drinks must
    be manually made by holding down a button, which prevents the employee from bagging
    the order or making the specialty drinks or floats while the drink machine is
    pouring. This may seem like it is just a few second delay, but customers are usually
    more loyal to the drive-thru itself than any particular fast food chain. This
    means when you order a drink with no ice, you rudely force the people behind you
    to wait longer for food, and potentially cause a longer line to form driving disloyal
    customers to the fastfood chain next door. This loss of customers mean less profit
    and eventially the cost of drinks will rise even more, hurting your pocket book
    in the long run.


    2. The drinks without ice are hot. They are slightly below room temperature and
    honestly taste like shit. With a few exceptions, most people ordering drink with
    no ice are getting at most 2 or 3 extra sips of soda, but it is hot shitty tasting
    soda. Even at slightly below room temperature coming out of the machine, it takes
    most people atleast 20 minutes to drink the soda, meaning that after about 5 minutes
    they''re just drinking hot soda. It''s honestly retarded. They the extra few sips
    of soda is not worth it.


    3. The most common drinks ordered in the drive-thru are high calorie drinks. When
    you order them without ice, really you are just being a fat ass. We know the drink
    tastes like shit without ice, so now all you are doing is just looking to shove
    as much excess calories into your body as possible at this point. It''s just like
    the idiots who want their sandwiches custom made. There are chefs that make well
    into the 6 figures in a test kitchen who have studied food and food combinations
    their whole life, before a fastfood joint rolls out a product, anyone who thinks
    they can improve on what those people create by saying something stupid like "Extra
    Pickles Please", is either a professional colleague who happens to disagree, or
    some retard who needs to be sterilized.


    Conclusion- **Please Do not be a fat ass, who holds up the line and drives up
    the cost of delicious beverages by being an idiot who asks for no ice.** (Please
    disregard if you have teeth or gum sensitivity.

  content: 'The claims made by my opponent (with no sources to support them) show
    that he is taking the position of the employee and/or owner of a fast food chain
    that feels inconvenienced by customers who make special orders, such as requesting
    a beverage without ice. However, this indirectly points to the exact reason why
    customers are and should be allowed to order beverages without ice; Customer preference
    and customer service!


    First of all, as is well known, ordering a beverage without ice allows the customer
    to get more beverage;


    > When ordering a drink at a coffee shop or bar, there''s nothing worse

    > than getting too much ice. Businesses occasionally do this to fleece

    > customers out of a full drink. Consequently, a generation of beverage

    > connoisseurs have begun ordering drinks with an explicit request: _no ice please._


    [Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/07/is-ordering-drinks-without-ice-cheating/340421/).


    And despite my opponent claiming that ordering without ice only gives you "a few
    sips" more, the reality is that the amount of ice served in many beverages occupies
    half the cup or more! Businesses actually know this and sometimes try to penalize
    customers who order without ice by serving only half a beverage, as in this example;


    > When she finally called me over to get my drink, I

    > was handed... half a cup of lukewarm chai. I thought maybe she had

    > forgotten to add milk or something, so I asked why it was so empty. She

    > said, very simply, deadpanned even, "That''s what you get when you ask

    > for no ice." I asked why that is and her response was, "We usually fill

    > it up all the way with ice."


    [Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/07/is-ordering-drinks-without-ice-cheating/340421/).


    Businesses that try to force customers to accept ice against their wishes or refuse
    to allow special orders like this are going to likely offend and drive away otherwise
    loyal customers. Allowing special orders such as ''no ice'' will build brand loyalty,
    which was the goal of Burger King''s longstanding slogan;


    > "Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce. Special orders don''t upset us. All we
    ask is that you let us serve it your way!"


    [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King_advertising).


    Ironically, my opponent actually uses special orders where customers attempt to
    change the pickles on their sandwich as an opportunity to attack "retards" who
    would choose to do this, but Yelp user ''Mary M.'' has a rebuttal for that;


    > McDonald''s was so pissy about "special orders" that I never bothered to

    > eat there. Sorry, no, I don''t want a pickle on my hamburger, I think

    > that''s vile, I''ll do without your nastyburger rather than eat it with a

    > pickle on it.


    [Source](https://www.yelp.com/topic/boston-do-special-orders-actually-bother-anybody-in-fast-food).


    So as we can see, customers will take their business elsewhere when stubborn fast-food
    employees try to push back against special orders such as requesting a beverage
    without ice.


    On top of everything else, the ice machines at fast food restaurants are often
    filthy!


    > Over the past decade, several studies have been done that have warned people
    of ice and ice machine contamination, including a study done by The Mail on fast-food
    franchises that found ice from six out of 10 fast food restaurants has more bacteria
    than toilet water.

    Suffice to say; _"No ice please!"_

    of supposedly not responding to several of the more childish claims from his opening
    statements. However, the audience should be reminded that opening statements are
    for making initial arguments. My rebuttals actually begin here.


    First, let''s look at my opponent''s behavior;


    > Anyone who is stupid enough...

    >

    > ...you are just being a fat ass.

    >

    > ...some retard who needs to be sterilized.

    >

    > ...an idiot who asks for no ice.


    Most of my opponent''s argument boils down to these sorts of simple and ad hominem
    insults. He accuses me of supposedly not responding to his points, and yet he
    himself has not responded to my point that treating his customers in this disgusting
    manner will drive them away. Alternatively, just showing his customers some basic
    respect by acknowledging that they have valid reasons for requesting a beverage
    without ice would be to his own advantage.


    > ...customers higher drink prices...


    My opponent claimed (with no source to support the claim) that drink prices would
    increase because customers who order a beverage with no ice are holding up the
    line. Even if we give him the benefit of the doubt and assume this is true, I
    have already demonstrated that his own attitude toward his customers is driving
    them away. So my opponent himself is driving up the price of beverages.


    > ...in thee kitchen ice usually comes in a kind of chest where customers can''t
    get their grubby hands on it...


    The source I provided states that the reason for unclean ice machines was that
    employees fail to clean the machine regularly. My opponent''s claim about the
    ice coming from a "chest" also contradicts his opening statement where he insisted
    a machine automatically fills the cups with a set percentage of ice.


    > My points about excess calories...


    My opponent broadly accuses everyone who orders a beverage without ice of being
    a "fat ass" with minimal evidence to support such an attack. In fact, I personally
    consume these types of beverages regularly and without ice, yet I am neither overweight
    nor unhealthy. My opponent''s claim is baseless and unsubstantiated, in addition
    to being an [ad hominem logical fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem).


    > \[We are\] debating whether customers should order drinks with no ice.


    Which is exactly what I have done. I have demonstrated that the reason to order
    a beverage without ice is to avoid bacteria ridden ice machines and to get a larger
    quantity of beverage. This is in the interest of the customer ordering the beverage,
    but is also in the interest of the business since pushing back against special
    orders of this type will cause customers to take their business elsewhere.

    **Ordering drinks with no ice at a fastfood drive-thru**


    I am con on this issue. My opponent is pro. It is not a debate on whether customers
    should be allowed special orders or to order drinks with no ice. They clearly
    should be allowed to order drinks with no ice. It is about "should" they order
    drinks with no ice. I have to prove most of the time they shouldn''t, my opponent
    has to prove most of the time they should.


    Reasons I gave that they should get ice; more empty calories making them fatter,
    drink tastes like shit hot, increases the customer''s wait time behind them, ultimately
    increasing drink prices.


    Pro has not contested any of these things successfully or has dropped them completely.
    Despite my poor performance he has surprisingly performed worse thus far.


    The only point relative to the actual resolution of **whether a customer should
    ask for no ice**. is the fact he pointed out ice machines are disgusting. The
    studies he cites though test dining room ice machines where thousands of people
    put their filthy hands. I pointed out that in the drive trhough they use an ice
    bucket and in my store it is sanitized daily and so is the ice scoop that is used
    to gather ice. So drive through ice is way less filthy in general.


    > The source I provided states that the reason for unclean ice

    > machines was that employees fail to clean the machine regularly. My

    > opponent''s claim about the ice coming from a "chest" also contradicts

    > his opening statement where he insisted a machine automatically fills

    a machine fills it with a set amount of beverage and companies have policies on
    how much to scoop into it. I have explained this.


    ______________________________________________________________________


    I should win this debate when we look at what was argued relative to the resolution
    which is "should customers get ice". They answer is yes. Now to address a few
    points nagging me.


    > I personally consume these types of beverages regularly and without ice,

    > yet I am neither overweight nor unhealthy. My opponent''s claim is

    > baseless and unsubstantiated, in addition to being an [ad hominem logical fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/ad-hominem).


    Not everyone who smokes has lung cancer, that doesn''t make it healthy. We all
    know coke is unhealthy so your statement is silly. Also calling people a fat ass
    is not ad hominem, not all insults are. An ad hominem attack is if I were to say
    something like "You can''t trust his opinion on how to eat healthy, because he
    is black" If you use the insult as a way to dismiss an argument it then now sometimes
    become ad hominem.


    My opponent keeps bringing up sources, I assume it is because the debate awards
    source points. The category should be ignored because this is largely a philosophical
    debate, and besides that I''m an expert on the subject because I have been working
    at fastfood since 1999. Him quoting articles by experts is not superior source
    material than an actual expert engaging in a debate with him. It doesn''t make
    me automatically right,but I am

    <https://www.debateart.com/debates/1042>\

    <https://www.debateart.com/debates/975>\

    I will try my best to argue against that idea.


    **Foreword:**\

    I personally believe that my opponent is a racist. However, as I have stated in
    the description, this debate isn''t about insulting each other. I will refrain
    from using any personal attacks, and I hope my opponent will do the same. The
    point of this debate is to challenge each other''s viewpoints, not to insult each
    other. Good luck to my opponent, and I hope that he will change his mind. Let''s
    begin.


    **ARGUMENTS:**\

    Deporting someone because you don''t like their skin color is racist. My opponent
    wants exactly that: deporting all non-black residents of Africa from the continent.
    He said, and I quote:


    > "Deporting people who live in Africa that aren''t Black is exactly what I''m
    saying."


    He attempts to justify mass deportations with the three following claims:


    - All non-blacks that live in Africa only do so for natural resources, eugenics,
    and sexual pleasure from children. \[1\]

    - Arabs, Europeans, and Asians have damaged Africa by colonizing it. \[1\]

    - North Africa was stolen by Arabs and belongs to Black Africans. \[1\]


    Each of these claims is untrue, and I will debunk them below.


    **Non-Blacks in Africa Just Want Resources, Eugenics, and Sex With Children**\

    This claim is obviously untrue, and just an attempt to villify the non-black residents
    of Africa. Assuming that millions of people are greedy, racist child-molesters
    solely because of their race is morally wrong. Hitler used the same tactic in
    World War 2: he painted all the Jews as greedy, subhuman spies because of the
    actions of a select few. Humans are individuals, not a homogeneous mass. The actions
    of a few people who happen to be white doesn''t make all whites evil. The same
    is true with any other race. Anyone who blames an entire race for the actions
    of a select few is a racist.


    **Non-Blacks Have Damaged Africa in the Past**\

    Again, my opponent blames millions of people for the actions of a select few.
    Just because some white people did bad things in the past doesn''t mean that all
    white people are responsible for the actions of a select few. Africa now consists
    of free nation-states, not colonies. The descendants of colonizers aren''t responsible
    for the actions of their ancestors.


    **North Africa Was Stolen by the Arabs**\

    The Arab conquest of Africa happened over a thousand years ago \[2\]. Nobody that
    lived back then is alive today. Arabs that live in North Africa today didn''t
    steal land from anyone. Black Africans alive today didn''t have their land stolen.
    People are individuals, not groups. Just because some Arabs in the past invaded
    Africa doesn''t mean you get to deport all Arabs today.

  content: 'My opponent started out by saying that "this debate isn''t about insulting
    each other and that he will refrain from using personal attacks." On the other
    hand, the first eight words that came out of his mouth is "I personally believe
    that my opponent is racist." You''ve already contradicted yourself, and if this
    is something that you personally believe to be true, then you should''ve kept
    an untrue comment like this to yourself.


    Yes, I personally stated that all non-black people should be removed, and thanks
    for quoting me because my statement "never" said anything about disliking someone''s
    skin color. If I said that, then please point to where everyone can find this
    false statement...My opponent is so hellbent on trying to prove to everyone that
    I''m racist to where he''s clearly missing the point to why I think that all non-black
    people should be removed from Africa. If he would''ve asked me, then I''d simply
    tell him why.


    Yes, I can easily and effortlessly justify why non-blacks should be removed, and
    I already gave you three reasons to which you can''t debunk. My I ask you a question?


    1. Why is De Beers in Africa?

    2. Why is Chromex Mining Ltd in Africa?

    3. What is MMG Mining Group doing in Africa?

    4. What is Kermas Investment Group doing in Africa?

    5. Anglo America Corporation?

    6. And on etc.,


    Here''s a list for more proof. [https://www.miningafrica.net/mining-companies-africa/...](https://www.miningafrica.net/mining-companies-africa/)
    My opponent may try to say that these swindlers are African-based, but the funding
    for these companies are all foreign-based. These swindlers are taking, taking
    & taking while never putting anything beneficial back in place. So, you actually
    think that foreigners go to Africa just so to mingle with the native people? Do
    you actually think that foreigners have the African people''s best interests at
    heart?


    It''s all about exploiting the people while raping the land. I''ll put in simpler
    terms...(Economic Interests)...If it''s not about economic interests, then why
    does America, France, China etc., have a military presence in Africa? I''ll wait.....................................So,
    what are these militaries protecting? Once again, as a nine-year vet with the
    USAF, I can personally tell you that most of Africa''s/Middle East''s conflicts
    are over natural resources.


    Case In point: You ever wonder why America has an opioid/heroin crisis? Did you
    know that Afghanistan''s Poppy production supplies 90% of illicit heroin globally?
    Are you aware that America & Afghanistan has a close connection? So, America "supposedly"
    invaded Afghanistan to fight terrorism. Former-FBI contractor Sibel Edmonds report
    on natural-resource corruption can be found here <https://www.activistpost.com/2018/03/before-us-troops-protected-poppies-in-afghanistan-there-was-no-opioid-epidemic-in-america.html>


    It''s a documented history of corrupt European missionaries in Africa from spreading
    diseases to sexual abuse of minors. I don''t even have to post links to prove
    this because all you have to do is Google it. Missionaries have been conducting
    eugenics for decades in Africa. Wiping out the people to get the resources. Nope,
    I''m not assuming of who''s doing what, and I never said all. You think that I''m
    speaking in absolutes in which I''m not...I speak in-general, and there''s a big
    difference among the two.


    Now you''re saying that Hitler painted all Jews as greedy and sub-human. I''m
    assuming your a white guy...Didn''t white Americans classify black people as three-fifths
    human? In addition to that, didn''t white Americans put this clause in the US
    Constitution?...I''m literally exposing your hypocrisy and contradictions with
    ease. There''s an old saying, which goes "people who live in glass house should
    never throw stones."


    I never said that all white people are evil. I said that the people who are causing
    the majority of problems in Africa are whites & Asians. You seem to forget that
    I said "non-Europeans who reside in Europe should be removed from Europe as well."
    Did I not say that?


    You just stated that Africa now consists of free nation-states. Africa was free
    before any colonizers arrived and divided the land. Yes, it''s known as the Berlin
    Conference which was a bunch of European racists who superimposed their domain
    on another continent. You can''t unify something by dividing it. This is a practice
    that''s known as "Divide & Conquer."...You are correct that the descendants of
    the colonizers aren''t responsible for the actions of their ancestors, but the
    descendants most certainly don''t have a problem with benefiting from what their
    ancestors did.


    Last, but not least, you said "that the Arab conquest of North Africa happened
    over 1,000 years ago, and that they didn''t steal the land from anyone"...Now
    would you explain to me what the term conquest means. I''ll wait........................So,
    what you''re saying is that Africans basically gave away their land for free.


    You also said that Arabs shouldn''t be deported either...At the same time, America
    is doing the exact same thing to Hispanics. Your hypocrisy is unreal. You''ll
    need to come back with a better argument because your very own comments are destroying
    your argument.

  content: '_Racism_ - the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics,
    abilities, or qualities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish
    it as inferior or superior to another race or races.


    ==================\

    **ARGUMENTS:**


    My opponent claims that he isn''t a racist, and that his reason for wanting deportations
    isn''t race. Really? Seriously? My opponent has stated that:


    - All non-blacks that live in Africa only do so for natural resources, eugenics,
    and sexual pleasure from children. \[1\]

    - All non-blacks living in Africa are leeches and bloodsuckers that have destroyed
    the great African civilizations. \[2\]


    Wanting to deport someone only on the basis of their race is **by definition**
    racist. My opponent believes that just because some non-black people in Africa
    have commited crimes, all non-black people in Africa should be deported. The same
    reasoning could be used to justify any kind of atrocity. Why shouldn''t Africans
    be all deported from Europe, Asia, North & South America, and Australia? Why shouldn''t
    Europeans be all deported from Asia, North & South America, and Australia? Deporting
    billions of people because of opaque historical events is stupid and wrong.


    # My opponent attempts to justify his outrageous and racist claims by pointing
    to many Western companies operating in Africa. Yeah... guess what? Companies can
    operate on different continents! Should Asians deport all Westerners because Nike
    and Adidas build sweatshops in Asia? Obviously not. My opponent''s reasoning is
    faulty. Instead of blaming whites, why doesn''t he move back to Africa and try
    to help it?

    on racism when it''s his very own race of people who''ve built a privileged lifestyle
    by brutalizing others for having brown skin while trying to make the claim that
    I''m racist. Wow!


    If you haven''t noticed...reverse racism doesn''t work on me. I can most definitely
    love my race without hating another race...Now, can that be said about your race?


    Here is what you said verbatim: "My opponent claims that he isn''t a racist, and
    that his reason for wanting deportations isn''t race. Really? Seriously? My opponent
    has stated that:"


    - "All non-blacks that live in Africa only do so for natural resources, eugenics,
    and sexual pleasure from children.

    - All non-blacks living in Africa are leeches and bloodsuckers that have destroyed
    the great African civilizations".


    So, you''re providing random quotes, but the random quotes are backed by facts
    and I''ll easily prove it.


    My reply is: If Europeans, Asians & Arabs are "Native" to other continents/countries,
    then why are they in Africa in the first place? That one question alone destroys
    your argument. I''ll ask this question again, but in a different manner so that
    you''re not confused.


    Explain to me, why did these foreigners (Europeans, Asians & Arabs) leave their
    Indigenous lands to come to Africa? I''ll wait.............................


    Now, when you put those questions into context with my quotes from above, then
    you''ll see that it can''t be disputed. You also may be asking, why can''t it
    be disputed? The reason to why it can''t be disputed is because Europeans, Asians
    and Arabs have a (Documented History) of committing the crimes that I spoke about
    in which my opponent quoted...Sir, you just proved my point without even knowing
    it.


    My opponent is trying to change the narrative because he doesn''t have an argument.
    The reason he doesn''t have an argument is because the crimes are 100% true, and
    all you have to do is research it.


    You''re now asking me "why shouldn''t Africans be deported from Europe, Asia,
    the Americas & Australia?" Sir, this is an African issue. To further answer his
    question...Give me a list of African Corporations that are mining the natural
    resources in these regions. After that, guide me to the fake missionary/eugenics
    programs that Africans are conducting in these regions. After you completed that,
    show me the hundreds of perverts who have been caught/charged with sexually assaulting
    underage children in these regions. I''ll wait...........................


    And if you were as educated as you claim to be, then you''d know that Africans
    were in those regions before most races even existed. There are African skeletal
    remains that pre-dates the current natives of those regions. It''s known as Forensic
    Anthropology.


    Yes, you''re right that companies can operate in other countries, but when you
    can''t conduct proper business, then you should be removed. You also spoke about
    Nike and Adidas sweatshops in Asia and should westerners be removed...The average
    Nike/Adidas "sweatshop" most likely won''t have westerners working in them to
    begin with.

    **REBUTALLS:**

    I''m racist. Wow!"


    You don''t know if I''m a white person or not, but you assume that I am just because
    I disagree with you. Is that not racism and identity politics? (I am indeed white,
    but you didn''t know that when you made the claim).\

    Further, you claim that my race is responsible for horrible crimes. The way you
    put that statement is wrong. The white race isn''t responsible for horrible crimes.
    Race is a skin color, it can''t be responsible or anything. Bad people _**who
    happen to be white**_ are the ones to blame. It''s wrong to characterize a group
    based on the actions of a few individuals. It''s like saying all black people
    are criminals, or that all Mexicans are drug dealers. **My skin color only cannot
    and does not make my a hypocrite in any way or form. What matters is not the color
    of your skin, but the content of your character.**


    > "Explain to me, why did these foreigners (Europeans, Asians & Arabs) leave their
    Indigenous lands to come to Africa?"


    You''re a foreign African living in the United States! Why don''t you go back
    to your indigenous land? Can''t you see how your argument is incredibly racist?\

    **I''ll tell you why non-blacks live in Africa:**


    - **They were born there.**

    - **They came to preach their religion.**

    - **They came to learn about the culture.**

    - **They came for work.**

    - **They came to retire.**

    - **They came to get an education.**


    And many other perfectly normal reasons! You, however, claim that all non-blacks
    live in Africa because they are greedy racist pedophiles. This is laughably untrue
    and cannot be proven.


    \===================


    **ARGUMENTS:**


    Saying that all members of a race are responsible for crimes commited by a tiny
    number of members of that race is, by definition, racist. It''s like if I were
    to call all black people criminals: racist and untrue. My opponent can call me
    uneducated, illogical, say that I don''t have an argument, or use other _ad hominems_.
    However, the following remains a fact:


    **Even if all of Con''s claims were true, that still doesn''t justify the mass
    deportation of ALL non-blacks from Africa.**


    Please bring some type of logical argument to the table next time. TheAtheist

    Nope, I didn''t say that your race was responsible for horrible crimes...I said

    Not to be rude, but where are you getting your information from? You then go on

    Yes, I agree, but didn''t white people colonize entire groups just for being another
    race? Hmmm. That''s racism 101, and it can''t be disputed...Yet again, you continue
    to preach that it''s not the color of skin, but the content of character.


    I''ll ask you again, when the white race held black people as slaves in America,
    did the white race hold and enslave these people because of their character?


    **This is what my opponent said: "I''ll tell you why non-blacks live in Africa:"**


    - **They were born there.**

    - **They came to preach their religion.**

    - **They came to learn about the culture.**

    - **They came for work.**

    - **They came to retire.**

    - **They came to get an education.**


    OK, so those who were born in Africa...where did their descendants come from?...Religion?
    Why would foreigners try to force a religion on another group of people who have
    their own religion?...Culture? That''s laughable because after Europeans colonized
    Africa''s civilizations, they took the artifacts and placed them in European museums,
    which generates millions annually. Work?...As in owning 90% of the fertile lands
    and wealth...Retire? Of course, if I owned 90% of the fertile land and wealth
    while indoctrinating the people with false idols, then I could retire as well...Education?
    Of course, education on how to maintain a racist system that can be passed down
    to the next generation.


    My opponent said "Saying that all members of a race are responsible for crimes
    committed by a tiny number of members of that race is, by definition, racist."


    May I ask, didn''t King Leopold II (a European) murder/mutilate over 10 million
    Congolese (African) people? Here''s a bit of proof <http://www.digitaljournal.com/blog/11297>
    And Here''s what the Dutch & British colonizers did in Namibia (Africa) <https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/brutal-genocide-colonial-africa-finally-gets-its-deserved-recognition-180957073/>

    > OK, so those who were born in Africa...where did their descendants come from?


    It doesn''t matter from where there descendants came from. **Their descendants

    someone? Well, you would do that, according to your logic!


    > "As in owning 90% of the fertile lands and wealth"


    Sources, please. Provide sources for the claim that non-blacks own 90% of African
    fertile lands and wealth.


    Finally, King Leopold''s horrible crime is unrelated to this topic. Everybody
    who participated in that crime or was a victim of that crime is already dead.

    My opponent thinks that pointing to other white people who do bad things somehow
    proves my hypocrisy. He says that because white people enslaved Africans hundreds
    of years ago, I''m a hypocrite. He says that because King Leopold murdered millions
    of people in his genocide, I''m a hypocrite. I am not a hypocrite, I do not hold
    any beliefs that contradict each other or have double standards.


    My opponent says that because SOME white people were racist to SOME white people

    picking through my quotes without giving the full quote.


    He keeps saying that "skin color is a race," which it is not...OK, so if skin

    Jamaican? As you can see, his logic makes no sense...


    Sir, Ethnicity is a race, not skin color.


    I keep trying to explain to my opponent, "TheAtheist," that I''m not blaming the

    a man in prison if (he) killed someone...


    As you can see, my opponent perfectly proved my point with that question. This
    goes on to say that if these foreigners are causing problems on someone else''s

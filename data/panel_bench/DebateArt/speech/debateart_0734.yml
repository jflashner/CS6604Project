  content: 'Since this is a test format, I will leave instructions at the end of each
    round to make things easy for my opponent and the voters to follow. Feel free
    to comment on how you felt about the format.


    Premise 1 == God is extremely unlikely to begin with.


    In order to accept the God Proposition, one must take many things on faith. We
    must assume The bible is true at least to some degree. Some more then others.
    We must also accept that magic exist. We must accept that heaven exist. We must
    accept that God is all powerful to the point being able to defy human logic. At
    some point, this becomes a steep bet.


    Premise 2 == God is not coherent with our model of the universe.


    By coherent I mean that the properties of God do not match what we would expect
    to see in physics. This further pushes The God Proposition into obscurity and
    makes it difficult to even imagine what God could even consist of or how we could
    know anything about God at all.


    God is suppose to be the necessary pieces of creation, but we have no good model
    for this in physics. The best thing we have is the fine tuning argument which
    is probably the best attempt to date, but still does not get us close enough to
    posit a God with any type of justification for doing so.


    Premise 3 == God has too many definitions.


    God is Love, God is Wrath, God is sin, God is all, God is nothing, God is something,
    God is mysterious, God is direct, God is candid, etc etc.


    There''s simply too many properties to god for it to be a real thing. God seems
    about as likely as a square circle that is White Black.


    Premise 4 == Pascal''s Wager Favors Atheism.


    Mostly just a side note for flavor, but fun fact, this is true. When the wager
    is actually done in semantic terms, then Atheism ends up giving you the best odds.
    This doesn''t quite prove or disprove anything. But for those gamblers out there
    that like to go with the best odds, this is it.


    There''s simply too many god claims and only one can be right. Choosing which
    heaven to go for and which hell to avoid and which profit to believe all ends
    up selling short.


    Logically speaking, Any God that even has a heaven for you is probably going to
    let you in even if you don''t believe in it because God would probably be that
    nice of a guy. So I think Atheism is a fine bet.


    Premise 5 == God wouldn''t make lightning debates.


    He just wouldn''t. Any true god would make these logically impossible because
    he simply doesn''t like them for some reason ;)


    Okay, so from here My opponent will be giving a rebuttal of my premises and then
    we''ll move on from there.

    two to our debate on God''s existence. In the spirit of this debate, I will try
    to be as concise as possible in my rebuttal. I will also try to state a short

    Negation


    In order to accept any proposition when dealing with questions of origins and
    cosmology in particular, a vast majority of conclusions must be taken on faith.
    In fact, the entire scientific method rests upon the concept of uniformity of
    nature, which is a faith based phenomenon. I have no concrete evidence the sun
    will come up tomorrow or water will boil at the same temperature as yesterday
    aside from that fact that these things happened in the past, which is circular
    reasoning, but its what scientists take on faith daily. Also, my opponent has
    used the word magic, however, God''s miracles are not magic, it is His ability
    to control the laws of nature and manipulate the time space matter continuum.

    Negation


    Our model of the universe unequivocally supports theism. It is scientifically
    sound to state the universe had a beginning. The big bang supports the existence
    of God strongly, things that have beginnings have causes.

    Only if you use the definitions of "god" from just about every world religion
    at once. That''s an unreasonable thing to do. When talking about God, since my
    opponent is an atheist, I will be using a more scientific definition. The Intelligent
    Mind that originated the sum totality of time space and a matter. As a Christian
    Theist that definition works perfectly for me as well.


    My opponent stated


    > "Logically speaking, Any God that even has a heaven for you is probably going
    to let you in even if you don''t believe in it because God would probably be that
    nice of a guy. So I think Atheism is a fine bet. "


    I believe the whole point behind Pascal''s wager was that hell was a very real
    threat, so this view of Pascal''s wager favoring atheism only works if you undermine
    the entire point of the wager in the first place.


    Finally, my opponent:


    > Premise 5 == God wouldn''t make lightning debates.

    >

    > He just wouldn''t. Any true god would make these logically impossible because
    he simply doesn''t like them for some reason ;)


    Actually, I think it is more scientifically sound to state that God has an issue
    with Elephantidae. Considering the wooly mammoths went extinct, mastodons went
    extinct, and African and Asian elephant populations are for the most part endangered,
    my opponent has made a real good choice of avatar.


    I am running out of characters, but here''s a short case for the God of the Bible
    in particular:


    1. Without presupposing that we were designed by a benevolent and truthful Creator,
    we could have no certain knowledge on literally anything. For all we know, in
    an atheistic universe, our senses and reasoning do not actually give us the truth
    about anything, and the world around us is vastly different than our senses tell
    us. The physical world we perceive may not be anything more than the delusions
    brought about by haphazardly organized cells and sensory organs that do not reflect
    what''s true in reality. If our senses were not created with the purpose of yielding
    us the truth, so I will ask my opponent, on what basis do you trust your sense
    perceptions enough that you believe we are having this debate?


    Thank you all!

    Well technically, assuming something because it happened in the past isn''t circular
    reasoning. Also, I would like to note that not all circular reasoning is fallacious.
    Only if it''s a vicious circle with no justification under at least one of the
    premises. It''s actually what''s called a Strong inductive argument which is not
    absolute knowledge like a tautology, but rather a probabilistic argument that
    has high probability of being true. In this case, The sun coming up and gravity
    have perfect track records, so they''re painfully likely.


    Science doesn''t take things on faith. They do presuppose, but only to the bare
    minimum. Theism presupposes to the bare maximum.

    sound to state the universe had a beginning. The big bang supports the existence
    of God strongly, things that have beginnings have causes.


    Well my problem here is with the word "unequivocally". While God is a sufficient
    cause. God has not yet been proven necessary. There are at least 3 competing models
    that have far more science behind them. So The God argument needs to put in more
    leg work to prove itself.


    > Only if you use the definitions of "god" from just about every world religion
    at once. That''s an unreasonable thing to do. When talking about God, since my
    opponent is an atheist, I will be using a more scientific definition. The Intelligent

    Theist that definition works perfectly for me as well.


    Well most of those definitions that I stated came from the bible alone. I''m okay
    with your definition for this debate. I would say that even using a properly basic
    God that just fits science, you''re still taking on way more presuppositions that
    most scientists would be uncomfortable justifying.


    > I believe the whole point behind Pascal''s wager was that hell was a very real
    threat, so this view of Pascal''s wager favoring atheism only works if you undermine
    the entire point of the wager in the first place.


    Well that''s why I said the modern version of pascal''s wager. The original version
    was used as a conversion tactic and didn''t use formal logic or probability. A
    statistician would model Pascal''s wager in a much different way and I guarantee
    that Atheism would have better odds because there is a concept in betting that
    basically amounts to "Bird in the hand equals two in the bush"


    The years your guaranteed are worth more than the years you don''t have. So wasting
    those years makes it a bad bet because the bet is too steep and the stakes are
    too high and even if I accepted that hell could exist, there is no way to know
    the right hell so choosing a religion might put me in worse trouble if I pick
    wrong while and atheist could get into more heavens.

    I based my epistemology on The principle of self evidence. I don''t use presuppositions
    because they''re fallacious in my humble opinion. If self evidence is true, then
    my senses are sound. That''s my best answer to that.


    We will now move to interrogation where my opponent will pose me no more than
    5 questions for test purposes because I want to make sure I have space to answer
    them. Then I answer and interrogate back.

    1. It is logically sound to conclude that everything that has a beginning has

    2. Are the laws of logic (non contradiction, identity, etc) human conventions?

    > 1. It is logically sound to conclude that everything that has a beginning has
    a cause, since the science bears out the fact that the universe is not eternal,
    why do you not agree we need a Cause?


    well to say that something had a beginning is either to say that it was formed
    from something else or to say that it popped into existence. In the first case,
    I would agree that there would be an "unformed form" But I don''t agree with the
    "uncaused cause" Because there are no recorded cases of anything every popping
    into existence. So I do believe in a cause, but I believe the cause is both physical
    and eternal.


    > 2. Are the laws of logic (non contradiction, identity, etc) human conventions?
    If so, are they subject to change?


    They are human inventions designed to describe reality, so they are congruent
    with reality. as for the second part, it depends what you mean. If you mean can
    we change the name or the rules. Then the answer is yes. But the event that it
    was describing would still happen, it just wouldn''t have a name anymore and the
    changed law may or may not describe reality anymore and if it does it might just
    end up overlapping with some other theoretical principle.


    > 3. What, in your opinion, made Christianity a unique and successful movement?
    What differentiated it from the other Messiah movements like Bar Kochba or Sevi?


    From what I know on the subject, there are two driving factors.


    A) Christianity was highly adaptive. It was flexible and assimilated the traditions
    of it''s followers. I think part of this is that the focus of the religion was
    around accepting Jesus and took some of the pressure off people to worry about
    individual practices. This allowed an environment for assimilation.


    B) Christianity was a pacifist religion which was a newer concept at the time
    and they took it to the extreme which overwhelming success. As you can tell pacifism
    has taken hold in modern society and Christianity happen to bet on the right horse
    because it seems to create superior societies to the old iron fist war societies.


    > 4. How do you know your senses are not deceiving you?


    I don''t, but what I do know is that they''re consistent and congruent with reality.
    So even if they''re wrong, they still work consistently and I can navigate reality
    just fine with them so it''s the difference between speaking English and Spanish.


    > 5. The universe bears evidence of fine tuning suitable for human life. What
    do you make of this?


    I''ve always had a problem with the phrase "fine tuning" because it automatically
    implies that there are these imaginary dials that can change physics. But the
    thing is that they''re called cosmological constants, not variables. Constants,
    by definition, cannot be changed. The universe functions the way it does because
    of the way it is structured now, there''s nothing "fine" about it.


    My other problem is that they cite the probabilities as being unreasonable, but
    they''re thinking about it from a human scale. 1% looks small to humans. But on
    a cosmic scale with all of the time and space in the world, a 1% chance is the
    same as being inevitable to happen at least once. So while the chances look small
    to humans, the chances don''t look small to the cosmos because they have all of
    the time and space in the world to roll the dice and wait for the win.


    Now for my Questions.


    1. How far away would something have to be before you would acknowledge that we
    shouldn''t even try to know it?


    2. If you were God, would you use The Bible (word for word) to spread your message.


    3. If a law was put in place preventing the teaching of religion to minors, do
    you think that Christianity would survive?


    4. Why does the apocalypse keeping getting pushed back?


    5. Do you think it''s fair for God to punish us for Original sin when we had no
    control over it?


    I await your answers and closing


    Good debate.

    '
- debater_name: Dustandashes
  content: 'Thank to my opponent as always. Some very good responses, now for my turn.


    I am posting this from my phone so it''s going to be a little concise:


    In response to number one, I would say it depends on what exactly we were talking
    about. In regards to God, within the Christian worldview even though God is transcendent
    He is not distant. As the apostle Paul said he is not far from any one of us.
    So think it would also be a matter if trying to find whatever we''re trying to
    find is a worth while pursuit. In this case I would argue God is the most worthwhile.


    Number two, I would yes. A book is timeless, so if I was trying to send an eternally
    true message I would use a venue that has a lot of longevity.


    Number three absolutely. Christianity is outright banned in many parts of the
    world, and yet we continue to flourish.


    Number four, well unfortunately many people who call themselves Christians have
    fallen into the trap of setting dates for Christ to come back. The Bible never
    gives the time though so we really can''t push anything back if there''s nothing
    there


    Number five, this one can get a bit in depth but I''ll try to briefly say that
    God doesn''t actively punish us for Adam''s sin, it''s that we are all the descendants
    of Adam so what happened to him was carried over to us. Like a domino effect.
    .


    I hope these answers were helpful. Thanks everyone

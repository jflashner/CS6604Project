    Since you asked me to define truth, I will provide the most straightforward "no
    bullshit" answer I can. Truth is that which is objectively real, and the way in
    which that which is real behaves in reality. A methodology for discerning the
    truth is one that accurately determines and interprets the existence and properties
    of that which exists.


    > he **scientific method** is an [empirical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical)
    method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science)
    since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, applying rigorous
    [skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skepticism) about what is observed,
    given that [cognitive assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science#Observation_inseparable_from_theory)
    can distort how one interprets the [observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception#Process_and_terminology).
    It involves formulating [hypotheses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis),
    via [induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning), based on such
    observations; [experimental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment) and measurement-based
    testing of [deductions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning) drawn
    from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on
    the experimental findings. These are _principles_ of the scientific method, as
    distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method#cite_note-3)

    The primary issue with the scientific method is that it is entirely empirical,
    and as such it can only deal with the properties of that which appears to exist.
    It cannot answer the question of "what" things are, but only how they appear to
    work.It also cannot discern what is real, and what merely appears to be real because
    it relies on observation and abstract mathematical formulas to reach it''s conclusions.

  content: "Firstly, thanks Sparrow for this debate.\n\n**Truth and Knowing its true**\n\
    \nThere is a difference between what is True, and how to tell it\u2019s true.\
    \ The low level truth about what our reality really is may never be knowable -\
    \ even though presumably there\u2019s is a true answer somewhere. This is a key\
    \ distinction: To be able to \u201Cdiscern the truth\u201D, any process must be\
    \ able to correctly ascertain whether or not a given fact is actually true or\
    \ not.\n\nTruth, as defined by my opponent is \u201Cthat which is objectively\
    \ real\u201D. I\u2019d prefer to use a formal definition than this, and state\
    \ that truth is:\n\n> \u201Cthe property of being in accord with fact or reality\u201D\
    \n\n<https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/truth>\n\nThe scientific method\
    \ is the application of Empiricism, as my opponent acknowledges in his description\
    \ of the scientific method. Briefly stated, Empiricism is essentially based upon\
    \ the claim that knowledge can only come from observation.\n\n<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empiricism>\n\
    \nThe reason this is important, is the qualifier that we have placed on truth:\
    \ that to be true, it _must be in accord with reality._ Almost by definition we\
    \ cannot discern whether things are specifically true or not without making some\
    \ comparison or validation against reality. This leads to something fundamental,\
    \ when looking at my opponents argument;\n\n> \u201CIt cannot answer the question\
    \ of \"what\" things are, but only how they appear to work.It also cannot discern\
    \ what is real, and what merely appears to be real because it relies on observation\
    \ and abstract mathematical formulas to reach it's conclusions.\u201D\n\nTo know\
    \ something is true, you must be able to confirm that it matches objective reality\
    \ - and that can only be done via observation of that reality. If you cannot determine\
    \ \u201Cwhat something is\u201D by observation - it is not possible to know what\
    \ that something is at all; as you cannot match the conclusion against reality.\
    \ If you cannot determine whether something is real or not via observation - you\
    \ will never know whether it is truly real as you cannot observe or know what\
    \ the true nature of that reality is.\n\nThese are not issues with science in\
    \ general, but epistemological problems which would render this \u201Ctruth\u201D\
    \ literally unknowable by any means in the cases my opponent lists.\n\n**The Primacy\
    \ of science.**\n\nBut what makes science the \u201Cultimate method\u201D? It\u2019\
    s in the evolving nature of science.\n\n_Creating truths:_\n\nImagine that there\
    \ is a black box, inside of which is the \u201Cultimate method\u201D, for discerning\
    \ truth. Out of this box you\u2019re given truths printed on pieces of paper.\
    \ You don\u2019t know how, why or where that truth was obtained.\n\nHow do you\
    \ know what is printed is true? Just by looking at the claim, there is no way\
    \ to tell.\n\nThe only way to tell whether the claim written on the paper is true:\
    \ is to verify the claim against the reality you observe.\n\nHow would you do\
    \ that? By validating the predictions of the claim are true, and by attempting\
    \ to find flaws or observational errors in what the claim states: IE following\
    \ the scientific method.\n\nIn this respect, any notional method of discerning\
    \ truth would itself have to follow the scientific method to validate itself as\
    \ true.\n\nGiven long enough, this notional method would effectively be proven\
    \ as a valid way to determine truth - always with an element of doubt that would\
    \ continue to require validation in order to be confident about its claims.\n\n\
    Effectively this would render reliance on the conclusions this black box makes\
    \ _scientific_.\n\n_Discerning truth._\n\nLets say the box didn\u2019t hand out\
    \ truth, but you put a truth inside. IE, you wrote a claim put it into the box,\
    \ and got a true/false answer?\n\nHow would you know that this box was accurate?\n\
    \nWell, you\u2019d have to test it. You would construct a set of comprehensive\
    \ experiments by which you could validate the veracity of the output.\n\nLike\
    \ the above, in this case: such a new method of validation would itself become\
    \ a scientific method of validation as its veracity would be scientifically confirmed.\n\
    \nThis demonstrates the true reason why the scientific method is the ultimate\
    \ way of discerning truth: even if it wasn\u2019t, any better method of discerning\
    \ truth that could be discovered would necessarily be subsumed into science -\
    \ and become part of the scientific method.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n- Science can\
    \ discern any truth that is objectively determinable through comparison to reality.\n\
    - Any truth that is not objectively determinable through comparison to reality\
    \ is by definition unknowable and cannot be discerned.\n- Any conceivable method\
    \ of producing truths needs to be validated scientifically and would therefore\
    \ necessarily be a scientific method of discerning truth.\n- Any conceivable method\
    \ of validating truths needs to be confirmed scientifically and would therefore\
    \ necessarily end up being a scientific method of validating truth.\n\nIn essence:\
    \ any method of discerning truth must be validated as accurate before accepted:\
    \ if it can be validated as accurate - it would be subsumed into the scientific\
    \ method. Hence science can be thought of as every objective way of verifiably\
    \ discerning truth that has ever been or will ever be discovered - and contains\
    \ any possible verifiable method that could conceivably exist. Therefore, almost\
    \ by design - science is the ultimate process.\n"

    You seem to be conflating "that which is observed" with "reality".


    > Nothing in science is predicated solely on the involvement of humans.


    You seem to be misrepresenting my point. Whether it is a machine or a human or
    even an extraterrestrial doing the induction it is still reliant on induction.
    I never meant to imply that only humans can do science, only that it is limited
    (for humans) by what humans can observe and then postulate as an explanation of
    what is observed.

    \ the scientific method. At this point it would become part of that same scientific\
    \ method. This is what half of my opening argument was setup to show.\n\n**Summary:**\n\
    \nMy argument hinges around multiple points which my opponent never addresses\
    \ or even acknowledges.\n\n**1.) Discerning truth requires Empiricism**\n\nTo\
    \ discern whether something is true or false, any method must compare the claim\
    \ against reality - this is by definition as truth requires comparison to reality.\
    \ We must show a claim is concordant with reality - and the only method we have\
    \ for that, is by observing reality: Science.\n\nTherefore by definition, science\
    \ and Empiricism are the only method that is available - thus the ultimate method.\
    \ My opponent has **dropped** this argument.\n\n**2.) Science subsumes improvements**\n\
    \nAs outlined in my first round; I showed that any possible theoretical method\
    \ of either generating truth or validating truth would need to be empirically\
    \ validated to ensure its veracity and fidelity. This would be done using science\
    \ - and would subsequently render using this theoretical method part of the scientific\
    \ method.\n\nAs a result, while science as a tool can improve - the process will\
    \ ultimately incorporate any and all possible improvements that could be possibly\
    \ be made.\n\nHence science is the ultimate method. This was **dropped** by my\
    \ opponent.\n\n**3.) Not all truth is knowable**\n\nMy opponents main argument\
    \ makes the assumption that all truths are knowable. He treats the true nature\
    \ of reality, or \u201Cwhat\u201D things are as facts that can be known and revealed.\n\
    \nAs the only validatable method we have of understanding reality is through observation\
    \ - if this cannot reveal a truth, that truth is unknowable.\n\nMy opponent **drops**\
    \ this too.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI have clearly demonstrated why Science is the\
    \ ultimate method. My opponent has largely ignored the broad philosophical and\
    \ epistemological issues I have raised, and has failed to even acknowledge the\
    \ core premise of my argument.\n\nI have clearly shown from first principles that\
    \ the scientific method is the ultimate method, and the privacy of science lies\
    \ in its ability to self improve, together with being able to validate and subsume\
    \ any potential new method or process that works.\n"

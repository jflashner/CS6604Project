  content: 'Premise 1 == Evolutionary cues.


    Biology gives us cues that do lots of things. They tell us when to eat, sleep,
    make waste, etc. These cues also tell us when something feel moral or immoral.


    While people have differing opinions about how we interpret these cues, the cues
    themselves are objective.


    Premise 2 == Source of Morality.


    When people speak of morality, they use slightly different definitions. But the
    two main ones are A) somebody''s opinion or B) a general attitude of society.


    The latter seems to be the more logical one, but are these mere opinions. No.
    These norms that we form all come from our evolutionary cues. This is why we can
    find examples of morals that are almost universal in every society.


    More amazing still, evolution also explains why some people believe different
    things via gene mutation.


    So I think the proper source of morality is evolution.


    Conclusion == Since the cues are objective and morality comes from our cues, that
    mean morality is objective.


    I guess my work here is done.


    Good debate :)


    I kid.


    I will now open my opponent up for his opening statement. Please refrain from
    rebutting my R1 until next round and try to just make your case apart from me
    until then.

    There are no biological morality cues. It is important to know the difference
    between morality, ethics and compassion. Compassion is the closest thing to having
    direct biological cues, but they are not universal. Ethics is the philosophy of
    what is right and wrong in a humane-specific sense and morality (the most arbitrary
    and least objective of all three) is not necessarily rooted in being humane or
    compassionate but also deals with things which are entirely opinion/social construct
    based such as whether or not being gay is a sin. Things such as empathy and the
    capacity to form moral values are rooted in human biology but morality in and
    of itself is not inherent to any organism, and even if it was that doesn''t make
    it objective because there are plenty of organisms for which that is not the case.


    > While people have differing opinions about how we interpret these cues, the
    cues themselves are objective.


    The cues are not "objective" other than that they objectively exist, they not
    only have different interpretations but there are also different cues for different
    people.


    > When people speak of morality, they use slightly different definitions.

    Morality is both of those things. Your moral values are both shaped by your own
    dispositions and the values imprinted on you by culture and experience. If morality
    is universal and objective why do ideas of what is moral differ so much between
    cultures and individuals? It seems like an entirely subjective and socially constructed
    phenomena to me.


    > This is why we can find examples of morals that are almost universal in every
    society.


    You can find entirely opposite morals just as often. Also, it is objective that
    if I stab you it will hurt you, and since humans are biologically equipped with
    empathy they often are opposed to needlessly hurting others. That doesn''t mean
    that people tending to incorporate the "no stabbing rule" into their moral systems
    suddenly makes it an objective fact that it''s "wrong" to stab people. The laws
    of physics don''t care if you stab people, plenty of other organisms don''t care
    either, in what way do human values and feelings of empathy make something a fact?


    > More amazing still, evolution also explains why some people believe different
    things via gene mutation.


    Even if that was true (which you haven''t provided any proof of) that would not
    prove anything other than that the gene mutations objectively exist, not that
    the values and beliefs derived from them are objectively true and valid. What
    if there was a species who''s gene mutations tell them it is objectively moral
    to eat humans?

    I never said the cues we''re universal. The topic isn''t "morality is universal"
    The topic is "morality is objective". That means it only need be true apart from
    my opinion. Universal just means everybody arrives at the same conclusion.(which
    they could do subjectively or objectively) Morality is generally equated with
    the harm or well being of a group or society. Humans are group animals. Therefore
    some of our evolutionary cues promote group behavior.


    People might make subjective decisions based off the cues. But they can also make
    objective decisions based off cues once we understand why we''re receiving them.


    Lets take murder for example. I could murder someone and my cue would go off but
    I could ignore it. However, the fact that I received a cue is objective and it
    was possible for me to properly interpret the cue and not murder them had I thought
    about it objectively beforehand.


    > The cues are not "objective" other than that they objectively exist, they not
    only have different interpretations but there are also different cues for different
    people


    Correct. That''s exactly what I''m saying. The cue objectively exist. It objectively
    tells us one thing "harm/benefit on a group level or individual level depending
    on the cue" and the fact that not everybody has the cue doesn''t matter. All that
    means is that genes give us our morality randomly and then natural selection rewards
    the ones who have the best morality in terms of survival.


    > Morality is both of those things. Your moral values are both shaped by your

    morality is universal and objective why do ideas of what is moral differ so much
    between cultures and individuals? It seems like an entirely subjective and socially
    constructed phenomena to me.


    That''s an equivocation fallacy, while those things might share the same name,
    epistemologically speaking, they count as different words because their definitions
    don''t match. Anybody can have an opinion and name it morality. If that was the
    only standard, then we wouldn''t see moral trends in society the way we do. The
    fact is that while we might make subjective decisions, we''re making them off
    an objective source and we can think objectively about that source and get objective
    judgements which is why murder and rape are illegal in most places on earth.

    That''s not true, you cannot find them "just" as often. For every person who supports
    murder, there are 1,000 that don''t. That''s a disparity and it''s caused by natural
    selection because the one person is interpreting their morals subjectively while
    the others are acknowledging the objective assessment that society has made over
    the centuries based on evolutionary cues.

    I did provide proof. Random gene mutation. What does random mean? It means we
    don''t know the outcome. That means no matter how many non murders survive from
    natural selection, there''s always a chance of random mutations introducing another
    murder, who will then be suppressed by natural selection. That seems to explain
    it quite well in my opinion. Furthermore there is no competing explanation and
    there is nothing that my explanation doesn''t account for.

    There is a difference between feelings/instinctive reactions and morality. "Negative
    cues" are not morality, you don''t need a contrived system of morality to feel
    bad about something.


    > This does not speak to the source of the morality.


    You are conflating the source of morality (human social awareness and the instinctive
    reactions to the suffering/death of others) with the socially constructed systems
    of morality that humans make up.

    The cues that people derive their morality from are not morality, and the cues
    are not universal. There is no "wrong" morality, because the cues you are talking
    about are contrived from human biology and do not correlate to any objective truth
    other than the mere fact that we experience them due to our biology. Furthermore
    the cues themselves are often fabricated by society, and people are literally
    programmed by the generally accepted moral system of their culture to feel a certain
    way about things.

    and then we''ll answer them in R5


    01. You do realize that universal and objective are two different things right?


    02. You claim that the place we derive our morality is not the same as our morality,
    if it''s the source of our morality and that source is objective, then how is
    morality also not objective?


    03. You say that source of morality is different than the social constructs of
    morality, if one is objective and the other is a social construct, then how is
    the second one morality and how is the first one not?


    04. Do you think evolution is accurate?


    05. Since gene mutations are random, wouldn''t it then follow that if morality
    came from gene mutations, that they would not be universal?


    06. If natural selection favors survival behaviors, wouldn''t it then follow that
    if morality came from gene mutations, that natural selection would make the best
    gene mutations for morality the most popular in our species?


    07. Since morality is not universal and the majority of people have similar morality,
    doesn''t it then follow that this seems to fit in with evolution?


    08. Since words are merely defined by usage and we don''t have a unified definition,
    wouldn''t it then follow that we should define morality based off what all the
    definitions seem to point to?


    09. Since that definition seems to point toward harm/benefit and evolution seems
    to also favor this behavior, wouldn''t it then follow that evolution can account
    for this behavior?


    10. If evolution can account for this behavior and there is no other things that
    can account for this behavior, wouldn''t it then follow that evolution seems to
    be the most likely candidate for our moral?

    and notions of a certain type of organism be an objective truth?


    Normally, it can''t, unless it gets lucky and happens to also be objective. But
    this is conflation, You''re confusing the source of morality with moral judgements.
    Moral judgements can be subjective or objective depending on the method the person
    uses. Objective morals are those that come from evolutionary dispositions to promote
    group behavior. If we use this as our standard without inserting our opinion,
    then we get objective moral judgements. If we add our feelings into the mix, then
    it''s subjective.


    Regardless of what people choose to believe, the moral cues we receive from evolution
    are not influenced by our opinion, and therefore, they are necessarily objective.
    Just because people sometimes make subjective assessments based off of this doesn''t
    change what the cues told us.


    > 2: If everyone believes in a certain religion, does that make that religion
    objectively true?


    No, but any decision they make based off that religion is objectively religious
    or non religious, just like any decision based off the cue can be objectively
    moral or immoral\

    Also, everyone not believing doesn''t make the religion objectively false either.


    > 3: If our genes have adapted through natural selection to believe in a flying
    booger sausage with googly eyes that shoots fireballs out of it''s backside and
    this is an optimal survival strategy does that mean it is real?


    no for so many reasons. First of all, you say those are optimal, but that doesn''t
    make it so.


    Second, evolution doesn''t make things optimal, it just favors certain mutations.


    Third, just because a gene combination is possible doesn''t mean it''s going to
    happen, especially if one of those steps of development leave it at a survival
    disadvantage.(your silly booger sausage might seem formidable when finished, but
    in the early stages, it would be quite weak.)


    Fourth, Most of what you named there would be biologically impossible anyway,
    so your example is incoherent.


    In closing. Evolution is the cause of morals and the result is objective moral
    cues. Are they intrinsically or absolutely right or wrong? No. But they are the
    reason that we make moral decisions regardless of if we choose to interpret it
    the same way.


    The key thing here is that this explanation is better than opinions, which wouldn''t
    create the majority that we have in moral judgements, and we can''t say absolute
    or universal because people don''t listen universally.


    But evolution is neither of these things. Evolution produces majorities through
    natural selection and explains like of universality through random gene mutations.
    In short, the model fits and nothing is missing.

    Yes, but what is objectively true is universally true even if it wasn''t always

    exists even though there aren''t rocks on other sidewalks. But the existence of
    the rock of morality depends on what sidewalk you are on, and whether or not you
    trip over it depends on societies opinion of where it is located.

    No. There are no specific gene mutations for morality, only mutations that make
    you more or less susceptible to certain moral ideas. The rest comes down to environment/experience
    based conditioning and the morality you are taught.

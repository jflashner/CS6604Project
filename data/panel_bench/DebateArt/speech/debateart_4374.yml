  content: "**Preamble:**\\\nAbbreviations\\\nBoP = Burden of Proof\\\nSG = Squid\
    \ Game\\\nSK = South Korea\n\nBoP\\\nThe BoP in this debate is shared. I must\
    \ show that SG does not accurately represent capitalism in SK, and CON must show\
    \ that it does. To avoid the [fallacy of composition](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Fallacy-of-Composition),\
    \ a valid representation of capitalism must accurately represent it in all aspects,\
    \ not just in some. Note that dogs have legs, but a drawing of a leg is not an\
    \ accurate representation of a dog.\n\nMy Case\\\nSK has a mixed economy. Therefore,\
    \ I will focus solely on the capitalist aspects\u2014that is, forms of voluntary\
    \ exchange of goods and services that are legal. The distinctions between the\
    \ competitions in SG and capitalism in SK make it clear that one is not an accurate\
    \ representation of the other.\n\n**1. Legal vs. Illegal:**\\\nOverview\n\n- **P1:**\
    \ Illegal activities are categorically different from legal activities.\n- **P2:**\
    \ The competitions in SG are illegal.\n- **P3:** The capitalist components of\
    \ SK\u2019s economic system are legal.\n- **C1:** Therefore, the competitions\
    \ in SG do not accurately represent capitalism in SK.\n\nP1\\\nIllegal activities\
    \ are those deemed by the state as too immoral or dangerous to be allowed. Legal\
    \ agreements are the exact opposite.\n\nP2\\\nThe illegality of the competitions\
    \ in Squid Game is a central point of the show. The competitions would [not qualify\
    \ as euthanasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_euthanasia#:~:text=Patients%20who%20qualify%20for%20active,death%20may%20not%20be%20qualified)\
    \ under South Korean law and would therefore be treated as murder in court. Furthermore,\
    \ the contract signed by participants is too vague, misleading, and [unconscionable](https://academic.oup.com/book/44518/chapter-abstract/376542198?redirectedFrom=fulltext)\
    \ to be enforced.\n\nP3\\\nSee definition of capitalism in the description.\n\n\
    **2. Risk of Death:**\\\nOverview\n\n- **P1:** Unsafe activities are categorically\
    \ different from safe activities.\n- **P2:** Competitions in SG result in a much\
    \ higher chance of death than capitalism in SK.\n- **C1:** Therefore, the competitions\
    \ in SG do not accurately represent capitalism in SK.\n\nP1\\\nFairly self-evident.\n\
    \nP2\\\nOf the 456 players who joined SG, 440 of them [died in the games](https://www.distractify.com/p/squid-game-death-count).\
    \ That\u2019s more than 96%. In 2021, [2,080](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1221800/south-korea-number-of-industrial-accident-deaths/)\
    \ of [25 million](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1124769/south-korea-number-of-workers/#:~:text=As%20of%202021%2C%20there%20were,million%20workers%20in%20South%20Korea)\
    \ workers in SK died from workplace-related accidents. That equates to 0.00832%.\n\
    \n**3. Creation of Value:**\\\nOverview\n\n- **P1:** A system that does not produce\
    \ essential goods and services is not an accurate representation of a system that\
    \ does.\n- **P2:** Competitions in SG do not result in the creation of essential\
    \ goods and services.\n- **P3:** Capitalism in SK results in the creation of essential\
    \ goods and services.\n- **C1:** Therefore, the competitions in SG do not accurately\
    \ represent capitalism in SK.\n\nP1\\\nFairly self-evident.\n\nP2\\\nThe only\
    \ thing produced by the competitions in SG is entertainment for a select few.\
    \ No essential goods or services are produced in exchange for the money given.\n\
    \nP3\\\nIn addition to entertainment, capitalism in SK also produces many essential\
    \ goods and services. Essential goods and services produced by capitalism in SK:\n\
    \n- Bread\n- Clothing\n- A significant portion of healthcare\n- BTS\n\nFor reference,\
    \ [socialism](https://img.ifunny.co/images/49e423bfe943aa29582932517975d3c5557ff27a742db2e4d1bd23762a7d6985_1.webp)\
    \ does a lot worse.\n\n**4. Opportunities for Social Mobility:**\\\nOverview\n\
    \n- **P1:** A system that offers few opportunities for social mobility is not\
    \ an accurate representation of a system that offers many opportunities for social\
    \ mobility.\n- **P2:** The competitions in SG offer few opportunities for social\
    \ mobility.\n- **P3:** Capitalism in SK offers many opportunities for social mobility.\n\
    - **C1:** Therefore, the competitions in SG do not accurately represent capitalism\
    \ in SK.\n\nP1\\\nFairly self-evident.\n\nP2\\\nEveryone is stuck playing the\
    \ games, until the ending when one winner survives and wins the jackpot.\n\nP3\\\
    \nIn SK, people who choose to go into profitable fields can make well above average:\n\
    \n- A computer scientist in SK makes an an average annual salary of [\u20A996,403,336](https://www.salaryexpert.com/salary/job/computer-scientist/south-korea/seoul),\
    \ or $73,101.\n- A petroleum engineer in SK makes an average annual salary of\
    \ [\u20A9109,630,551](https://www.salaryexpert.com/salary/job/petroleum-engineer/south-korea),\
    \ or $83,131.\n- A biomedical engineer in SK makes an average annual salary of\
    \ [\u20A972,468,962](https://www.salaryexpert.com/salary/job/biomedical-engineer/south-korea),\
    \ or $54,915.\n\n**5. Transparency of Risks and Rewards:**\\\nOverview\n\n- **P1:**\
    \ A system with generally unclear risks and rewards in mutual agreements is not\
    \ an accurate representation of a system that is generally transparent about both\
    \ of those things.\n- **P2:** SG is generally unclear about the risks and rewards\
    \ of its competitions.\n- **P3:** Capitalism in SK is generally transparent about\
    \ the risks and rewards of transactions.\n- **C1:** Therefore, the competitions\
    \ in SG do not accurately represent capitalism in SK.\n\nP1\\\nFairly self-evident.\n\
    \nP2\\\nIn the first game, the contract shown is extremely vague and does not\
    \ tell players they will be killed. Later on, it is implied that multiple players\
    \ can survive, although the intention is clearly to kill everyone except the final\
    \ winner.\n\nP3\\\nIn the vast majority of jobs, workers in SK can quit at any\
    \ time, so tricking someone into accepting a dangerous job is hardly tenable.\
    \ The riskiest jobs are those offered by the government, such as military positions,\
    \ which hardly count as unfettered capitalism, especially with the draft. Any\
    \ job with considerable risks would need to be clear upfront about potential risks\
    \ and rewards. Otherwise, the employer could be sued.\n"

    \ a valid representation of capitalism must accurately represent it in all aspects,\
    \ not just in some.\n\nI **respectfully disagree.** If I prove that the representation\
    \ is at least significant enough to warrant a valid comparison, or prove that\
    \ it represents capitalism in most of its aspects, I believe I win this.\n\nSecondly,\
    \ the definition of Capitalism in the debate makes Con unable to argue their side.\n\
    \n> capitalism - A system in which the voluntary exchange of goods and services\

    \ not always legal, but such laws are rarely enforced. So I suggest changing it\

    \ for profit.\u201D\\\n(Oxford Languages.)\n\n**l. The Gladiator Games**\\\nIn\
    \ South Korea.:\\\nIt\u2019s pretty common practice for certain wealthy elites\
    \ to invest or fund in startup companies, and then invest in competitors to watch\
    \ the new entrepreneurs clash.\n\nThen whenever one of the companies is put out\
    \ of business, the elites come in and seize all the profits that remain. Sometimes\
    \ this is done for greed, but a lot of the time, it\u2019s purely for entertainment.\n\
    \n**ll. Squid Game is based on a real life story.**\n\n> **A**ll but the youngest\
    \ Koreans will recognize this lightly fictionalized reference to a labor confrontation\
    \ seared in the country\u2019s memory. In 2009, the carmaker Ssangyong (\u201C\
    Twin Dragon\u201D) Motors pleaded poverty and laid off 2,646 employees at its\
    \ headquarters plant in Pyeongtaek, a city south of Seoul. In response, nearly\
    \ a thousand employees went on strike, some for as long as 77 days, occupying\
    \ the factory site and facing a violent assault by Pinkerton-style security forces\
    \ and Korean police. For years afterward, the surviving workers sought reinstatement\
    \ and compensation in the courts, and 30 employees and several of their spouses\
    \ died, mostly by suicide.\n\n<https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/squid-game-review/>\n"

  content: "**Framework:**\\\nBoP\\\nNote that CON agreed to this debate with clear\
    \ definitions set in the description. CON could have requested alternate definitions\
    \ in the comments or via private chat beforehand but did not. These definitions\
    \ are not \u201Csuggested\u201D. The description specifically states that they\
    \ are to be used in this debate.\n\nPer DebateArt voting policies, [definitions\
    \ favorable to one side](https://info.debateart.com/terms-of-service/voting-policy)\
    \ are not grounds for violating the description, especially when the contender\
    \ fails to request alternate definitions beforehand. These definitions aren't\
    \ unfair, but even if they were, they would not be grounds for using alternate\
    \ definitions.\n\nThese definitions don't hold CON to an impossible standard.\
    \ We both agree that SG does not accurately represent capitalism overall, but\
    \ this opinion is [not universal](https://nypost.com/2021/11/20/real-squid-game-of-south-korea-debt-shame-social-pressure/).\
    \ Many people would've accepted the debate with my definitions, or requested alternate\
    \ ones beforehand. But CON decided he was better suited to accept this debate\
    \ than any of them. Because of that decision, we\u2019ll spend half of this debate\
    \ arguing over something that could have easily been resolved in the comments.\n\
    \nHigh-ranking debaters have created debates with resolutions very favorable to\
    \ them with definitions that are very one-sided. Oromagi has debated against the\
    \ [existence of Bigfoot](https://www.debateart.com/debates/1582-bigfoots-are-bullshit)\
    \ multiple times. CON could try to twist the given definitions to support his\
    \ side or argue that illegal activities can be accurate representations of legal\
    \ activities. The point isn\u2019t that these are good arguments. If I thought\
    \ they were good arguments, I would be arguing for the other side. But these arguments\
    \ _can be made_, and that is the position CON agreed to by accepting this debate.\
    \ While some rules for Kritiks are left vague, favorable definitions are clearly\
    \ not considered harmful enough to the spirit of debate for a Kritik to be \u201C\
    necessary,\u201D per DebateArt rules. Plus, these definitions _don\u2019t explicitly\
    \ give the win to one side_, like defining capitalism as \u201CA system not represented\
    \ by SG.\u201D\n\nMany socialists have used SG as an analogy for laws allowing\
    \ capitalist behavior, so it\u2019s not an uncommon opinion that one is an accurate\
    \ representation of the other. Trying to switch that argument to another, such\
    \ as saying that capitalism is slightly similar to SG, is a clear [motte and bailey](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Motte_and_bailey)\
    \ fallacy. I\u2019m not strawmanning, I\u2019m holding socialists to a standard\
    \ that many of them have set themselves. This debate was intended for someone\
    \ willing to defend that argument.\n\nDefamation Standard\\\nAn accurate _representation_\
    \ as I defined it doesn\u2019t mean one where every detail is exact. It\u2019\
    s one that is not false or misleading, that doesn\u2019t leave out major components\
    \ or \u201Cmisrepresent\u201D the comparison. Writing a movie implying that Obama\
    \ is a serial killer is defamation. Writing one where he wears a polka-dotted\
    \ t-shirt is not. One is clearly misleading in its equivalence to Obama, the other\
    \ is not. The question we should ask is if a book implying that Jeff Bezos or\
    \ some other CEO was secretly running SG could result in a defamation lawsuit\
    \ for misrepresenting them.\n\n**Arguments 1-5:**\\\nCON dropped all these.\n\n\
    **Rebuttals:**\\\n\u201CI respectfully disagree.\u201D\\\nCON disagrees, believing\
    \ that a drawing of a leg is an accurate representation of a dog.\n\n\u201CIf\
    \ I prove that the representation is at least significant enough to warrant a\
    \ valid comparison, or prove that it represents capitalism in most of its aspects,\
    \ I believe I win this.\u201D\\\nThis does not follow from CON\u2019s definition\
    \ of the word accurate, which holds him to a much stricter standard of \u201C\
    deviating only slightly\u201D. CON believes his definition of \u201Caccurate\u201D\
    \ is superior to the one in the description he agreed to, because his comes from\
    \ a dictionary. Unfortunately for CON, [my definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/accurate#:~:text=%3A%20free%20from%20error%20especially%20as,providing%20accurate%20color)\
    \ comes from a more esteemed dictionary. Oxford, another esteemed dictionary,\
    \ [defines accurate](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/accurate#:~:text=1correct%20and%20true%20in,Accurate%20records%20must%20be%20kept)\
    \ as \u201Ccorrect and true in every detail,\u201D and CON seems to like Oxford\u2019\
    s definition of capitalism. So I think CON is harming their case by making these\
    \ kinds of Kritiks.\n\n\u201Csuch laws are rarely enforced\u201D\\\nCitation needed.\
    \ How prevalent are orchestrated deathmatches in SK? Certainly nowhere near as\
    \ prevalent as in SG. Like the comparisons that follow, this doesn\u2019t even\
    \ meet CON\u2019s own definition of the word \u201Caccurate\u201D.\n\n\u201CThe\
    \ Gladiator Games\u201D\n\n- CON doesn\u2019t provide a source for this, so there\u2019\
    s no measure of scale here.\n- These do not result in death, let alone a 96% death\
    \ rate.\n- Might be a net gain; funding for startups leaves entrepreneurs with\
    \ more experience.\n\n\u201Cbased on a real life story\u201D\\\nSo was [Nightmare\
    \ on Elm Street](https://screenrant.com/movies-based-on-real-true-stories/). Sometimes\
    \ directors take creative liberties. The only similarity here is that both SG\
    \ and this event lead to death. But there are two problems here. First, dying\
    \ because the police try to stop you from trespassing is not the same as competing\
    \ in a death match with coercive unclear rules. You can say they\u2019re both\
    \ wrong (I think one is significantly less wrong), but even then, it\u2019s like\
    \ saying that murder is wrong and rape is wrong, therefore murder is an accurate\
    \ representation of rape. Second, firing employees does not become morally equivalent\
    \ to SG just because the employees commit suicide. CON is relying on the premise\
    \ that if something you do causes someone to commit suicide, it\u2019s well represented\
    \ by SG. This is a classic example of [proving too much](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/G5eMM3Wp3hbCuKKPE/proving-too-much),\
    \ since clearly making someone sad does not become morally equivalent to SG just\
    \ because that person commits suicide. Pretty much anything could become morally\
    \ equivalent to SG by that standard. CON can say that I\u2019m strawmanning him\
    \ and that he doesn\u2019t believe that premise, but then how does he think that\
    \ suicide and SG are morally comparable?\n\nOverall comparison to capitalism\\\
    \nSG has a 96% death rate. Capitalism in SK has a death rate of approximately\
    \ 0.00832%, as I showed in my opening. The anecdotal example CON gave does little\
    \ to change this. Given the five major differences I showed between the competitions\
    \ in SG and capitalism in SK, the comparison between the two does not \u201Cdeviate\
    \ only slightly\u201D as CON claims.\n"

  content: "My opponent has dropped most of the points from my earlier round and gone\
    \ on to establish an entirely new framework. This is extremely significant per\
    \ DebateArt standards. Whether or not you agree with my arguments challenging\
    \ CON\u2019s Kritik, as well as the other arguments that they have dropped, the\
    \ fact that CON has not challenged them means they **effectively stand uncontested**.\
    \ CON could of course bring up objections to these points in his final round,\
    \ but DebateArt policy holds that arguments [intentionally withheld until the\
    \ final round should be dismissed](https://info.debateart.com/terms-of-service/voting-policy).\
    \ Normally I\u2019d just sum up the points that were given in the debate so far,\
    \ but because CON has essentially made an entirely new argument, I\u2019ll be\
    \ sporting and respond to it.\n\n**Points that CON has dropped (effectively conceded):**\n\
    \n- My criticism of their Kritik and alternative definitions\n- CON committed\
    \ the fallacy of composition and did not challenge the dog/leg analogy, even when\
    \ I pointed out in Round 2 that they had missed it.\n- Per the above, an analogy\
    \ for capitalism that ignores the benefits (their new framework certainly does)\
    \ or gets a major component wrong is not an accurate representation of capitalism.\n\
    - The defamation standard holds that serious discrepancies are effectively misrepresentations.\n\
    - I\u2019ve been spelling these points out for the entire debate. CON has either\
    \ failed to challenge these points or is withholding their response until the\
    \ final round; in either case, we should consider these points dropped.\n- Even\
    \ if we count black markets per my opponent\u2019s alternate definition of capitalism\
    \ (which would exist under socialism as well), the risk of death under capitalism\
    \ in SK, generally speaking, is much less than in SG. As I rhetorically pointed\
    \ out, \u201CHow prevalent are orchestrated deathmatches in SK?\u201D CON did\
    \ not respond to this point, because the answer does not make their argument look\
    \ good. Obviously, the vast majority of capitalism in SK fits into my initial\
    \ points (legal, low risk, transparency)\n- The other two (opportunities and value)\
    \ don\u2019t depend on the majority of capitalism providing them, just that there\
    \ are a lot of opportunities and value generated by capitalism as a whole. So\
    \ adding black markets to the definition of capitalism doesn\u2019t negate those\
    \ points either.\n- Essentially, the five points I made in my opening _remain\
    \ uncontested_ and show serious discrepancies that prove SG is not an accurate\
    \ representation of capitalism.\n\n**Rebuttals:**\\\n\u201CThe deaths in Squid\u2019\
    s Game are metaphorical and the contestants serve as stand-ins for the businesses\
    \ that compete.\u201D & \u201CDeaths in SG = Failed Businesses in SK\u201D\\\n\
    First of all, a 13.5% drop is nowhere near 96%, but that\u2019s not even the biggest\
    \ problem with this analogy. Just because people stopped working at a self-owned\
    \ business does not mean that business was a \u201Cfailure\u201D. They eventually\
    \ picked another line of work, but they still made a living off of that business\
    \ for a good chunk of time. If someone no longer works in fast food, that does\
    \ not mean their time in fast food was a \u201Cfailure,\u201D nor that it is accurately\
    \ represented by someone who is shot in the head in SG.\n\nAlso, not an accurate\
    \ representation in the slightest. When businesses go bankrupt, the business owners\
    \ are not systematically executed. If we\u2019re willing to stretch things that\
    \ much, then anything could be a representation of anything else. Just saying\
    \ \u201Cx represents y\u201D does not make it an _accurate_ representation.\n\n\
    \u201CRigged Game\u201D\\\nThese top companies are not systematically murdering\
    \ their competitors to keep them in line. Their power is also not absolute. If\
    \ a new company comes along with a product and consumers buy it, these companies\
    \ do not have the authority to stop those transactions. In SG, every aspect of\
    \ the games is _directly_ controlled by a few people. Anyone who steps out of\
    \ line can be killed.\n\n\u201CGreed & Vanity\u201D\\\nI\u2019ll grant that people\
    \ in SK and in SG both want money to buy things, but people want money in pretty\
    \ much every economic system, so this is a pretty insignificant point. As I\u2019\
    ve stated in both previous rounds, people in SG are willing to risk an extremely\
    \ high chance of death and kill other people. They don\u2019t know it\u2019s going\
    \ to be a 96% chance of death, but they pretty much get the gist after the first\
    \ game. Capitalism, in contrast, involves cooperation to develop new products\
    \ and provide essential services. The chance of death from capitalism is extremely\
    \ minimal; in fact, the essential services produced save lives. They are [not\
    \ the same](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-are-not-the-same).\n\n_And even\
    \ if we ignore all that_, my opponent\u2019s analogy further misrepresents capitalism\n\
    \n- Consumers decide which businesses succeed and which ones fail based on the\
    \ _usefulness of services provided_, not based on arbitrary rules set by more\
    \ powerful businesses\u2014if everyone buys from a smaller business, there\u2019\
    s nothing the chaebol can do.\n- Consumers _benefit_ from competition, because\
    \ the businesses that win are the ones providing products people want. If SG is\
    \ an accurate representation of capitalism, we should see the winner offering\
    \ services or some benefit to the other players.\n- If a business fails in SK,\
    \ the owner can start a new business.\n- If capitalism in SK is a dog, SG isn\u2019\
    t even a picture of a leg. It\u2019s a picture of a tentacle.\n\n**Conclusion:**\\\
    \nCON has listed a few superficial similarities between the competitions in SG\
    \ and capitalism in SK. He has also used examples in SG to _inaccurately_ represent\
    \ business competition in SK. Essentially, my main point remains uncontested.\
    \ SG does not \u201Cdeviate only slightly\u201D from capitalism in SK. So even\
    \ if we use CON\u2019s definitions of accuracy and capitalism (and they\u2019\
    ve stopped arguing that we should), competitions in Squid Game do not accurately\
    \ represent capitalism.\n"

    \nIt would therefore seem Pro is taking too much of a literal interpretation to\
    \ what was intended as a lighthearted critique of a barbaric system.\n\nAs I previously\
    \ stated that was completely overlooked by Pro is that Squid Game uses metaphors\
    \ and symbols to demonstrate its point about South Korea\u2019s Capitalism.\n\n\
    It is a satire which accurately depicts the subtle tyranny and vanity that is\
    \ prevalent in their consumer society. The deaths in Squid Game represent the\
    \ businesses in SK that shut down.\n\n**Rebuttals**\n\n> - CON committed the fallacy\
    \ of composition and did not challenge the dog/leg analogy, even when I pointed\
    \ out in Round 2 that they had missed it.\n> - Per the above, an analogy for capitalism\
    \ that ignores the benefits (their new framework certainly does) or gets a major\
    \ component wrong is not an accurate representation of capitalism.\n> - The defamation\
    \ standard holds that serious discrepancies are effectively misrepresentations.\n\
    \nNo such fallacy was ever made.\n\nThe claim that I believe the dog/leg metaphor\
    \ is a strawman by Pro.\n\nSouth Korean\u2019s capitalism is much more akin to\
    \ a feral animal and Squid Game presents it as Cujo. A pretty valid comparison,\
    \ if you consider everything I spoke of regarding the barbaric competition in\
    \ their version of capitalism.\n\n> - Consumers decide which businesses succeed\

    \nYes. In an _idealistic_ Capitalistic society.\n\nBut as we know is that capitalism\
    \ in South Korea is so far from ideal. If the system worked as intended, none\
    \ of the criticisms raised by Squid Game would be valid.\n\nThe system is rigged\
    \ to the Chaebol\u2019s wants. If the consumers decide to purchase from a competitor,\
    \ the Chaebols will buy out the business or find another way to shut it down,\
    \ effectively limiting the consumers\u2019 options.\n\nIronically, the evil creators\
    \ of the Squid Game are the ones working behind the scenes to create circumstances\
    \ that will ensure the consumers\u2019 desperacy so they can masquerade as an\
    \ angel of light and present them with the Golden Opportunity.\n\nHow did Darth\
    \ Sidious turn Anakin to the Dark Side, do you think?\n\n**Extend** that Squid\
    \ Game was also based on a real historical event.\\\nExtend contention about the\
    \ Capitalistic Gladiator Games.\n"

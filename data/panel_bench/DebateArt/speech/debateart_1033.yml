    \ hope we both become better debaters and better people through this exchange.\n\
    \nThat said, I will delve into my constructive:\n\n**I negate the Resolved: Violent\
    \ revolution is a just response to political oppression.**\\\nBecause of the inclusion\
    \ of the word \"just\" in the resolution, it forces us to consider whether violence\
    \ is a just response\\\nto oppression. This means that questions of whether violence\
    \ is a moral response must relate to justice or the question of the resolution\
    \ is not answered. As such, any argument my opponent makes fulfilling their Value\
    \ but not the value of justice is invalid, and cannot gain them any ground in\
    \ this debate.\\\nAs such, I observe that whosoever proves that they can effectively\
    \ preserve the integrity and justice of society, without compromising some in\
    \ the process, should win this round. Simultaneously, I also observe that whosoever\
    \ proves that they can provide a moral response in any given situation to political\
    \ oppression should win this round.\\\nAs such, it is the burden of the affirmative\
    \ to prove that violent revolution does not in any way compromise the integrity\
    \ and justice of society, while also proving that violent revolution is a moral\
    \ response in any given situation of political oppression, as the resolution would\
    \ imply.\n\nNow, for better definitions:\\\n**revolution** - a catch all term\
    \ for any effort to overthrow a government. A civil war can be a revolution, as\
    \ can an insurgency, or even a coup. To the extent that there's a real difference\
    \ in how you'd use the term, it's that you say revolution when you want to focus\
    \ on the change in the government itself, rather than just a change in who is\
    \ doing the governing.\\\n**violent revolution -** any revolution in which revolutionaries\
    \ choose to respond to repression with violence.\\\n**justice -** fair and fitting\
    \ treatment.\\\n**political oppression-** Wide, persistent and systematic violation\
    \ of basic human rights or inequalities in political participation.\\\n**My first\
    \ contention is the counter-productivity of violent revolution when working to\
    \ institute justice.**\\\nAs Mattias Iser writes, in \"The Ethics of War: Essays\u201D\
    \\\n\u201CThe possibility of such violent revolution has as a precondition of\
    \ what I have referred to as demonization or a denial that one is fighting humans\
    \ who deserve respect.\u201D Essentially, revolutionary violence breeds a culture\
    \ that undermines the civility and restraint necessary for a political community,\
    \ which undermines the revolutionary goal of achieving a more just and peaceful\
    \ society that, after all, demands virtues of civility and compromise.\n\nLet\
    \ us take our own revolution, or civil conflict, for example: From the beginning\
    \ of the revolutionary period in the 1760s, British supporters were harassed,\
    \ intimidated, and often attacked by Patriot mobs. As war approached in the 1770s,\
    \ the victims of Patriot wrath expanded to include lukewarm supporters and the\
    \ vocally undecided, and the attacks upon them and the damage to their property,\
    \ escalated in severity.\n\nLet us look at the the French revolution, which quickly\
    \ degenerated into a bloodbath.\\\nThe wave of revolutionary passion and widespread\
    \ hysteria quickly swept the countryside. Peasants looted and burned the homes\
    \ of tax collectors, landlords and the elite. Later, a wave of violence resulted\
    \ in massacre if hundreds of accused counterrevolutionaries. Later, it sent King\
    \ Louis the 16th to the guillotine; his wife suffered the same fate. Following\
    \ the king\u2019s execution, a bloody Reign of Terror came in which suspected\
    \ enemies of the revolution were guillotined by the thousands. And worst of all,\
    \ all of this ended with a bloodthirsty tyrant seizing control: Napoleon. The\
    \ entire revolution, built up to nothing but counter-productivity.\n\nLet us look\
    \ at communist revolutions all over the world, where Lenin and his followers promised\
    \ a system that would release the repressed, empower the proletariat against a\
    \ wealthy bourgeoisie and create a land of abundance and social justice. The late\
    \ Rudolph Rummel, the demographer of government mass murder, estimated the human\
    \ toll of twentieth-century socialism to be about 61 million in the Soviet Union,\
    \ 78 million in China, and roughly 200 million worldwide. These victims perished\
    \ during state-organized famines, collectivization, cultural revolutions, purges,\
    \ campaigns against \u201Cunearned\u201D income, and other devilish experiments\
    \ in social engineering. In its monstrosity, this terror is unrivaled in the course\
    \ of human history, all in the name of justice.\n\nHow is it, that we can expect\
    \ violent revolution to give justice, when all it does is reverse the roles of\
    \ who is the oppressed, and who are the oppressors? How is it, that we can call\
    \ such violence \u201Cjust\u201D in all situations, when such violent revolution\
    \ and reversed oppression is clearly avoidable? For this reason in of itself,\
    \ the affirmative must lose this round.\n\nWow, I must say that next debate I\

    However, I would like to address something said by my opponent.


    > As such, it is the burden of the affirmative to prove that violent revolution
    does not in any way compromise the integrity and justice of society, while also
    proving that violent revolution is a moral response in any given situation of
    political oppression, as the resolution would imply.


    **This is not true. It is not my job to prove that violent revolution doesn''t
    compromise the integrity and justice of society because such a resolution was
    not mentioned in either the description nor the title. It is only my job to prove
    that violent revolution is a just response to political oppression.**\

    Political oppression is a tool which is hard to escape from under. Many times,
    in governments like the USSR or Germany before WWII, a secret police was created
    to enforce the law of the land, and political ideologies were enforced through
    physical force and abuse. The problem with this is that the power stays in the
    same place time and time again, and the people have no way to escape from this
    iron fist. That is where violent revolution comes through.


    For example, we can look at the Russian Revolution. Russia had just lost a war
    with Japan, and many people had been conscripted and had died. This trend continued
    many times despite promises made by Tsar Nicholas II to change. Then, in 1917,
    there were two revolutions in February and October to take power away from the
    Tsar. Now, while this did end up in the communist USSR, we still see that the
    violent revolution is what made a change. There literally was no opening for anything
    else, so eventually, the people had to do what they could.


    Now, some people may point to the non-violent protests in America for civil rights
    and evidence that change can occur without violence. However, the problem with
    that is that America is based on a voting system and democracy, and through those
    avenues change could be made. Another important aspect is that there was no secret
    police enforcing the law of the land as directly as some of the societies mentioned
    above. Because of this, political change was relatively easier in America than
    in other societies.


    Another problem is that governments get bolder as no resistance is found. They
    essentially push the limits of their authority; that is simply the nature of greedy
    authoritarian leaders. The oppressed feel this and must do something if they are
    to survive, and hopefully make a change in their society for the better. If they
    are kept from politics and cannot make a change in that area, the only other possible
    option is violent revolution.


    In these cases, violent revolution is just because it is essentially treating
    the government the way they''ve been treating the oppressed. As the only possible
    option, it is justified as a way to free those who are caged in by abused political
    power.\

    **Rebuttal**


    My opponent''s main argument is that because, many times, violent revolution has
    simply reversed the roles of the oppressed that it is not just. However, **in
    the moment**, if violent revolution is the only avenue that seems as if it can
    make some change in the lives of the oppressed, then it is justified. The end
    result after the revolution is irrelevant because all it sheds light on is the
    behavior of the people in the revolution and if they are able to transform their
    society to be better.


    Over to my opponent! :)

    \ Removing all forms of impact from the revolution gives us no means by which\
    \ to determine whether the conflict was a just one.**\n\nIn my personal conversations\
    \ with [Professor and Philosopher David Reidy from the University of Tennessee](https://philosophy.utk.edu/staff/reidy.php),\
    \ he clarifies what we can do to determine whether conflicts are just.\n\nHe writes,\
    \ \u201Cthe use of violence as a means to the end of changing political conditions\
    \ should be in all cases both a last resort, proportional, (which simply means\
    \ the change in political conditions, should exceed the cost of the means used\
    \ to secure it,) and likely to succeed to a sufficient degree, as what would be\
    \ the point of the violence undertaken if it was destined to utterly fail?\u201D\

    \ their claims in constructive.\n\nFirst claim: \"The people have no way to escape\
    \ from the iron fist of tyranny in a non-democratic society.\"\n\nLet us take,\
    \ for example, arguably the most oppressive government in human history: Nazi\
    \ Germany. _(Source 1)_\n\nThe German army was well prepared to meet armed resistance,\
    \ but less able to cope with forms of nonviolent action.\n\nA famous example is\
    \ when the Norwegian teachers were told to join the Nazi party and teach Nazi\
    \ ideology in schools or face the consequences.12,000 teachers signed a declaration\
    \ against the new law, and after some months the order was cancelled and they\
    \ were allowed to continue their work. **We can just imagine what would have been\
    \ the success if many professions had followed in the footsteps of these teachers.**\n\
    \nIn Denmark almost all Jews survived because they were helped by the resistance\
    \ movement to escape to Sweden and avoid the gas chambers.\n\nIn Bulgaria most\
    \ of the country\u2019s 48,000 Jews were saved when people threatened to lie across\
    \ railroad tracks to prevent Jews from being deported.\n\nEven in Germany itself\
    \ people opposed the arrests. In one famous example 6000 \u201DAryan\u201D German\
    \ women took part in a nonviolent protest. Thanks to these brave women 1700 prisoners\
    \ were indeed released.\n\n**Clearly, even under the direst of circumstances,\
    \ nonviolent revolution is severely underestimated by the Affirmative.**\\\nThis\
    \ was not only one of the societies my opponent mentioned, but it is an extreme\
    \ example with the very \"police forces\" and authoritarian leader he mentions.\n\
    \nSecond claim: \"Violent revolution is justified because it is a form of proportional\
    \ justice.\"\n\n**Self-defense is not justified if it devolves into hurting innocents.**\\\
    \n**What cost is the Negative willing to pay for reciprocity?**\n\nLoyalists here\
    \ in America, slaughtered.\\\nKilled without trial or conviction but only accusation,\
    \ from the oppressors to the oppressed just like that. Does that sound proportional?\n\
    \nWe also have the French revolution, bloodbath.\\\nSame as American, but more\

    \ roughly 200 million dead worldwide.\\\nThose were not the oppressors by any\
    \ means, but innocents caught in crossfire. Does that sound proportional?\n\n\
    **If a revolution comes at the cost of innocent life, it is unjust. If a revolution\
    \ comes at the cost of switching the roles of the oppressor and the oppressed,\
    \ it is unjust.**\\\n**Trying to defeat the state with violence is like cutting\

    **Allow me to be clear. Such a resolution was not made clear in either the title
    nor the description. If it had been, I wouldn''t have accepted. It is dishonest
    debating to interpolate a new claim in the middle of an argument.**


    **justice -** fair and fitting treatment.


    This was the definition used for "just" (which is the word used in the title).


    So, essentially, the resolution is that **violent revolution is a fair and fitting
    treatment in response to political oppression.** That means that we are COMPARING
    the two. Whatever happens afterward is completely irrelevant.


    For example, if a judge sentences a murderer to life in jail, that''s fair sentencing
    (in your average murder case and in most places in the US). However, what if that
    sentencing makes the murderer more likely to commit suicide? Well, guess what,
    **the sentencing was still fair**. Perhaps more work would need to be done on
    the system to give those people psychologists whatever, but **in the moment, when
    comparing the action of murdering and the sentencing to life in jail, the resulting
    sentence was fair in comparison to the murder. Whatever happens afterward is irrelevant
    to the question "is it fair and fitting treatment." The same exact argument applies
    to the contention.**


    > Under my opponent''s, I could massacre 700 people because someone pinched my
    arm everyday for a week, and I didn''t deem it feasible to talk to them. I had
    a problem and saw violence as the only means to solve it. Doesn''t mean it''s
    just, does it?


    First of all, pinching is not political oppression. Second of all, I never said
    **every** violent revolution is a just response, and that isn''t the resolution.
    Third, a massacre isn''t a revolution, violent or not.


    **First claim: "T\*\*\*\*he people have no way to escape from the iron fist of
    tyranny in a non-democratic society."**


    Allow me to change this claim. The people have **few ways** to escape from the
    iron fist of tyranny in a non-democratic society."


    Remember that Nazi Germany controlled many of the forms of newspapers, so who
    knows whether the citizens were able to hear about such incidents that my opponent
    mentioned.


    Also, many times non-violent revolutions are met with violence. Such is the case
    many times in slave America, where slaves had no freedom and rarely non-violently
    protest without severe bodily harm.


    Also, I would like to make it clear that I am not contesting the effectiveness
    of non-violent protest. However, just because non-violent protest can be effective
    doesn''t mean that violent revolution isn''t a just response.


    For example, if you''re frequently beaten up at school, and one day you just punch
    the bully in the nose, would that not be just? Many would argue that it is because
    it is fair treatment of what happened to you. Now is it the **most effective**?
    Perhaps not because the bully may become angrier and hit the kid more. Maybe telling
    a teacher or principal would have been **more effective**. However, this debate
    is over whether it is just, not effective.\

    And, remember the resolution is not **is violent revolution the most just response
    to political oppression**, just is it just, or is it the **most effective**. It
    is clear that from atrocious acts like in Nazi Germany, America from Britain,
    and many other places such as Russia and the USSR, they were clearly warranted.
    They organized and worked to overthrow the government and make the countries better
    for their citizens (at least until a communist came into power and undermined
    that goal, but that''s beside the point).


    > **Self-defense is not justified if it devolves into hurting innocents.**\

    > **What cost is the Negative willing to pay for reciprocity?**


    **Again, the debate is not "is it justified"**. It is "**is it a\*\*\*\*just response"**.
    Those are two different things, so this claim is completely irrelevant to the
    debate.

    \ revolution are not the same. Secondly, if violent revolution is a just response\
    \ (which I have shown it is multiple times), then it hurting immigrants does not\
    \ change that fact. That simply means that the methods used were unjust, However,\
    \ violent revolution as a whole can be judged as one; there is no need for an\
    \ individual basis. Because of that, the justness of the methods used is irrelevant.\n\
    \n> **If the loss of innocent life at the hands of revolutionaries is avoidable,\
    \ it would be unjust not to avoid it.**\n\nI completely agree. However, once again,\
    \ it being unjust does not make it an unjust RESPONSE, because that deals relative\
    \ to the political oppression being faced.\n"

  content: 'Haven''t you noticed how dumb people tend to be more brutish in mentality
    until a certain point where it cuts off and then they become high EQ for being
    so dumb? Or how the average feminine brain is less technically able than the average
    masculine brain but more intellectual (5/10) males are often effeminate or nerdy
    and less "macho". There is a yin/yang pattern to brain types. A type 7/10 for
    example is emotionally very yang (masculine) and intellectually very yin (feminine).
    This leads to an explosive, passionate way of reacting to life combined with a
    wavy and eclectic way of processing it which leads to artistic genius when properly
    channeled.


    A type 6/10 is the polar opposite leading to a brain that is good at math but
    mirrors type 1/10 in terms of social skills. The hyper-yin emotions of a type
    6 paired with the rigid way they think often leaves them less equipped to deal
    with life than a type 7. They don''t necessarily have hyper-stereotypically-female
    emotions though, they are often "dull" emotionally. Yin/yang don''t perfectly
    correlate to masculine and feminine in the stereotypical sense and the emotional
    side of things more broadly deals with how they react to the world and their own
    thoughts. The intellectual side is how they process rather than how they react,
    but both ultimately comprise and determine the type.


    This theory has no direct support since it''s my theory but I will try to muster
    sources that support it in the next round.

    Pro has not given any sources on anything. Looking at his R1 argument, it appears
    that the only 10-category assignment is the one Pro wrote in the description.


    There is one problem.


    > 4/10: This type is a more sophisticated type 2


    Type 4 is, in Pro''s own words, a proper subset of type 2. This means that type
    4 and the other classifications are not on the same level. On the primary level
    which includes the other classifications, there appears to be nine; and if we
    count sub-classes, who are we to say that there aren''t distinct subclasses under
    the other types as well! Due to Pro not stating said subclasses, we cannot conclude
    that there are only 10 types of people here. The topic literally cannot be proven
    as of this point.


    **tldr: Pro''s description for type 4 has singlehandedly undermined the validity
    of his framework in respect to the actual topic.**

    yang leaning type.


    Con''s argument was almost equivalent to a forfeit. He doesn''t understand the
    types, he was just looking for a cheap excuse to say "I win".


    I am going to either wait until the next round or not even bother with sources
    since I''m a lazy son of a bitch and it is difficult to find good relevant sources
    for this.

    Pro has not given the source for this, nor has Pro specified exactly this before.
    This is what Pro said in the description:

    Nothing more.


    This is moving the goalpost, essentially.

    but more generally capable.

    What appears to be the problem here is bolded. Before stating that the presumptions
    is not fully fledged out, the opposition has otherwise zero ways of knowing this
    and can only assume that the previously-established framework is the complete
    one that will be with the arguments. By merely stating that "I didn''t fully explain",
    the goalpost is both intended to be moved and actually not moved, meaning that
    this statement is unproductive, and basing an entire round on a statement that
    does nothing does nothing.

    Exactly. Basing an entire round on a statement that does nothing does nothing,
    and elaborating on what doesn''t doesn''t anything either.


    Now again, let''s see how ridiculous "I didn''t fully explain" is as a remedial
    attempt.


    > Pro: Abortion should always be illegal.\

    > Con: That is not true, Abortion should be legal when the mother is in danger!\

    > Pro: Except not, because I forgot to state that this topic explicitly excludes
    cases where the mother is in danger!\

    > Con: Oh come on.


    See? It is indeed moving the goalpost.

    First off, irrelevant. We are talking about whether if humans fit in 10 types,
    not what the types are. Well, discussing the latter would have been useful information
    if Pro actually solidified the proof that there are 10 types. Pro has not, basing
    the argument on an incomplete framework and attempting to change it midway, while
    NOT SOURCING it to any study. In all seriousness, we do not know if Pro is making
    this stuff up or not, and Pro has not established this idealized categorization
    with any societal data either.


    Secondly, all additions to the framework in the second and third round are irrelevant,
    due to that the description and the title are all that can be expected and agreed
    upon by anyone who accepts the invitation. Adding anything afterwards would be
    akin to adding conditions on the contract AFTER signing it. Would you be happy
    if your boss changes irreversibly your contract so that it says your monthly pay
    is $1 instead of $1500? Exactly, that is what Pro is doing in essence, just in
    a less socially negative way, but never straying into the positive half of the
    axis.


    All in all, Pro in R2 attempts to introduce things that was not agreed to be a
    part of the deal and thus shall be nullified. All Pro''s R3 attempts are futile.
    The same conclusions at the end of R1 are maintained.


    - Because in the description, Type 4 is specifically stated to be a subset of
    (completely included by) type 2, it is thus false that Pro stated that there are
    10 types of personalities on any given level of analyzation.


    **tl;dr: extend.**

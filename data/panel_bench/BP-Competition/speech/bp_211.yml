    The highest rate of plastic surgery per population in the world, Gangnam Style, is world renowned for what it does. If at the point at which we have to choose whether we want to be an average human being or a celebrity who is complicit in thousands or millions of young girls trying to take diet pills, taking plastic surgery, etc., we would much rather choose the average life. There are going to be three points in this speech. First of all, I'm going to talk about the incentives of media and talent agencies, why that uniquely leads to three impacts: one in terms of your bargaining power and the fact that you lose agency. Secondly, I'm going to talk about mental and physical health, why that's bad, and thirdly, I'm going to talk about complicity before I go on to the comparative. Okay, let's be really clear. What are the incentives of media and talent agencies and what is the framing for this round? How do you get people in Korea? If you want to be a K-pop star, you have to go to agencies like Sully, which start recruiting children as young as seven. What are the incentives to recruit people who are extremely young? First of all, it allows them to construct a backstory, a narrative about you, such that you can sell yourself to the population and be marketable well into the future. Secondly, it also allows them to assess who is talented and who's not, especially considering the K-pop market is really, really saturated and they want the best sort of person. And lastly, it's also about profits making in the long run. If you have somebody for you working for you for 40 years, and you're going to get more profit as opposed to somebody who's working for you for 10 years. This is a process that this person has gone through and come through to get here. What is the problem over here? I want to know two specific problems over here. In all likelihood, on the balance of probability, you got into this really young when you were seven or twelve. First of all, at the point at which you entered this industry, in order for you to be successful, there was no informed choice, no informed consent. At the point at which you did this, your parents made this decision for you and control your life to get through over here. But secondly, I want to note also at the point at which you're already within the talent agency, the talent agency socializes you in terms of your expectations in the future life and what you want to do. So if you want to become a doctor, it becomes really, really difficult for you to get out because you've been socialized and locked into this. This is a huge problem, especially for the second reason over here, which is to say that you have no bargaining power in terms of your agency. So if they want to run stuff like "we want discursive change," we want to, you know, impact the U.N., etc., there are two problems over why you have no control over your life and why it's made me must be weighed very heavily in the round. First of all, in order for you to be successful, here's the kind of shit that you must do: you must lose weight. South Korean beauty standards are extremely conservative. Shermay now wants to be 49 kilograms explicitly because of this sort of shit. Well, you must be extremely, extremely same so that you can attract a very huge chunk of the market. This means, again, weight loss pills, this means plastic surgery, so on and so forth. But also, it is conservative in terms of sexual identities. You cannot be openly gay. They are going to control who you get into a relationship with, who you're not getting in a relationship with, which brand you're endorsing, which brand you're not endorsing. Again, they want you to be straight because if you are straight, you sell well with the population and you're not controversial. The last thing to notice: you have no ability to assert your rights because, again, the market is saturated. Lots of people want to be K-pop stars, which means that you can be replaced at any single point in which they want to replace you, especially because they have like a literal fucking talent pool behind you, which means that there is a loss of agency on their side that necessarily happens. This is the biggest harm for a human being and so far even money is used a panel so that it can give you happiness. But if you have no control over your life, you're not a human being, you're a fucking robot for some talent agency. But secondly, I also want to talk about mental and physical health. First of all, mental health is extremely like, you know, big taboo topic within Korea. That's why lots of people, even celebrities, do not talk about depression, do not talk about lots of other things because they are perceived in the population as weak people, not Korean people who are strong or Asian people who do not have these sorts of values, which is also distinct from why they're distinct from celebrities in the West. I want to note that you cannot have access to mental health for this reason or talk about mental health issues. But secondly, there's intense media scrutiny that doesn't necessarily happen in your life, which is to say that it sells if you can say this, this pop star takes drugs, this has a drug abuse problem, or this pop star goes to this sort of therapy clinic. So you have no privacy over your life. This makes your mental life much worse and you aren't even able to access mental health care in the first place because you're afraid that you will be outed and your profession will, you know, go down. On the comparative, because we do not have this scrutiny on our side, we have much more ability to decide who we want to be with and basically also whether you want to access mental health care or not. So we have much more decision-making power when you be an anonymous Korean person on our side. Before moving on, I'll take CO.

    > POI: How many diet pills do you think sai has taken?

    I don't care about Sai because Sai is the only person who is, uh, the only person on your side of the house. Look at BTS. Look at the whole, fucking, like, if you're really going to say that only side did it, like, fair enough. If you want to go compete on side, go for it. Okay. In terms of mental and physical health, again, this means that you're likely to get plastic surgeries, weight, diet, etc. It exposes you to lots of mental health, uh, and physical health ramifications, especially if you're a kid, right? If you're a kid and you're taking diet pills, if you're a kid and you're exercising more than, I don't know, you're studying or whatever you're doing. I want you to note that this locks you in and it makes your health worse. Also, I want to say another reason why you can't shift professions is specifically because you must focus on this talent as opposed to your education, so you don't diversify your skill set and you're locked in to this sort of, to this sort of, uh, you know, industry. Lastly, on why it is, you know, you are morally complicit in the harms that are true to lots of people, I want to note that South Korea has one of the highest teen suicide rates in the world, and especially female teen suicide rates in the world. This is because the expectations that you create as a person within the industry. And you know, again, on average, you're going to be a very, extremely good looking person, uh, working out, so on and so forth, uh, really white also because there's also a dark white, uh, issue within South Korea. The problem over here is one, you are forcing lots of kids so that they can gain social acceptability to go on the same sorts of, like, toxic routine that you have gone through. So lots of kids have to do that, and in the process, they're also exposed to the mental health harms. But secondly, for people who have no consent or how they look, imagine a kid who is being bullied because they don't look like the person who's at in BTS. So many kids are bullied because of this sort of stuff. So regardless of whether you have fame or money, the fact that unconsenting individuals, mostly kids, are going to be harmed by your actions means that that money does not matter for shit. You're complicit in lots of abuses for these people. They don't live enjoyable lives because of you. The harm principle applies, okay? Lastly, comparative, why are we better off? First, one, I want to note the average person in South Korea actually lives like a very decent life. That's because the South Korea Korean economy is one of the largest economies within Asia. It also has like a booming tech sector, so on and so forth. So, and also has one of the largest main income rates within Asia. So you probably have lots of money, so you get to do that. But secondly, on our side of the house, if you really want to do like music, guys, you can always go to the pub to sing karaoke with your, with your mates or whatever. On their side of the house, it's not even that you are producing the music that you like. You'll be producing the music that the talent agency forces you to produce. So if it is about artistic freedom, you don't get that on their side. But lastly, I want to say that in terms of, you know, long-term finances, we are better off because in South Korea, there's a huge problem with people who get old. Old people are not seen as desirable anymore, and they are thrown out again because of the saturation and the fact that you were replaced. So in the long run, they don't get lots of money and they don't get lots of fame, again, panel for women who are already screwed by the patriarchy, but further screwed because of K-pop. For protecting the mental health of this individual, the physical health of this individual, and to not cause harm to other people, very proud to propose.

    PM says things like beauty norms and mental health are bad in South Korea. Speaks to how little of their case is actually inherent to the motion. A lot of the same problems are still going to exist for the average South Korean, but being a K-pop star gives you more money, more identity, and more subversive power to escape the mundanities of life. I'm going to be talking about three things in this speech. Firstly, about why a higher raw salary is the easiest thing to weigh in this debate. Secondly, about broader purpose in your life. And then finally, about day-to-day enjoyment on money. I want to start by responding to the claim they can just be replaced at any point. Number one, the motion says a K-pop star. This is not about people who are trying to break into the industry, but we have fiat power to say that you are probably going to be quite successful and therefore having like a unique skill set that allows you to be the next side or the next famous person. Secondly, if their characterization is true that industries are literally recruiting you at age seven, it is probably the case that they put quite a lot of work into that you become tied to the brand and therefore it's going to look quite bad for them reputationally they just decide to let you go. Let's talk about capital. What does the average salary look like in South Korea? That's going to clash with the characterization that we hear at the end of PM. Number one, there tends to be relatively high degrees of income inequality due to the domination of table industries or people at the top make a lot of money but these are often tied to state kind of patronage networks. Unless you are running these companies, if you're a worker, you don't really have an incentive to treat you super well so the average person is not paid a super high salary. Secondly, economic prospects are quite bleak into the future for the average person. There's an aging population. It is true that they have a tech sector but it's also true that you're competing with China, which has massive state-owned investment into these industries and like Taiwan that also produces things like semiconductors to a large extent. Thirdly, there are problematic kinds of gender norms when it comes to the economy, in particular where women tend to be locked at a higher level of corporate position because the brand of Catholicism that was perpetuated by colonial powers just marginalized women to a large extent. Therefore, they are locked out of these positions on balance and earn lower salaries. On the comparative, if you're a K-pop star, you are literally earning millions of dollars from things like raw things that you're paid by your industry when you go touring, from things like sponsorships, even from things like advertising on your Instagram. You can kind of become an influencer in a way. You just get really, really rich. So, I know that like the money argument is not super popular in debate. I think it's super, super important for three reasons. The first thing to say is that even if you do not care about yourself, you have other obligations in your life you tend to value quite highly. You probably care about your partner. You probably care about supporting your elderly parents. You might have kids one day and you want to support them. I think that it brings you a lot of joy when you can see yourself fulfilling obligations that you believe are proximate to you, making other people in your immediate surroundings you love dearly a lot more happy. Secondly, money unlocks choice into the future with your career. If you really hate being a K-pop star, you're able to retire and leave. PM says you can't leave because they take you when you're really young. Two things to say. Number one, like you literally can. Like if you're 20 and you're not enjoying the industry, you can just leave. They tried you on this by saying like, but you are now coerced into being a K-pop star. Like I think that even if you're involved in an industry for a long time, you still know what your preferences are and this is really important, panel. If you're coerced to be a K-pop star because they convince you that you really, really like it, if you really, really like it, I'm unclear why it matters if you were coerced in the first place because the actual level of utility that you're experiencing is still quite high at the end of the day. The third thing to say is that money just unlocks a variety of hedonistic pleasures that are very, very important. You can go and eat at night restaurants, you can go and travel to museums that you really love in the world. You know, the best way to get mental health help is having a crap ton of money. You're better able to do all these things under our state of the house and actually experiencing daily kinds of joys. And I want to note that the classic response is like, but you get used to it. Like you don't. Hedonistic pleasures like eating amazing food are things that bring you a daily burst of joy when you actually experience them. I want to give you a very important weighing mechanism of this argument into this debate. We cannot be sure what your preferences are as the average individual. We cannot say whether you like fame. We cannot say whether you like privacy. Therefore, the most rational weighing metric in this round is allowing the individual to choose what their preferences are for themselves. And therefore, the best way to do that is to maximize the capital that we have because we're not being a K-pop star 24 hours a day. We have other things in our lives and therefore we can better allocate capital in that regard. Secondly, let's talk about broader purpose in life and how we think about ourselves. I want to just briefly rebut their claim about like you can't get an education. Like you can often do it on the side, right? Like even if you're getting into this when you're younger, or you can just go back to school. I would posit that what the human psyche really wants is for us to feel like we matter in the world and like we mean something to other people. I think that there's a few things inherent to being a K-pop star in particular that give us a level of purpose that cannot be accessed by things like family, friends, or the economy. The first thing to say is that you feel like you're making other individuals happy on a daily basis. When I'm performing at a concert, I see kids who are beaming at me. I make a kid's day when I write my autograph on their head or like on their head or on like whatever paper note that they're holding. I see people holding posters that are cheering for me in the crowd. I think that most moral systems emphasize notions of kindness and selflessness and therefore we are indoctrinated to believe that bringing happiness to other people ends up being a moral good. Therefore, we end up perceiving ourselves as being a better person and it just makes it easier for us to live with ourselves and we feel like we're doing a good thing by making other people happy and get a warm fuzzy feeling inside. The second thing to say is that you feel like you're leaving a huge legacy which is really, really important. But when I die, I'm not actually going to die because everyone is going to remember my name and you feel less like just a small specter of dust in the universe. I think that legacy matters for a few reasons. Firstly, I think it helps you get through hard times when you feel like your life has a broader purpose at the end of the day. Secondly, I think it helps buffer against forms of nihilism as well where you feel less like you're just cogs in a capitalist machine, like an irrelevant speck of dust, but rather like our life assumes a broader degree of significance because we're going to matter after our death. But finally, this kind of identity is unique because it allows us to ground purpose in a way that's unique to others. Everyone might try and find purpose in their jobs, but you are finding purpose in something that only 2% or 1% of the population can access, which is being a K-pop star. I think that there tends to be social veneration of notions of uniqueness because it makes us feel like an independent person and we are often told by like our parents just like be unique, be special, be cool when we were younger and therefore you feel like you are distinctly a good person relative to others. Before I continue, OG.

    > POI: Most people who are abused are conditioned to like the abuse. Are you for that because that seems to be the ...

    No, okay, I'm just going to give a bunch of reasons why abuse is not going to happen. I don't think you are conditioned to like abuse. I think you would leave if you were being abused because it hurts. It's emotionally traumatizing for you. Let's talk about day-to-day experiences and fun. What does life look like due to capitalism? People are not choosing what they are doing under their side of the house. You often just have to go into what your parents want you to, or you have to go into whatever the dominant industries of South Korea are, which are often manufacturing and tech. Not everyone's preferences are aligned with them. They ever end up locking people into something that is not actually what their preference is. Even if you think that these industries are abusive, that is uncomparative because you lack choice over industries under their side of the house when it's dictated by the whims of the economy. The act of K-pop is fun for a few reasons. First, there tends to be a large degree of camaraderie between other people within your group, like BTS and Black Thing, being quite close. This is different from other kinds of friendship because you have a lot of shared experiences while you're on tour together, and finding so much time with one another allows you to know one another a lot more intimately. Secondly, you get to travel and see the world. I think a lot of people find this very fun because it's just boring to see surroundings all the time. I think that it unlocks joys when you understand things a lot better. They say, "But these industries are bad." What about beauty norms? Number one, this is uncomparative. Like beauty norms, as PM concedes, things like cosmetic surgery are prevalent in South Korea overall. Secondly, though, once you become really famous, we're better able to subvert these things because you know that you're always going to have some level of fan base, even if you do something like gain a little bit of weight or wear clothes that are more subversive. Therefore, when you already have a cult of personality, you have way more subversive power than the average person, which is why K-pop stars often do things like set new fashion trends. That ultimately exists for all these reasons. I'm very proud to stand in opening opposition.

    Kim Jong-hyun, the lead member of the band SHINee, committed suicide at the age of 27 last year after repeatedly talking about mental health problems and getting flak for it on Twitter. Five members of the male K-pop band Big Bang were implicated in a sexual abuse scandal where they were incurring sexual favors of women in order to hang out with them. Soon-lee, the lead member of the band f(x), committed suicide after repeatedly talking about mental health problems and getting flak for it on Twitter. Five members of the male K-pop band Big Bang of the band f(x) killed herself last year for similar reasons to do with mental health, and finally, Goo Hara, lead member of band Kara, also killed herself for body expectation pressures raised on her in the industry. These are unfortunate examples to mention, panel, but these are problems which are germane to the K-pop industry, and I'm going to show to you why. The first thing that this says is that salary is important. I would posit that salary is important insofar as it's instrumental towards your happiness. If I'm in bonded labor and I'm making a million a year, I don't necessarily care because I don't have the time to enjoy that money. I have high expectations placed on me, and I am fundamentally not free. Number two, there's a past dependency problem that they miss where the point at which you do exit the industry, you can't go anywhere else because you joined at the age of seven. You don't have the education and the skills necessary to go into another industry. Their only response to this was you can simply quit. I mean you can, but like you'll be messed up otherwise. It's like sports people, right? Unfortunately, past 35 if they've made enough money, they're fine, otherwise they're not, but see they assume that BTS is getting the money in the first place. These contracts are very exploitative for the reasons that Taha gave, like companies coerce you into contracts where BTS literally touring last year before the pandemic was living in a hostel while their company was making millions of dollars. This is the problem when you get eight-year-olds under the pretense of parents who just want their kids to be famous signing contracts. You don't make informed choices, which is even in their best world they get very low salaries for these people, but finally they said salaries are instrumental towards relationships. What relationships when you are on tour 24-7, when the media is on your case in terms of who your boyfriend is, who your girlfriend is, the person that you love, God forbid if they're gay because then you're not going to get another signing contract, but secondarily your family is never going to have enough time for you because they will consistently make it about your elderly mother having schizophrenia or whatever it may be, which means that even if the salary is instrumental towards getting better outcomes for your family, your family is significantly compromised in their world. The second claim then was that the point at which you have money, you can make choices which can change the narratives of the industry. The first thing I want to point out here, which I think is really important, is that you are conditioned into the cycle of abuse. They completely ignore this point of information. If you've been from the age of eight and nine used to a regime where people abuse you through systematic practice regimes, you will practice for 18 hours a day or else you will practice for 16 hours a day or we won't give you the money, but secondly in the worst case also pay sexual and physical abuse, then not only do you normalize it for yourself, you normalize it for others, you don't recognize it within the industry because that's been the fundamentally normal trade-off that you've been making in your entire life. This was the unfortunate story of Hollywood for a long time, but number two, who becomes a K-pop star in the first place, right? The sort of person who gets selected in the audition studio after 300 people showing up is probably the person who has a bit more connections with their parents than other people do. What this means then is that even as an anonymous person, you are likely to have a significantly middle-class upper-middle-class life where you can make a reasonable amount of money on our side. The final thing then is in terms of legacy. One, why is a legacy important? Lots of people live lives where they don't feel an intention to leave behind a legacy. This is like intuition bias and debating, right? We're all full of ourselves and arrogant so we want to leave behind legacies. The vast majority of the planet does not give a care. They live a good life and they move on with their lives, so they believe in God statistically like two-thirds of the planet so they're going to be fine in the afterlife. But three and most importantly, why is your legacy not "I left behind a child who I cared for, I got a promotion in my local job"? Like normal people have normal legacies, and two, if you've not become a K-pop star, then you don't have the expectations of a K-pop star, so there's a temporal gap in their problem, so you just have the legacies of a normal person who enjoys the anonymity on our side. What is standing still from our side which has not been rebutted? Hey, you are actively complicit in the harms given to other young teenage girls the point at which you enter their industry. The only response to this was peripheral, which is that even if you're an average anonymous Korean person, you might follow this person. Yes, but there's a difference between me taking a loan from JP Morgan and working for JP Morgan. In one side, I'm actively complicit in the abuses scored to people such as myself and other people, but secondly and much more importantly, this argument stands upstream of all of the arguments on salary, upstream of all of the arguments about you having a better life. If you're complicit in the suffering of millions of other people who also did not make informed choices, then we are significantly likely to win the debate. The next thing I want to do is focus on our outcomes or physical and mental health before I do that. I'm going to take engagement from CO. Go ahead.

    > POI: There is increasing commercial pressure to deal with the kind of scandals that you're talking about because people care very deeply about these stars. Why were corporations buying into that pressure?

    Um, systemic reasons that Kaha gave for how Korea has a conservative domestic culture. So, I don't know why they would land on your side of the debate and not our side. But secondly, speaking, how did it deal with Britney Spears? How did it deal with Lindsay Lohan? It wasn't like, "Guys, there's a problem, we should talk about this in the open and have public discourse." Let's shut her up in a hospital room and give guardianship to people. This is the exact same thing that's going to happen in K-pop. Where the more fans are concerned about BTS, the more they will be muzzled, the more they will be censored, the more they will be systematically locked out of giving press conferences. So, if anything, the more the abuses scale, the more the newspapers talk about it, companies have greater and greater incentives to coerce you into silence and to coerce you into acceptance. Note: your albums do not sell if you come out and say, "I have a tragic, depressing life and no one cares about me." But secondly, also importantly, you don't choose the creative direction of your music. This was analysis completely missed by Leader of Opposition. You choose the music with charts. Well, you choose the music which the marketing analysts say will win, like the four chords that I use in every song at this point in our world. At least, even if you're an anonymous Korean citizen, you can once a year play in the karaoke. I'm part of a very amateur band because I dream to be a musician, and I'm happy for that to give me musical and artistic satisfaction. But it doesn't come with the downside of celebrity, the coercion of fame, all of that bad stuff, which means that we can still engage musically in our world without necessarily being compromised. Finally, then, why do we win as an anonymous citizen? The first thing I want to point out here, which I think is important, is that you can live a middle-class life because that's what South Korea is like. Know that it was a very surface-level response here, which is that, you know, gender norms, expectations exist outwards elsewhere in South Korea. That's like saying that gender norms exist in academia and modeling. They're obviously worse in modeling. Like, I just don't know how to rebut that, Name. Right? Because I am willing to lose this debate on the intuition that the average bank and the average school and the average hospital has much less gender norm expectations than the K-pop industry does. But secondly, speaking, you save up money. You save up money because you're not contingent on a career that ends at age 34 because you're not good looking enough, you're not young enough, all of that stuff. But thirdly and finally, panel, I challenge this intuition that everyone is a hedonist trying to satisfy themselves. Again, get outside of the debate bubble, right? Some people are happy. Most people across the planet, statistically, are happy having a bit of money on the side, going for one holiday a year to France, and that's good enough for them. I... It's unclear to me by having everything like in the Sharpie Evans High School Musical style is the only life that you're willing to get behind, as opposed to having a house, having a family, and being happy. Panel, this is an extraordinarily exploitative regime of child abuse on their side. You can't stand behind this. Live the anonymous life. That's what we stand behind. I'm very, very proud to propose.

    Each was a "dynamite", "mic drop," whereas "On" prop, "Life Goes On," those are the only K-pop songs I know. Firstly, I'm going to chat about the principle. Secondly, I'm going to discuss the industry and how it can get better. Finally, on the individual on complicity, there are three things I want to say here. The first thing to say is that the more they say that you are conditioned, that you have no agency when you're acting in this particular way, the less you can say they are complicit for anything. For example, if I was told my entire life that I should do X thing, if everyone around me pushed me to do X thing, if there are dangerous outcomes if I don't do X thing, my responsibility morally for doing X thing is very, very, very, very low. In the same way that if I have a gun to my head and I do something, it is not really my responsibility. So the more they push claims that you are pushed into this particular way of life, the less you are complicit. Secondly, should we really be held responsible for being a very, very, very, very small part of a particular problem? K-pop is still going to exist on their side of the house. All of these problems are still going to persist. I'm going to go for a long drive to McGill with my mother after this tournament is over, and that is going to be damaging for the environment very much. But I wouldn't really say that I am morally responsible and shouldn't go in that way of life because it's such a benefit to me and such a very, very low harm compared to such a massive harm of climate change. Overall, it seems very, very strange to say that complicity is a really big moral metric here. Thirdly, you could change the industry from within yourself, i.e., you could speak out against those norms. Now let's explain how that works because Humza gives the response that you're, you know, going to face tons of backlash from this. First of all, you have tons of leverage, and I know Naomi gave this response, and Humza rebuilds it by saying, "Well, there isn't really tons of other industries that you can go into, and you might not have tons of money." First, you are already a star, you already do have tons of money. Secondly, your stardom is not tied to being in a particular company, it is tied to being in the public sphere. You are still going to be able to get endorsements after, you will still be able to go to other companies. This is particularly true in the context of K-pop, where American and North American and European competition is now seeping in slowly as it has become a predominant business model within the West as well. Look at how BTS's new song "Dynamite" was written and produced by Americans because this is something that is seen as a good business model. This is also a reason for why the industry is likely to liberalize because if there are other options and corporations that you can go to as a K-pop star, this leads to a positive pressure to make conditions as good as possible for everyone in this field. This is also a reason for why you are able to write many of your own songs because this is literally trends that are often set by K-pop and by K-pop stars themselves, right? Like K-pop in the West was not something that really existed until four or five years ago, but trends changed and people enjoy different sorts of music in the same way that trends in music change all the time. So it's not the case that you're just locked into this fundamentally like caging sense, a sense of music under the other side of the house. But finally, contracts are getting way, way better. Now, their characterization is you get signed when you're seven. This seems very, very bizarre to me, and the reason for that is quite simple. It is because you don't know if someone is going to be good when they are seven. So you're spending tons and tons of money into like tons of seven-year-olds. Like you're paying them loads, you're signing huge contracts with their parents, parents who are giving up their own middle-class lifestyle for this in many instances. So it just seems bizarre that they would actually be signing people at seven years old. It's much more plausible that you wait until someone's like 18, 19, someone's very skilled. But at that point, someone has probably other options that they could sign with. There's a positive, you know, positive incentive type good competition. This is why like musicians are paid a lot of money when they are stars. It's not the case that you just get signed exploited contracts. But finally, contracts renew over time. Like you can't sign to a lifetime contract. You have to renew it. So you know, when you get a lot more money, you can, you know, do it later. This is important because you have the agency to even if you don't believe you have the agency to do many things, to do some things. For example, you can have access to therapy if you would like. Now, they might say, "Ah, but you know, there's going to be so much scrutiny that you won't be able to." Like, you can go to online therapy. You can go to therapy in the secret. Like, if your therapist reveals that you're going to them, like, they can literally get sent to prison because of like client privilege. Like, we just suggest that you are able to access those sorts of mental health things on the other side of the house. The industry is getting better, especially when you are going to be in it. Finally, like, there are just other modes of being a K-pop idol that can exist. Like, the example of Psy obviously is trivial, but it does suggest and point to the fact that it is not a necessary and fundamental requirement to look a certain way. There are obviously pressures that push you in a certain direction, but you're able to, if you're really, really skilled at music and are a star that already has a cult of personality, you are able to do certain things in that instance, right? So you're able to diversify your own portfolio of interest, I guess is what I'm saying. Finally, why was money indeed important? I want to point out, K-pop in South Korea is not just like a normal industry. It's not like you live a normal life. It's not like you have normal prestige. K-pop is one of the most prestigious organizations in that entire country. It is very, very much different from living a normal middle-class lifestyle because you are valorized as a person. The very fact that they think that you're going to be taken down a peg if you do something wrong shows how valorized you are in the first place. Because the only reason that you would be taken down a peg if you did something wrong would be if you were expected to be good in the first instance. What this suggests is it is a much deeper level of entitlement and power and prestige that was important for you as an individual. This is really important because scrutiny on an everyday level is not important if you feel fulfillment as a result of that scrutiny. There are three reasons why you're more likely to have positive comments that outweigh negative ones that you might get on prop side. Firstly, there's more often that you just get way more of them because you have that cult of personality that we already mentioned and OG mentions as well. There are so many fans that are really, really integrated with only within your own lifestyle, especially fans who are typically younger and less conservative than their forebears. They won't necessarily care as much if you come out as gay, for example. But also, you can diversify your interest to other countries, for example, going to North America for tours. So it's less likely that you rely on the South Korean demographic. Secondly, your social media managers and social media sites are likely to be filtered in ways which benefit you, i.e., your managers don't want to make you feel really shitty, so they're going to decrease the amount of negative comments that you get to see because they don't want you to quit or leave or go to therapy or whatever. I'll take CG before I move on.

    > POI: So for the past 5 000 years have koreans been taught that it's good to be extraordinary or ordinary?

    I think most people have been taught to be extraordinary, and the reason for that is very simple. Extraordinary people do things that benefit society. We are told that we ought to strive for greatness in school, be the best at our jobs, and strive for the most money. All of these things are taught in order to be unique and benefit the rest of society. We are cultured and indoctrinated to believe that. But the last reason why you're more likely to receive positive comments is that it's more likely to match up with what the people around you are saying. They say, "Well, you can't have any friends like the ones you can have friends within the industry, you can have friends within your K-pop group like BTS, which has 10 members for what I know, but also you can just have other friends who you have deep connections with, maybe someone who you grew up with at school that you are still friends with that doesn't rely on fame for you to be friends." Trivially, I think that you can still have relationships under our side of the house, so they're likely to confirm the positive comments that you get and deny the negative ones, and those are typically people that you trust. Finally, industry norms are going to be problematic regardless. The average quality of life is not like the poorest in the world, but it's still obviously not as good as K-pop. Insofar as you are often still having the same gender norms put upon you, i.e., it is much more difficult if you unluck out and become a woman under their side of the house to access things like a job because your husband tells you to stay home and society tells you to stay home as well. It was less likely that industry norms were bad because industry norms wanted to relate to the people who were in that industry who had much power over it, and therefore it was more likely that they were malleable, whereas in general society, each individual person has very, very little control. The gender norms that they talk about, as well as the social perceptions of looking beautiful, still apply. The question was whether you were able to change those norms by wearing new clothes, by looking in a different way, where K-pop idols have significant power, whether you're just someone who had to follow. We're very proud to oppose.

    On basis, their case on success and joy. Success is fickle; joy is non-existent. After that, a lot of comparatives where the average anonymous person is better off. Why success fickle? Not that K-pop is an incredibly competitive market. Numerous stars exist at one time; numerous people want to join that market. This means that your success, even if you're very successful now, can end very quickly. One single scandal of collaborating with a rival group, one single wrong statement, one single sex scandal is something that can destroy your entire career. We see this in Europe with people like Beautify, with people like Tati. Not that insofar as this market is incredibly competitive, not that your rivals have an incentive to do this. They have an incentive to set you up; they have an incentive to manufacture scandals. Even if this doesn't happen, I think it's incredibly consistent stress insofar as you cannot enjoy your success because you're always worried about whether success is going to dissipate tomorrow. Secondly, know that opening opposition saying there are trends literally proves you can be a one-hit wonder. Now, this does not guarantee your success in one year or two years time. There is a huge amount of these stars lose viewership after they leave for, let's say, compulsory military service, which they are not exempt from in South Korea, which means the success in and of itself on their side of the house is not necessarily likely to begin with. But on the level of joy, if opening opposition concedes that these norms, which are negative, exist on both sides of the house, then they also can see that it's not just the industry that is toxic, the fans that are toxic. It is the fans that expect you to look one particular way, who send you death threats, who insult your looks and so on and so forth, which means that what you feel at the end of the day is you haven't changed yourself or someone else and there's still not being enough insofar as this adoration is what you depend on for validation and you're unlikely to get it and there's negativity biased towards these negative comments. I think you feel like bullshit, but I think they also defeat their own opt-out mechanism when they say you have this idea that you want to provide for your family and so on and so forth. It's incredibly hard to leave and you feel guilty about leaving at the point where this is the avenue that you provide for your family, so there is no opt-out mechanism on the opposition on the rebuttal to this, which is liberalization. A couple of reasons why it doesn't happen. First of all, not there's a monopoly in this industry like YG has pretty much bought out all of the lower companies, which means they have no incentive to reform. As far as there's no competition. Secondly, so many people want to enter this industry because of the idealization that opening opposition uses as the mechanism for their arguments, which means that there is implicit idea if you don't accept this horrible condition, someone else will. So you are disincentivized against rebelling against this. But thirdly, there's bad dependency. You've seen how previous stars have succeeded, so you have an incentive to adapt to this if you want success. But even if you do leave, you're always going to be recognized on the street. You're always going to remember this trauma and all of this, so it's not like you get to enjoy your later life if you're traumatized and have to go to a therapist, which you may or may not pay, as Matthew Farrell says. So we think opening opposition at their best, we prove success is unlikely; we prove that joy is incredibly unlikely. As for their own framework, let's explain why we think the average person is better off. First of all, not the average person gets to enjoy day-to-day joys, and I think Naomi gives a fantastic example for this. You go to a K-pop star, you go to a concert, and you sign this kid's autograph. You know, on our side of the house, you get to be the kid whose autograph is signed. The comparative within this interaction is equal insofar as both individuals are related. The comparative is, as the kid, you go home afterwards, you watch more YouTube videos, and you remember the best night of your life, and you don't know what goes on behind the scenes for this particular star. Average individuals, even if norms are negative on both sides of the house, get to go to concerts, get to go to football games, get to spend time with their family, get to go for fines. They have day-to-day ways of coping with their lives, which they can do without the additional stress and baggage that opening opposition concedes exists when they say that norm is just on both sides of the house. Then, comparatively, these norms are worse for these K-pop stars, given that they're always recognized. It's impossible to do so on our side of the house. You are able to have mechanisms to cope with the hard life that exists on both sides of the house. On their side, they've given you no coping mechanism, apart from the fact that you have money. They haven't explained how money onset offsets unhappiness. But the second response to this is we have to characterize Korean society, and this is why, lover, as the POI in Korean society, an average day-to-day life is glorified as part of Confucian culture. It is the idea that caring for your family, fulfilling obligations to people near to you, settling down with a job, and living a peaceful life is something you should value because the value of peace is connected to the spirituality that Koreans are taught transgenerationally through their families and through the educational system. Because this is how you achieve spiritual equilibrium. If you live with harmony with others, this means that one, money in and of itself is not something that is valued insofar as it's not conducive to you fulfilling the idea of peace. But secondly, it's something that you as an average Korean strive towards and probably desire in middle-class life because you see your family, your grandma, your grandpa telling you about who maybe times were better before when there was not this much individualism. It's probably inculcated in you and you believe in this spiritual culture. But secondly, we said most Koreans have economic security, and it's not just the idea our Koreans, you know, developed economy civilization is good. Opening opposition, I would agree there's maybe corruption at the top, but tables employ the best majority of the Korean economy because Koreans work in family units. In tables, families are recruited as specific working units in specific sectors and given that they are operated largely through logic to more of a public system than a private system, it's incredibly unlikely you get laid off insofar as this is not a competitive industry but a largely public-run industry, which means that most people have economic security and tables are inherited between families. This means that families who are employed in a previous generation also get to inherit their spots, which means in a huge amount of situations, you have the ability to pursue education, to go to these trips, to enjoy all of these nice things because you have some money savings. There's not the harms of being a K-pop star. But even if corruption is a problem, reform is incredibly likely because recently been a huge anti-corruption wave within Korea. The previous prime minister was deposed because of this. The current is unlikely to win the future election because he's being targeted, especially for not reforming this. Even if my corruption is a problem, it's likely to become egalitarian over time. But we also think it's going to become more egalitarian in two other ways. First of all, that Korea, given the Confucian culture I mentioned earlier, is also a strong welfare state. There are things like minimum wage laws, there are things that can employment subsidies, there are things like public housing, something's a huge amount of people in South Korea have public housing. These are policies path-dependent and bipartisan on left-wing and the right-wing, which means that even if you're not a high middle class, as Hamsa says, you still have access to baseline security. Before I go to identity liberalization, opening opposition.

    > POI: Confucianism might have been true during the 1900s, during the dictatorship, but due to the fact that it was associated with Park, there's a lot of backlash to that because it's interacting with forms of repression. I think society has changed over time to appreciate forms of uniqueness more.

    No, Naomi, literally, was the opposite. The Catholic Church was associated with oppression because this was the religion of the colonizers. Confucianism is the original Korean ideology, and part of the reclamation of the Korean identity was arguing for these values. This is why, apart from in southeastern South Korea where people are Buddhists, which is a religion, most South Koreans are not religious. Which means that even though they're conservative in terms of things such as beauty standards and how you're supposed to look, they're not necessarily conservative in terms of identity suppression. And this is likely to change over time, even if you buy opening opposition's the status quo, because there's a huge wave of progressivism, there's contact with the West through social media. If you want to buy the mechanisms from opening opposition's why the institution, the industry is going to liberalize, which explains why it won't regardless, then you also have to buy that the wave of progressivism happens on our side as well, and there's going to be more acceptance of LGBTQ minorities, there's going to be more acceptance of women. It's symmetrical. What's not symmetrical is that the harms of the industry itself, regardless of liberalness or conservativeness, exist on both sides of the house. We've taken off at their best, we've proven the comparative. For all of these reasons, closing government.

    It's a shame that nobody read the topic of this debate, because this wasn't a debate simply about whether you prefer to be a K-pop star or if you prefer to be a Korean. It was whether you prefer to be a K-pop star or an average anonymous Korean. Emphasis on the term "anonymous" there, because the burden of this government bench wasn't simply to show that life in Korea was good; it was to show that living a life where you were completely anonymous in Korea was one that was good. We think living an anonymous life is one that's extremely harmful, mainly because there's no capacity for you to actually attain notoriety. That was extraordinarily sad for three reasons. Firstly, you couldn't gain recognition in any field that you wanted to enter. Secondly, you couldn't land any meaningful legacy. Note that opening opposition talk about legacy being something that's important, but we say that it's not just that you can't get a legacy as a K-pop star, it's that you can't get a legacy at all whatsoever, which is a far more meaningful plan. But thirdly, at the point we have to be an anonymous brand, it exacerbates all of the harms of opening opposition talk about. That is to say, you're not comparing your wage to just the average Korean; you're comparing your wage to the average anonymous Korean, which obviously knocks out with a high profile for people who probably reap the higher salaries and move that average up. So you're probably now in the lower echelon of people within Korea, which meant you were living in a way that was not particularly fantastic, contrast when you had a K-pop career, which was to say that at worst, you probably experienced a lot of the stresses that the government teams rightly point out exist in this debate, but at least you were doing it for your family, you were able to have some sort of meaningful expression of your life, later you're having to, uh, capacity to actually attain some sort of legacy. What are the two preemptive responses we get to this material on anonymity? Firstly, opening government says nobody gives a shit about glory and legacy, and secondly, point guard in a point of information, closing government suggests that Koreans are conditioned to be extraordinarily ordinary. But note that this entirely contributes almost the entirety of the analysis that comes out from opening government, which is to say that there are pressures in society to look better, to be better, there is extraordinary idolization of these figures. Speaker, it cannot be simultaneously true that being ordinary was the peak of living in Korea, but also the people on mass subscribe to having to make themselves look better, to having to be better. The idolization of these figures, government can only run with one of those characterizations. Their failure to do so and us pointing that out means we're clearly already ahead in this debate. For extensions that come out from closing opposition, firstly, why you necessarily have to be anonymous, which I've already covered. Secondly, why this occupation was not one which was predatory. Thirdly, we'll be the first opposition team to be directly comparative as to what your position is likely to be. And fourthly, we'll be the first opposition team to take the burden that the government sites put at their fullest potential, which is to say that even if you have to suffer for your entire life, that suffering was one that was likely to be meaningful to you, that suffering was one that was likely to be extraordinarily worth it. Onto that second extension there, why this occupation is not particularly predatory. Four things to say here. Firstly, we query in a point of information immediately in response to OG's idea of this harm principle, you're complicit in culture and figures like Psy, for example, don't need to do things like consume diet pills. I understand opening opposition trying to run away with this analysis, but it's obviously something that we initially point out, which was to then say that it's extremely possible to thrive and exist as a K-pop star without subscribing to the worst bits of this culture, without being complicit in that culture. That was particularly and uniquely beneficial for closing opposition. Secondly, though notably, societal standards existed outside of K-pop. You know, at the point where opening government says there are so many plastic surgeries or diet creams being taken, yeah, in wider society as well as in K-pop. And note that at the point where you're an average anonymous Korean, that is, you don't get any notoriety, it's probably relatively like you're not particularly good-looking individual as opposed to when you're a K-pop star, meaning it's extremely likely that you individually felt those pressures in a way that was particularly damaging to your own psyche. Certainly note that the K-pop stars have unique defenses to actually change those societal standards. Fair enough, opening opposition talks about that bit, but fourthly, note that a K-pop star is not necessarily locked into that which they have to do. They could probably write an expose on how poorly they've been treated. The masses of fans they have internationally mean that people probably consume that content, meaning it wasn't necessarily likely you're always actually going to be locked into these industries. Third extension that comes from closing opposition is that we're going to be the first side to give a proper comparative of the exact position you'll find yourself in, and that's on three axes. Firstly, what is your economic position? Secondly, what is your occupational position? Thirdly, how do you get personal fulfillment? Firstly, with respect to your economic position, note that your earnings are likely to be extraordinarily high, and a lot of the analysis particularly comes out from closing government about how this is a tenuous industry probably just falls out of this debate entirely because the topic presupposes you're a K-pop star, meaning you're probably relatively entrenched in these industries, and obviously then the earnings you get are likely to be high. Yes, in some circumstances, it's likely that perhaps like studios take a lot of that money from you, you're obviously going to be earning far, far, far more you never have the possibility to do if you're an average, again, anonymous brand. Contrast then what happens if you just are an average, anonymous brand. There are three particular harms. Firstly, there's a shit pension scheme in Korea. This is something that bizarrely opening government points out, even though it's obviously opposition content, which is to say the old age poverty rate in Korea is four times the OECD average. At the point where you know you're just an average worker, you probably have risks of going into that and falling into those shit pension schemes. That was harmful. Secondly, there was a lot of welfare spending in Korea, at least well below the OECD average, and that meant that your safety net at any given time wasn't particularly strong, and knowing that that's a harm that operates irrespective of whether you ever need to actually go on to welfare to begin with, that is to say just because it's in the back of your mind that the welfare state existing Korea is not extraordinarily robust, that adds stresses to your everyday life. But thirdly, just note the income is well below the OECD average, and as I point out in the introduction of this speech, also comparing yourself to the average anonymous Korean, which also takes out the high-profile grades in direct comparison, so you're probably earning very little. Secondly, your occupational experience. Noting that this is directly responsive to all of the harm and trauma material we hear from two things to say here. Firstly, Korean workplaces aren't so fresh up either. They're typically extraordinarily hierarchical. You're typically overworked in office jobs. You have less capacity for things like self-expression. But secondly, even if you're a kid, you're forced into K-pop, not the alternatives. You're forced to go to school in schools, particularly existing Korean, are often high-stress environments. Thirdly, with respect to personal fulfillment, it's just unlikely you had much because you didn't have an outlet for creative material. But secondly, you probably weren't able to gain political influence because you had to be an anonymous Korean, as the topic presupposes. But secondly, note the political influence the K-pop members have is quite large. Note there are increasing calls for BTS to be exempted from military conscription, which is something that was likely to exist in response to one of the arguments by the government teams. I'll take a point from opening.

    > POI: Yeah, but the explanation as to why they have political influence doesn't stand. At the point where you don't react to the preemptive, which tells that you don't have an incentive to use that political influence, insofar as you want to retain success. It's mutually exclusive.

    No, but you at least have the capacity to attain political success and political notoriety on our side, whereas on your side, you can't even get that opportunity. So, irrespective of what you do to it, we can exclusively point out that at the point where you can at least be, you know, a Korean of note, you have the potential to make any changes. That was the important difference. Fourth extension that comes from closing opposition is to actually take this government at their full burden. That is just no insane sort of things they point out. All the harms they talk about, all the abuses, your complicity. We're going to say that even if you have to go through the worst conceivable, you know, circumstance of being a K-pop star, that was all worth it because your life at that point became a sacrifice you viewed as being taken for two reasons. Firstly, because you could do things like guarantee the livelihood of your family and friends and those around you, because the government talked about Confucian ideology that exists in Korea. Note that taking this sacrifice, probably one that you saw, has been worth it if it meant you could support your families around you. But secondly, you know, insofar as most Koreans were religious of some nature, you'd probably see that sacrifice as being one that was valuable and you reap your reward in the afterlife as a consequence. For those reasons, because you have to be anonymous, because we give a direct comparative as to what your life is likely to look like, and finally, because we show that the suffering is one that was worth it, it's extremely clear, closing opposition wins this debate.

    First, rest of the debate. First of all, comparing yourself to our side of the house, as well, your side probably compares too, but you are surrounded by super rich folks, as opposed to being surrounded by average folks in our cell house, which means that the comparative for yourself house is inherently one where you feel less off, or you always want more because there's always someone richer, more successful, etc., etc. Secondly, on the idea of being average anonymous, they probably mischaracterize what it means to be an anonymous. Here, it means that you're not super famous, not that you're not like a guy who doesn't have friends or no connections at all, but recognize that there are also no responses to our incentives on social security, while these things are reforming, probably relevant for your pension fund, etc., etc. Lastly, the idea of stress and the difficult education system is on our side of the house. Actually, this is our contextualization. This proves our metric of studying for state exams, efforts, the Confucianism of the culture, the sacrifice of that for of that sort is an unacceptable sacrifice from a Westernized, individualized perspective of how people should function and what they should do to the state. What is the acceptable amount of work in the culture that is not something which happens from a Korean perspective, so therefore they need to answer from this side of the perspective why this is unacceptable and why there is no like a huge incentive where you're brought up in this period so that you actually take pride into becoming this and doing something for your community. What is the friend stand opening government or structurally characterizing the way in which economy works for average folks, but also what are the structural social fabrics and values that folks respect? Why this is important for the realization of the average individual? But secondly, the DLO's response to my POI loses the framing debate for them because they run North American norms and messaging as applicable. Oh, extra guarantee success, a beacon on a hill. Comparative is that South Korea is very Confucianism, egalitarian social purpose society where this is not taught but rather from the phone because you are putting yourself before your community. Know that they recognize this and then try to argue the opposite in a POI, which is not enough compared to the material which team brought. But also recognize that the argument about positive power to change and you have an agency to ask help. The second argument is unrealistic given that this will cause negative effects for your popularity and also for the company if you seem to be perceived as unstable or needing help or someone who is not a beacon on the hill who people can look upon. This is something which OG doesn't have any rebuttal engagement, but the first argument is one where you probably can make more effect. This is also where OG is like, "Oh, you can't do anything." We're responding more nuanced way. OG just says you are changed by chained, but recognize that the way in which you do this is likely to be very commercialized and serve the purpose of your faith, eating money, doing show-ups, photo ops, etc. You might rationalize this as still something meaningful, but this is a very low part of your life. The comparative is if you have high tendencies to help, you can do this more effectively as an anonymous person by helping others, volunteering, dedicating your life on our side of the house. So the comparative on this is also something which we exclusively. What about the preference and choice argument and actually how this conflicts opening position given that you are locked out of hanging out and having a meaningful support structure if everyone is indeed, how do you say, like a poor? But the problem is that you are often, how do you say, that you are oftentimes on tours. It is problematic for you to emotionally spend time with other folks as opposed to spending money. Recognize that also this argument that you have friends in other bands is completely unrealistic. So the comparative is that you don't actually compare to your regular and normal friends in how much money you have because you tend to find folks who also have the similar amount of money on you. Because otherwise, these relationships oftentimes don't work because someone has more money and then there's always a problem of them wanting nicer things and you cannot afford nicer things or they're paying for you, etc., etc., which is like the comparative is that you have more of a social fabric and society on our side of the house, something which is also unique in engagement. But also let's weigh the idea of causing harm to others versus having big impacts in terms of fame and happiness and legacy, something which is a deadlock on opening half. The problem here is that whether OG is right or always right, this is still a worst trade-off because you have to weigh huge effects of your behavior and other people's lives. This is very difficult to do from an average person and you have the tendency to negatively perceive your impact if you see criticism in the media, but also the validation that you're used to, which open opposition says does create negative psychological impacts on your interactions with regular folks, such as your family, friends, potential partners, when all you can see every day is tens of thousands of people cheering on you on the stage. But also recognize that OG's arguments are contingent on proving that you actually perceive these consequences, the negative ones, as those of your work. The problem here is that they connect, they don't connect the most important arguments here for their case. The idea that you know you change yourself because this is what the industry wants means that you know there is a possibility people notice you look differently or that they notice you changed your look. This insecurity that is inherently brought to you by this requirement is what why you psychologically do attribute your potential influence as a consequence of your choices, regardless if that's the fact. This is the argument which beats opening opposition mitigating mitigation on that part. But also recognize that the comparative is that your everyday interactions have very clear, unambiguous, and not overwhelming impacts. You have your friends, family, hobbies, colleagues, something's being characterized in this debate, and opening government spends two minutes in their two speeches on what is the average life, your social circle, which is very similar to what you were taught, and most importantly, what others were taught in your country is the good thing to do because this is the average conclusion is a way that your grandparents, that your schools, that basically everyone in your society teaches is the best way. The problem is that the society, if it's very Confucianism and you value averages, you value social egalitarianism, you're serving a higher purpose. The counterfactual is you have to reject all of these things to be brought up in a different way. Therefore, when opening garment says you are brought from this from seven and eight years old, this is not consent. This is not the most relevant thing. The most relevant thing is that in order for you to be brought up in this way so that you value this extraordinary like purpose that you have in society, being a superstar is what contradicts everything that everyone else has told you and will tell you in their society. And this is the unique mechanism which proves why you have less of a social circle and cannot even like hang out with other other stars. OO before I finish.

    > POI: You can only be the kid at the concert if your family has a lot of money. On our side, you need a lot of money to be able to send your kid to the concert. You can bring your families on tour, and at the very least, you can rationalize leaving them sometimes when you know that you were supporting them and giving them the life that they deserve.

    I think it's unrealistic that concerts are generally inaccessible to the average Korean. Even if that's the case, I can enjoy music without ever going to a concert. Literally, I can be the biggest K-pop fan. I can rip off things, always download, never buy a cent, and I can still enjoy this competitively outside the house. The benefit which you put forward is that you can bring family on tours, and the family, which is not rich, is going to really enjoy the very strict schedule and that they can't do anything, that they can give any media time, that they don't see you. So, I don't think that this really is a comparative versus being home with your family, spending holidays with them, not having to perform on Christmas Eve or Christmas night, etc., etc. Last year, the idea of a lot of money, this is not something which OG. I think thoroughly engaged, so this is really important for the economic standing of an average person. They say aging population, but recognize that the aging population is a symptom of a developed country, right? The natal rates go down because you are very developed and because people choose not to have too many kids because the society has so much change that you have different ways of spending life, career, blah, blah. So, I think this defeats their argument, but also recognize that we are the ones who give you unique incentives or why the society is very egalitarian or why it is reforming in ways in which it is not necessarily meritocratic, something which doesn't happen on opening government. So, for all these reasons, CG.

    I'm not a massive K-pop fan, but I am a really good big sister. When I took my little sibling, Anna, to a Stray Kids concert in Sydney, it was impossible to remain impartial. Literally thousands of young people in the crowd were caught up in the energy. The atmosphere was completely electric, and the band was completely devoted to the act. So, if OG believes that you are complicit in beauty norms because you participate in them, imagine how much more complicit you are in the absolute joy of these fans. In that ability to be known, to be influential, to inspire people, we thought that that brought you an inestimable amount of utility. And if CG believes that because you're Confucian, you care more about the collective than the individual, we thought the ability to inspire so many people, to bring them along on a journey, to give them hope, and for them to care about you so deeply probably meant a lot to you. Nonetheless, I'm going to do two things in this speech. First of all, I'll talk about how much agency you actually have as a K-pop idol, and then secondly, I'll talk about when your lifestyle is likely better. On the first one, then, about how much agency you have as a K-pop idol, because much of the government's case, including OG's principle, rests on the idea that K-pop idols have no power whatsoever to change society and the harms of the industry. A few ideas then in response to what we hear from OG and to an extent CG, I suppose, as well. The first thing to say is that all of the problems that are identified by OG are well known. They are attracting increased scrutiny, which means that there is more and more pressure on the industry to change. And their claim here is just like, well, the industry shuts you down, the industry stops you from speaking up. But we thought this was unlikely to be true because even if you, as an individual, did not speak out, the kind of scandals, you know, created by other people's mental health crises, created like literally already exist, were already putting pressure on fans to demand better from the industry. And I think something that the government bench literally just does not acknowledge in this debate is how deeply fans care about you, how much fans want K-pop stars to have good outcomes. And we think that that probably means that there is substantial pressure on these industries to change. We would also note, obviously, that CG knifes their opening when they tell us that there is this huge wave of progress, which probably does mean that life is getting better for K-pop stars. If that is true, the second thing to say is that OG concedes that not all K-pop stars are bound to the kind of beauty standards and things that they're talking about. See someone like Psy, whose satirical and memetic power obviously did not come from his appearance, that won fans around the world, which probably suggests that as a K-pop star, you are able to do things like identify a niche and escape these pressures to an extent. I think the third thing to say, though, is it is obviously absurd to suggest that you are culpable for industry harms. But even if that is true, the huge amount of joy you much more directly create is likely able to sort of make up for that. You know, obviously, you are probably key in the joy of fans around the world, but you're probably not keen key in the fact that people, you know, want to get plastic surgery. But I think the most important thing to say here is that, like, you know, given that you have, you know, millions or whatever of adoring fans who care very deeply around the world, this typically gave you an enormous platform to try to create change. You know, that does not necessarily have to look like undermining the industry. It can also just look like, you know, say, see like Rose from Blackpink speaking out about LGBT rights. This gives you a platform that you simply would not otherwise have, and we think that that is immensely important in an emotional to feel like you can impact the world, to feel like you can make the world better for people other than you. But more importantly, it's just useful. I think to note that people, like, in an everyday life sense also, like, huge amounts of agency. That is to say that, you know, everyone in this debate has acknowledged they are also likely to be tied to beauty norms. People are bound to capitalist success. To the extent that K-pop stars are fundamentally not free, like OG says, we thought someone slaving away in an office was probably also not free. The third thing to say is that actually, we would say that everyday people are bound to social norms far more strictly. For the reason that they do not have the kind of, well, of goodwill that they can fall back on, the well of money that they can fall back on. So we would say that they are far more bound to the conservative social norms that OG is so worried about. But finally, we would say that normal people do not have a platform whatsoever. CG tries to strawman us on anonymity. We're not claiming you literally, like, you know, you have to wear a mask all the time. The point is that no one will ever remember your name. No one, you know, you're not notable in any field or meaningful to anyone. You know, beyond a very personal, individual sense. And what that meant is if there were things about society that frustrated you, you had absolutely no capacity to change them. You could not make a meaningful change to that. And that is why our idea of giving you a platform of giving you an ability to inspire people was so particularly important. All right, moving on then to discussing when is your life likely to be better, noting that I think there are two levels here. The first one being about living standards and the second being that kind of how you feel about yourself. On living standards, a few things I would say that before CO, this debate did not have a particularly full picture of what the actual comparative in this debate looks like. We give you a number of details to suggest that this comparative is particularly imperfect. It does have a lot of harms for the individual. This looked like things like huge financial risk. South Korea has a very poor social safety net and a very poor old age pension, which meant that even if the average everyday person has an okay life, they have to contend with the constant threat of financial ruin if something goes wrong in their life. The second thing to say is that Korean workplace culture was particularly toxic. It had high pressure, was highly hierarchical, and the only response we get from CG is like, "Oh, well, people are used to it," or kind of aligned with their values. But note that they're literally like, you know, OG wants to talk about the suicide rate in K-pop. We'll look at the suicide rate in corporate Korea. We thought it was massive. We thought objectively the level of work, the level of struggle that people had to put through, be put through was likely to have negative, you know, psychological effects on them, even if they were, you know, conditioned to try and tolerate it. The final thing to say was that, like, clearly then contrast with that with the enjoyability of a job in K-pop. We thought that that was likely far more fulfilling beyond being more lucrative. I'll take a point from OG.

    > POI: On your anonymity extension, most good doctors, lawyers, and teachers are perfectly anonymous, yet have a bunch of money and lead reasonably good lives, right?

    Uh, I mean, I would say that's probably not true to the extent that, like, if you're really good at those things, you often do have a public profile to an extent. But, you know, even to that, to the point that it is true, this debate is about an average Korean who's not at the top band of income, so that doesn't stand. All right, moving on to the self-image and spirituality extension that we hear from CG. I think this extension is really strange because it weirdly suggests that you can't enjoy your fame because of Confucianism, but you can feel the pain of it because of Confucianism, which doesn't really make sense, right? Because, you know, if it's the case that, like, you feel bad about being famous or because you can't appreciate individual feelings or sensations or whatever, um, then why is it that, like, you can feel jealous of your friends? Surely you're kind of glad for the collective benefit. Like, I think this is a very odd caricature of Confucianism, which doesn't really make a lot of sense. They cannot claim both the heart of both just the harms of that. But I think also that this claim from CG that success is fickle, that you cannot enjoy it, doesn't really make a lot of sense in the first place because, obviously, like, you know, thousands of people around Korea look up to K-pop stars, want to be K-pop stars. So if it's true, like, it just clearly isn't true that Confucianism makes you not value success, given that that is something that people en masse aspire to. Finally, just on the idea that the success is fickle or not meaningful to people, uh, firstly, note that it does have a collectivist dimension in that it often benefits your family or the world generally. But secondly, note that, like, you know, you are very likely to be protected by your fans, protected by your management, because note that this debate is not just about an aspiring K-pop star, but someone who's existingly well-known, who existingly matters very deeply to a lot of people, which means that you're likely insulated from some of the worst consequences this government bench wants to talk about. At the end of the debate, being someone who was anonymous meant that you had to struggle with literally no agency, with no ability to change your circumstances. That uniquely changed if you were a K-pop star, if you had a platform, if you meant a lot to people. That is why we're so proud to oppose.

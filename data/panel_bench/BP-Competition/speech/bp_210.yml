    It is crazy that when it is the bullet that takes the toll, we form courts, but when it is the bacteria, we throw up our hands and we forget like it never happened. To be clear, what are we doing in this debate? Firstly, we broadly expect an international court to be created in alignment with the World Health Organization, and we expect it to be heavily supported by all the countries part of the World Health Organization. We expect us to have the participation of scientists, experts to consistently write technical papers in order to inform our judgments, appointees from each country for judges, and so on. We also expect that participation in the World Health Organization and receiving benefits like aid is conditional to being party to this international court. Why is this likely to be the manifestation of a court? I know up will challenge this. There are seven reasons why we think countries will opt in and why we think this will be effective. First, countries that do not consent to such an authority without themselves having some say in the negotiation of that body would obviously be revolting, so they would like to have some participation given that this body will have some control over the world's health resources, no matter what. Secondly, the second is that this is likely to be a broad worry that the international community is ineffective, which is why they are likely to take these actions into their own hands because they want to make these decisions reasonable. They learn from some mistakes of previous international courts. Thirdly, the third is that people generally care about health as an issue and they want to be a participant to many things that are clearly on the level of a global scale. The fourth is that there is a selfish advantage to imposing stringent regulations in that leaders now are unlikely to face the consequences of being punished as they are on their way out, but will benefit from the legitimacy this provides other authoritarianism or whatever they are. Fifthly, is that there is not the game theoretic advantage in that you are harmed by other states in the case that a pandemic goes awry, so you want to hold other states to account. Sixthly, the advantage is that many benefits you care about like health, education, cheap medical goods, and so on will be contingent on this. And beyond that, there are spillover effects like economic benefits that you might care about, so you want to be party to this in order to receive the benefits of the World Health Organization and so on. So what the crimes are we punishing? So we look to examples like Bolsonaro being unwilling to comply with a recommendation for usage of masks and quarantine measures. We're looking at the unwillingness for China to comply with World Health Organization investigations on the Virology Institute, Wuhan. We're talking about the hoarding of resources in countries and so on vaccines and ventilators. Why do they do these crimes? So there are a variety of reasons we suspect they might do this. They might not be technologically at the time, or they might not have the right decision, or maybe it's just the short-term incentives were too powerful and they felt the need to sacrifice thousands of lives in the future to allay present fears. We will impose punishments such as imprisoning leaders for extended periods of time, taking them out of power, or asking them to be deposed. We're okay with doing this during the crisis if it is feasible to realign national incentives, but we expect that in some cases for it to happen after the fact anyway. So there are two arguments in the speech. First, what are the benefits? Before that, I'll take a POI from closing opposition.

    > POI: So we also tried creating an international court for human crimes and counts against humanity. How successful has that been?

    That's a good question. Maybe you should answer on your speech number one. We believe that there are trivial benefits that encouraging countries to comply with health regulation. Note that this massively changes the incentives of leaders. We identify in the setup for all the reasons we give. We suspect this has gigantic benefits. First, on following the regulations on pandemics. Things like Covid, potential future ones like SARS, preventable diseases like malaria. First, we enjoin the prevention of future harm from occurring to people because measures are taken to overturn the anti-short-term. The short-term incentive to focus on keeping the economy afloat instead of the long-term incentive of acting early. We're able to mobilize health forces to start early lockdown in areas that would not have otherwise done it. Which means that we prevent massively the spread of diseases while they are still easy to solve. Secondly, this allows for effective health care response in that actual policies imposed by the World Health Organization are substantially more effective than once implemented on the ground because they have access to a greater breadth of resources such as health experts from all around the world who have access to various different contexts and so on. Thirdly, they benefit from a cohesive response in the sense that lockdowns and other policies become ineffective since pandemics don't recognize borders. Even if the spread is very slow in one place, if it is open in another place, the spread might still continue and as such, you will have to keep it locked down for as long as everyone has kept their borders open. We also suspect the allocation of effective resources to where it's most needed. It is crazy that in the Philippines, hospitals are missing ventilators, vaccines, and beds while there are storehouses full of them in the Western world. We suspect it will be a massive benefit simply to put places when resources in some countries into other countries and to allow access to these things at the threat of imprisoning people for hoarding resources. For future potential gain, notably this also deals with massive future benefits such as antibiotics. Where in the sense that in the order in the order of future potential lives, diseases that have no cure might potentially arise because we have. They have built up an immunity to everything we could throw at them because we decide to spend our antibiotics on agriculture and so on instead of protecting the lives of people. We suspect massively reducing the either the political incentive for countries to do this or the capacity for them to do this by taking away the resources by making them not part of the international organizations anymore would massively benefit these individuals. No, I just want to impact this before we move on to the next part about enjoining trust. The first is that in terms of scale, this is a policy on a chargantuan scale cleaving across hundreds of countries and ensuring that health resources are more adequately allocated and equitably allocated to thousands of the world's most poor. But secondly, in terms of gravity, this deals with some of the most vulnerable, those in rural areas without access to effective health care resources, those who are old and cannot take vaccines and rely on herd immunity. These are the people we protect. Notably, this also has a secondary benefit we think is equally important in the sense that the creation of a court causes trust to arise and increase overall investment and participation in global health. The authored refrain is that these countries are ineffective. In the sense that they are toothless, even if a relevant organization tells you to do something, you're unlikely to follow it. Moreover, politicians want to be sure that they can hold other politicians to account. So they will likely to manifest their will through this court and moreover, no politician wants to look like they will fear like they will be imprisoned for committing a health crime. Which means that they will also increasingly participate in this court. This means that we have way more money for operations from local forces and participation in this international organization. Which means that we amplify any of the benefits we provide earlier and they seem to be pretty big benefits. The end of this first argument is quite simple. We're closer to saving the world. Secondly, this is also principally important and principally legitimate. We suspect an argument to come out if you might subvert the democratic will of people. There are four reasons why this doesn't happen and notably why there's also principally different thing to do. The first is that this organization is consented to participate in the organization and the ratification of such a treaty and a court. But moreover, they vote in politicians that do the negotiating for them. Secondly, the health care that we propose is a fundamental right that exists as a precondition for the fulfillment of democratic will. If you are dying, if you do not have access to goods, it doesn't matter if you might hypothetically access your will in the future if you are not able to access that because you don't survive. Moreover, an effective baseline in the first place is necessary regardless of whether or not the democratic will is important. States have a responsibility to opt into situations where they allow for the preconditions to that will to exist and manifest in the first place. Fourthly, we also identify that on the balance of rights, even if you fulfill your democratic will as a people, this often comes at the balance or at the cost of other of the democratic rights that other individuals might have. So you as a country, as a Western country, might be okay with having, you know, very not stringent. That's the opposite of that very lax quarantine measures, but people in the surrounding countries who might be harmed by the infections that come out might still not have access to democratic will and might have not consented to that in the first place. There's often very difficult to for countries to face. We all suspect there are two separate principled reasons as for why we think this is very, very good. The first is up on the level of utilitarianism. This deals with benefits on a gigantic scale in the sense that thousands and thousands of people's lives who do not care a whit about democratic will do not care about principled legitimacy without being given access to the lives. But thirdly, this deals with people on a scale or inordinately into the future to say future deaths of pandemics. That is to say future deaths to superbugs from antibiotics, people who would not have to spend massive amounts of money in order to support a government welfare policy in order to support in order to support a basically overburden and basically toppling international health system. We suspect that these benefits are also quite large for three reasons. First is that there's substantially more likely to be people in the future. There are populations growing over time. Secondly, these people have no consent to what happened over the past and as such we have a responsibility to create an international court for these people in the future and thirdly is that we are taking mutually exclusive resources away from them. Which is why we should care for them. There are two reasons why opening government wins this debate. The first is that we explain why we saved the world and secondly we explain why there is no other possible choice. Affirm.

    David tries to preempt why this court is going to look good. Unfortunately, he does it quite generically. But all of the other criminal courts which exist today, including the ICC which controls the implementation of post-conflict reconciliation and things like this, the ICJ which controls the implementation of international law, which presumably countries have the same incentive to have a say in as he says they would. Here are all based on opt-in, opt-out treaties that you can leave out of with no ramifications. The way here is clear. The influence you would have in such a body is quite diluted, insofar as you are only one of the members, specifically augmented by the fact that the countries that are the most likely to not want to comply are the country with the least amount of resources to be able to comply with these regulations, notably less developed countries. Which means that their influence is, in and of itself, a priori smaller. Therefore, the risk of persecution is more approximate and more likely than you having influence, which means it is incredibly likely. Now, the countries which cause the most harms, as per Opening Government's framing, are also the countries which are going to be likely to want to minimize risk and harm in terms of persecution and not opt into this court. Which means they a priori have a lot less efficiency in achieving their harms. But it also means, on the comparative, that the countries who do opt-in are those who have no trade-off. Those who are able to enforce these policies already, which means two things. One, there's a relatively small delta already. But secondly, it also means that these countries are going to have a disproportional say within the decisions of this court. Before I move on to why that's bad, let's make it clear that there's no analysis from OG as to why this court has the ability to dictate global healthcare policy, it has the ability to prosecute. No analysis on the likelihood of why it's key in providing health resources globally. Why scheme providing access, therefore both their impacts are minimized. But also unclear why the extent of the influence or say that countries would want to have in this court in the first place is likely. What kind of decisions do we think the court is going to make based on the characterization? We provide these are going to be biased and/or irrational decisions. First of all, we think insofar as western countries are the ones that are most likely to have sway due to their political power, but also due to the lowest trade-off of them opting in because they are not getting prosecuted because they have the resources to implement these policies. This means the application of western standards to less developed countries. Not the ability to go into full lockdown is contingent on the development of your economy. On your ability to transition to the internet and online economy, the digitalization of your country. Many countries physically cannot do this and to keep their people alive. They need to balance between lockdown and economy. This is contingent on the ability to finance more expensive studies, very often. You have to breach ethical protocols to develop medicine for things like malaria and dengue if you don't have the resources to do otherwise. You have to finance expensive bureaucracy. You need to have on-the-ground street-level bureaucracy which is going to do oversight of these policies, many developing countries don't have that. What is the weighing here? The weighing is that the many less developed countries have a necessity to breach these policies in order to be able to implement any kind of healthcare policy. Which means that you put in between a rock and a hard place of deciding between prosecution and the health of their people. And if you do efficiently prosecute, you make them less able to implement any healthcare policy in the first place. But secondly, insofar as the countries deciding these policies are those who are least fucked up, I didn't have less knowledge of what is happening on the ground and therefore more likely to implement negative standards because they do not have the oversight of what's going on. But secondly, know that there are both corporate and political interests. Not that the pharmaceutical market is an incredibly competitive one. Which means corporations have a market incentive to push for prosecution of companies or leaders in the developing world for developing specific types of medicine, which may be more accessible or maybe a competition to them generally. But there's also political influence, not too much. We've been cheating on the Chinese vaccine like Sinovac. It's horrible or Russia does not provide, you know, research for their vaccines. Sputnik is incredibly dangerous. Although, by the way, they did. Or Cuba researching four of their vaccines. This means that insofar as governments are just beholden to corporate lobbies, insofar as getting donations from these lobbies is a prerequisite to being able to run a national campaign in the first place and reach your electorate. This means there's going to be a huge amount of political pressure to lobby against companies of countries that are within the developing world and to portray them as having bad standards or is not complying. The consequence of this is that insofar as very often their only way to get healthcare provision to their people is to have this done locally because it reduces shipping costs and reduces dependency on the West. And therefore also the ability of the West to leverage against them. You're removing this from them, which means that insofar as they have a local capacity to control healthcare issues. You're making it worse. So the countries which are already worse off already have a lower amount of resources not just get their people dying. And I think this directly flips the comparative of the Opening Government. What is the comparative of the other side of the house? Not only do they create an incentive for leaders to cover up crises, which is just mitigation to their case insofar as they're going to get less successful persecutions. It also means you incentivize less cooperation with WHO or even countries leaving it. Because what is the comparative? The average citizen within the electorate doesn't know what the WHO does on the ground. The comparative for a leader then is that it is easy for them to formulate a populist narrative of this is another western-centric organization implementing measures against us. Note how countries within the developing world reject the IMF even when its measures are good for them then try to comply with this, which means that they're more likely to leave the WHO because their electorate will not react against this. However, the consequences are going to be quite palpable because you mean it means you get less access to grants, less access to medical trials, less access to medical provisions, less cooperation with NGOs on the ground who are necessary for things like vaccine efforts. Which means that the consequence is twofold again more people die. But secondly, I think you create a perverse trade-off for these countries insofar as they have to either choose between leaving the WHO and not being prosecuted to politician selfish incentives or choosing between not implementing the only policies which work within their countries. I think a clear comparative is here. There are other mechanisms to do this. We can export the generic medicine at low prices. We can earmark development aid on the conditionality that certain conditions are met. We can give them access to specific research grants. We can give them targeted access to patents. Why is this important? Because if there is an incentive, as Opening Government concedes, to solve these healthcare problems, I think that these countries and the West realize it anyway. Which is one why it's likely that the West will do our alternative mechanisms. But secondly, all of the harms positive by OG in terms of superbugs, in terms of antibiotics, the leaders in developing countries or less developed countries are aware that this fucks up their economy. And that shapes the comparative in this debate. Before I move on to why, Closing Government.

    > POI: Do you oppose humanitarian intervention to stop genocide in all cases, considering it is a time selectively used and colored by the politics of great power states?

    I think the answer to that comes in how well it's done or how well it's not done. I've explained what this will be done badly. Moving on to why we think this harms these countries. Not that the countries in the developing world are unaware that they want to solve these problems. The comparative is they often don't have the resources that I've explained. What is the comparative of government? They prosecute the inability to comply with policy. They do not provide a mechanism as to how they make these countries better able to comply with that policy. The alternatives we provide actually enable this and the same mechanisms as to why there's a western incentive to solve these problems. Works as to why the west would do our alternatives, therefore dissolves it better. But they also think the second reason why opting into accord is worse is because I think it reinforces narratives of colonialism and anti-westernism, which makes countries less likely to comply. Leslie, I just think this reduces global buying in health care measures. We currently live in a world where COVID has created an amalgamation of conspiracy theories, living in a dystopia which people were never faced with before has created a huge amount of narratives as to why there is a global enslavement plan. The creation of such a court gives a huge amount of munition to anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Say yes. This is true. They're literally trying to prosecute the people who do not want to execute the global plan. Not how many people did not pick AstraZeneca because black cloths were presented as a plan to cull the global population. Create a global court and you feed into the new world order idiocy. But it's ruining the COVID vaccination plan right now. I am so proud to wear the scarf and to oppose.

    When Australia initiated an inquiry into Pengxu and the Wuhan Institute of Virology to determine the origins of COVID-19, whether or not it was a spillover hypothesis from bats or pangolins, or whether it was a lab leak hypothesis from the largest storage of coronavirus samples in the world, China retaliated with significant sanctions on meat and other basic goods. It is disgusting to see how your life is literally put at risk every single day, on the basis of some concept of democracy or on the basis of some trust towards the state, or on the basis of leaders that you want to be able to elect because you elected them for other benefits, but you didn't elect them on the prospect of you dying. And that is why the threat to killing more individuals is the most important thing in this debate, and we cannot stand for that. That's why justice has to have teeth, and we have that at Gov. I'm going to talk about two things in this debate: number one, why this improves the capacity of the WHO and why the WHO becomes better and better on our side, and secondly, a lot of response to the LO. Firstly, why does this improve the capacity of WHO? Because remember, opposition is going to make the argument that this is the perception of WHO being very elitist, very Western-centric, and not having a lot of funding from many countries because only rich countries fund it. And then many of these things, different things, make it harder for WHO to operate. This specific mechanism, an international court, is going to make the WHO better in capacity in three significant respects. Number one, the litigation process that a leader of opposition was worried about, like the problem of all leader of office that they assume that individuals and leaders will always want to delete evidence. But that's always going to happen at the point in time where the pandemic becomes longer and longer. It's harder for you to track the evidence as the evidence gets buried over time or because the scientists are able to go into hiding. Having the ability to inquire and formalize these investigations very early on, even on the basis of speculation, gives us the pressure to give this data to the WHO. This is the preservation of evidence. More individuals and whistleblowers going to the ICH (this is the International Criminal Court on Health, by the way) because they can get many of these benefits and they can get many of these individuals to buy in. Even opposition parties internal to these countries are also willing to buy in on our side. The ICC is able to do this because it incentivizes like people and communities to overthrow many of the dictators and authoritarians within their countries because they will turn them over, and those same authoritarians are willing to give themselves up because they don't want to die as well. So this is also a symmetric incentive for many of these individuals to buy in. Number two, the pressures. I mean, the example here is the Hague ruling, right? Even if we have like a map of the South China Sea. That's a good thing because for the WHO, that means more data that they can use for other clinical trials in the future. Number two, the pressures on other states to join in also creates an internal check and balance process for to make the WHO more globally representative. So the WHO will have more info on whether or not you can use face masks or whether or not face shields are bad. And you can have more information more and more, like how the WHO did when it learned that COVID was actually airborne. So we're how like even if we have a little bit more hesitant WHO, we're able to fact-check those confirmations more and more, and you don't have to have this back and forth process of whether or not the WHO actually recommends that you should mix these vaccines against each other or vix don't have a third dose or have a fourth dosage because all of these information changes, and that's why we can change this with our process. But three, other countries do want to compete for a seat at the table. So you can leverage over the other these countries like the China versus US debate and their ability to have a vaccine race, which is phenomenal for the distribution of vaccines across the world. So this is also one way the private sector and the public sector cooperate through the WHO, through COVAX, and through the unique distribution that happens because of the International Court. Um, I think a POI from closing opposition.

    > POI: Yeah, we'll not have enough resources as a country or not having enough capacity to follow these regulations. We have sufficient defense in this court.

    Um, so well, it depends on the court, right? But I think it's that the recent instances that we're talking about is if the WHO gives you funding for whether or not you're gonna implement antibiotics or not, and they significantly tell you not to do that, then there is capacity for them not to do that. Right, and I think that's very definitely valid for you to give in that court. Um, Leader of Opposition says that the ICC has failed in any of these instances and it's like to feel in this side too. Um, two responses: number one, health is much more non-partisan and is supported by a vast majority of these communities and other states rather than gore. Crimes being significantly disputed or history being disputed, and number two, we're talking about instances of significant corruption or misuse of WHO funds or even significant like misinformation that is taken away from citizens. In this context, like the Wuhan, um, like the lab leak conspiracy that people do not have information on. LO says that you have to breach protocols to develop these vaccines. I have two responses: number one, this actually can cause significant local distrust within your state because the leader populist leader might think it's a good thing to be able to do a breach of protocol. But it actually makes it worse internally within those states, like for example, the vaccine hesitancy in the Philippines with the dengue vaccine scare because they said we want to have this vaccine rolled out now to be able to stop dengue in our country. But what happened is it caused some side effects for some individuals because it was the FDA approved and approved by WHO. So it caused the spiraling effect of many of these health crises within the country. But number two, even now today, we make less of these circumstances happen in the first place because as much as possible, these courts and trials are going to be given to the ICH. Number three, LO says that you can probably, you can't prosecute people. Like you just literally can't prosecute people because the WHO is never trusted. Two things: number one, if states don't think they will be prosecuted, that is the reason as to why they'll buy in very early on into our policy. And that's why it's like it'd be more effective because they want to give more funds to WHO so that they can be able to implement and prosecute other cases in the future. But number two, now we put teeth to be able to give this court so that more individuals can be punished on our side as well. Hello says that oh, many of these policies are accountable to corporations and maybe these politicians are already bought by them. If that is the case, then you are saying they are indeed subverting the will of the democratic people and they're not doing this for the just interest of those individuals and therefore you have to have a greater principle as to why the state should intervene or why there must be a global crisis. And other regional actors should have a say in this matter. Which is why the democratic will of other states and their public health and safety is also more important in this case. But number two, corporations also want less instability in these instances because we also say that private incentives are there to make vaccines more safe to be able to as much as possible give that when the public safety sector is failing. And that's why you're also able to mitigate those processes on our side. Lastly, Hello says that they can, you know, you know, the use of populist narrative to be able to purport this and these policies in the real world. Number one, they already do that right now. Look at Bolsonaro. Look at the territory using a strongman narrative to implement draconian policies in these nations. I think the reason as to why it's worse on their side is because there's no ability for you to prosecute these leaders in the process right now and during the pandemic or even after the pandemic. So you can get this information. But number two, a lot of this trust is also lost on the WHO on our side because people actually trust doctors more than the police or the military on our model rather than them being able to implement the quarantine restrictions on their side. Hello last says that they can be accountable on their side. Um, I don't think this is true. Number one, the alternatives you posit of targeted access to patents is not much exclusive. We can also implement that on our side if the leaders are also incentivized to, you know, care cater to the will of the people then they will join our model as well. So our model is effective. Thank you everyone.

    No large incentive for domestic government to deal with the pandemic in the best way as it can. As the internal incentives of the country, because there are negative incentives for you if you mess up a trial, if you mismanage a pandemic domestically. Therefore, there is no defense of no resources because the status quo or whatever closing oppositions. Because this is literally the status quo by these countries do not enforce these regulations because if they could, they would want to enforce them because this is politically beneficial domestically. Therefore, the comparative of lying and disclosing on their side of the house, as I recognize, but given that this incentivizes countries to cover up more as the response might be persecution. Recognize, therefore, that the time sensitivity of this argument is very important. If you can fix the cover-up of having digging out bodies in crimes against humanity if it happens. Comparatively, if the pandemic is mismanaged and covered up and you can't ask for international help because you are going to be, then this is a problem which tears down a huge part of opening government's case. But recognize on the courts, they have no fiat to say what the courts will look like. The consequences of opt-out are largely developed in thin speech. They have very little responses to this. Biases internal pressure by richer countries and corporations are also not dealt with, and there is a disproportionate influence of larger and more developed countries for the mechanisms which we outline that there is a higher, there is a lower cost to you opting in comparatively to countries which are not like having these national regulations upheld right now. So look at also the financing of who. I mean, like, yeah, OG recognizes this, but they don't put any sort of counter-argument. If I know the financing that is pulled out by the United States. Like, it's a big problem for who, why they wouldn't have this proportional influence or how this would actually happen. So they're the ones who create norms, but look, I recognize their preemptives here by opening government. I just pointing out that we had a huge amount of argumentation which wasn't responded to as well. But look, even if you buy all of the preemptive that countries have an incentive to opt into these programs to influence them, blah, blah. Just ask yourself, why are they not then opting into similar organizations such as the ICC, such as the WTO like courts and all of this. Recognize that there is no responsiveness to this implementation from our side of the house. But also that large corporations which are forced by national regulations to follow these protocols do not have an incentive to influence the governments and why governments have an incentive to make this political and unrealistic requirements in an effort to boost their domestic production and export of medicines and their pharmaceutical industries as well as their hospitals, research centers, etc. Similarly to what happens with political incentives in similar courts such as the WTO courts or ICC. But it's often not who is right but is this beneficial for the interests of the United States to try and serve or not? Is it beneficial to increase the tariffs of steel or not in the WTO regulation but also on increasing global healthcare benefits? Recognize there are largely three reasons why countries which do not abide by this are doing this in the status quo because they recognize that there are global benefits to following this. Because first of all, there's a collective action problem. Secondly, they might be undercutting regulation for their own benefit and thirdly the costs are too high. Recognize that countries who are richer can offset and do indeed trade off these things efficiently with safety in the status quo such as we call it. But there are more stringent rules, but also other policies as climate change. The problem is that countries which are less rich do not have the ability to do so. Therefore, the characterization is that the countries most affected are unable to follow the protocol. Or there are high trade-offs that they are facing when following the protocols and they are prioritizing their own well-being as opposed to the well-being of the global community. But recognize given that their own well-being is a bigger benefit for them than the spill-off effect of the big international global benefit. This largely benefits the richer countries which do not have these internal costs but have the external benefits of less antibiotics used, etc., etc. So the comparative here is that they are unable to conduct high standard trials, unable to educate and introduce enough measures to reduce antibiotics usage because of less hygiene conditions in their hospitals, because of a less educated population, because of less availability to diagnose differential treatments and disease such as if this is viral or bacterial. So this is a huge part of the reason why they are doing so and not to try to undercut costs in a large amount of circumstances or because they cannot solve the collective action problem. But rather because they have the incentive to basically benefit their population. But also recognize therefore that this is very important. Please note that there are negative consequences for your country if you engage in this, right? I mean already proved this they don't dispute this therefore the trade-off here is that the external costs to other countries is the one which you de-prioritize so that you prioritize your internal well-being. Why is this legitimate and countries are allowed to do this? Because the opposite thing happened that gave them the upper hand which they are using right now. So for example development of medical industry pharmaceutical industry and the economy was oftentimes contingent on the not internalizing the negative effects to other countries. But just looking at your own benefits such as pulling doctors and researchers from developing countries so that they go to develop countries over there controlling the medicine market. Industrial development that polluted these countries and the globe while they were still being underdeveloped the exporting of instability for internal political purposes and things like this the monopolization of the pharmaceutical market. So it is in very essence the same things which developing countries are trading off now which the developed countries were trading off in before and this is why in the end they got to a position where they basically would do this and they are in in a position to do so right now. But also the comparative from opening government is the one with more stick but less carrot because they don't prove that it is enough to actually make countries enforce the policies. But this also decreases the incentives for countries to nudge and offer carrots to countries to do this. Which is where I'm going to go engage next, but I want to take a POI from CG.

    > POI: Well, he says you stay because you want help from the WHO. OO says you leave because you don't want to get punished. Why isn't the obvious answer here to prevent this situation in the first place by creating global political buy-in for prevention strategies for the next pandemic?

    Look, this is what I'm going to come to next, but recognize that it's not so black and white. Some countries might stay, some countries might leave, but the problem is that you are making them unable to do the trade of which they are making right now, which is in their interest. That's the bottom line. What are the negative consequences? Is there a way in which we can increase the compliance of these things in status quo without the court joint finding processes, cooperation with WHO, removing IP and patent laws that benefit developing world, sustainable development goals by U.N., and development aid that is connected to increasing compliance compared to here? But this is more expensive and has a bigger cost that is incurred by developed countries in the status quo compared to just making regulations, which means that you can prosecute it if you do not comply with it. Therefore, this has all of the incentives, both internally but also in a way which is easier from your perspective as a developed country to use this more often than the ways which are more costly to enforce the compliance of developing countries. Therefore, this is a comparative in which we prove that this is beneficial, basically in a way on how you can achieve some of this sustainably with more costs for developed countries, less cost for developing countries. So, thank you, folks.

    Oo's counterfactual is, we want to remove IP laws, we want to give more money to these organizations; and I have just one response to this. I don't see why we can't do any of this stuff. But I'm going to flip this point and argue that we actually have more political capital to take away all of these sorts of stringent regulations to increase the capacity of developing countries to fight pandemics. Because of one very simple reason, guys, and this is why COSBOI becomes important. Because at the point at which countries can provide defenses that say, "Aha, we didn't have capacity, guys. We can't fight the virus. We can't afford the vaccine." This means that the WHO is under immense public scrutiny from across the world for not implementing these capacity-related policies, so we get much more political buy-in on our side of the house. With the WHO is explicitly attacked within the media, within policy circles, by country representatives within the UN themselves, to do this. So, that's the first thing. I have three extraneous responses to those material over here in terms of, and then I'll go straight into our positive material. The first thing is with this idea of withdrawal, I just want to note that withdrawal from this organization is extremely likely for a couple of reasons. One, you know, COVID is a mass event. You can't just say this wasn't an event. So that's happened, millions of them across the world economies for the first time in a while. We're just not working at all, so some countries are under immense pressure to do something about this. Secondly, media, academics, think tanks. Everybody is scrutinizing country policy or state-level policy over there. So you have more scrutiny there. This is reflective of the fact that even China allowed the limited inspection still from the WHO. In later on, Biden got elected, and Biden's made lots of promises, especially with the COAX sort of stuff, and just with regards to developing countries, I want to note. Developing countries rely on the WHO not only for the COAX measure and to fight the current pandemic, but they also rely on the WHO for things like polio vaccines and other sorts of mini-epidemics that are happening across the world. So it's really unlikely that they're going to be able to withdraw from this. I'm going to take the best-case scenario from opposition and say, this court is going to be extremely biased against the developing world and still prove why we take this debate over them. Okay, before that, one specific piece of framing over why there is compliance. First of all, I just want to note that, you know, you depend on them to some degree, but also want to note the specific mechanism about leaders that OG misses. Is that the sanctions are personal when other sorts of sanctions like ICC sanctions or UNSC sanctions come up? Leaders are much more willing to take them on because they displace, uh, you know, the impacts of the sanctions on the population. These sorts of sanctions are directly related to their personal self. And this also means that political parties, for instance, can replace them with other candidates, which oftentimes happen. So they want to keep their power and they want to keep, uh, you know, to not be sanctioned. So in terms of this, why are what are we going to do? The first thing we say is within the developing world, we have the ability now to uniquely displace discursive blame on the WHO and Western organizations to implement policies that are thoroughly unpopular but are widely necessary. The second thing I'm going to talk about is why we get prospective attention to healthcare. Hamza's POI and why we are much better at just making policy to prevent pandemics coming from the first place. So compliance isn't even a metric in this debate. Okay, let's talk about displacing, uh, displacing blame. I want to note that OG is right that there are lots of incentives why countries want to combat COVID, but for developing countries in specific, they are competing incentives on the other side for why they can't introduce very stringent policies. Look at lockdowns in India. You can't do that because your economy is reliant on mass transport of labor, and your laborers are reliant on their daily jobs. So there's an economic incentive for the country to not comply to the WHO. Also, look at cultural practices like Eid across the world where it is impossible for Muslim countries to say, "Don't do Eid celebrations. Don't go to the mosques," because it means that they will never get buying. So this is why in the status quo in OP's world, you never get these kinds of stringent policies, even though you have overall broad incentives to want to take down the virus. What do we crucially do? We give these countries the ability to say the WHO is forcing us, the Western world is forcing us. So they take away all sorts of accountability. They're not going to be harmed in future elections or by internal policy think tanks or whatever, for this sort of stuff. Why is this crucial then? Because we agree with OP, developing countries are extremely important because developing countries are likely going to be the sites of future pandemics coming up. In the first place, there are three structural reasons for this. One, regulatory mechanisms with regards to healthcare are extremely weak within developing countries. Secondly, mass public knowledge does not exist with regards to how to combat disease and how to get treatment. Thirdly, your cultural practices sometimes increase, you know, virus, etc. Again, like, you know, going to a mosque and then exposing the virus to lots of people. So your cultural practices increase this. I want to note that even if we are biased extremely against developing countries, the fact that developing countries are going to be the ones that are harmed also means that in the future, these countries or other sets of developing countries are unlikely to want to go for, you know, lax policies and so on and so forth. And I just want to note, we just want one developing country to be like, you know, biasedly screwed over by the WHO. One developing country informs the rational decision-making of state leaders of other developing countries. This is what happens when one country goes down. We are exposed to the same kinds of risk. And why is this crucial? I'll get to that before I take the POI.

    > POI: Stopping pandemics locally is an interest globally because you don't want them to spread. Insofar as that's true, where you have a bigger incentive for countries to comply, we actually give them a carrot with mechanisms.

    It's great. It's great. It's great. I agree. I told you why we get more carrots on our side. First point of framing in my speech. But secondly, I want to note again, it's a short-term bias, right? You don't know when the future pandemic is going to hit or whatever. So you don't do prospective policy making. And again, you still want to keep power for the cultural reasons sector. I have focused on lots of Muslims would rather lose their lives than not be able to pray and so on and so forth. So people in these countries actually do make these calculations. Okay. Why is this crucial? Because one, I want to note you need developing countries to prevent future pandemics because again, the virus doesn't know borders. So one country hit means other countries will be hit. Next point, I want to talk about prospective attention to health care. There are competing narratives again, like there's an additional incentive we've added for leaders, which is personal liability now. So, but leaders are thinking, "Aha, if we don't do these sorts of policies, what will happen is we will personally be taken to court? We will personally go to jail or be sanctioned or so on and so forth." Why is this crucial then? Because now there are issues that are low on voter issues, right? Like the fact that you need to invest in health care or future policy or research. All these sorts of things are long term. Voters don't care about them. But leaders now have incentives and global buy-in now to invest in these sorts of practices, to invest in research, to invest in making vaccines, to invest in better health care policies because what they fear is being in the when the next pandemic hits. That the fact that they are going to be prosecuted. And this is crucial because one, I want to note in developing countries, the response to the pandemic has been pump everyone with antibiotics. And the problem with that is we are creating the next super germ because they are going to be resistant to any sort of antibiotics that we have. So we want prospective policy now to prevent future pandemics, will also prevent the fact that another super germ is going to come up. And at that point, nobody's going to care. For all these reasons, very proud to propose.

    This debate cannot be won in the fringes, i.e. OO cannot win the debate by just saying that all countries will pull out and therefore there is no net effect. Nor do I think that you can say that the people who do not have the capacity do not have a fair defense. I will engage the best case on government bench where there is significant buy-in, where this significantly changes the capacity of the WHO to operate and therefore makes the response to health crises worse. I'll argue two things. Firstly, I want to talk about the risk of prosecution and note it is the specific incentives of leaders that this debate must be won on, as opposed to general claims about international institutions and therefore are going to make the WHO operate less effectively. And I want to note that there's the preemptive interest for countries to change the legal standards by which they can be held liable on their side of the house because the incredibly stringent and incredibly effective measures that government bench might want are threats to their power, our future threats to their capacity to operate. The first thing I want to note is just that a lot of WHO standards are currently not the best and therefore just having this method of enforcement and legal enforcement is not always effective. I.e. they said COVID was a flu but at the same time put incredibly stringent methods of locking down on H1N1. Why is this the case? It is because uniquely with health crises, you have things that be changing nature of information such that the incredibly fast and quick action government wants is not always the best thing to do. You also have the evolving biological nature of disease, which means that with the rise of variants, it changes what regulations are best apt. And therefore it's either you don't act as quickly as government wants you to act, or it's simply not likely to adapt with the times as good as they can. But secondly, I would just argue that we are trending towards making this better by allowing the information and data collection process and the research necessary, um, for the same natural incentives that government wants, i.e. you want to be able to create global buy-in for this, which is not usually exclusive in order to deal with pandemics, etc. How does this change how everyone government bench? Three things. Firstly, you're likely to refuse to research on things like best practices because once you can be legally held binding for such things, it becomes a threat to your power and therefore you're unlikely to want to do this. Secondly, it's defunding things like the nature of a disease so that you can buy as much time as possible to understand your own personal strategy of how to deal with the pandemic and you don't have to defund this within your own state, which can refuse to share that information with other states just that you can have a good strategy to deal with COVID-19. But other states cannot possibly hold you legally liable for not being able to deal with it because they did not know at the time how to be able to do so. But thirdly, it's not just hiding data and evidence as OO suggests. It is refusing to engage in the data collection process and note there was an incredibly large problem with many developing states in the. And I would say it becomes far, far worse on their side of the house because of the inability to collect information and data that makes courts unable as well to be able to gather evidence that could potentially hold you liable, so things like mass testing, things like being able to look at where disease exists, etc. Why is it incredibly dangerous? The first thing this suggests is just that a lot of the regulations you could be held liable for on gov could be potentially terrible, i.e. they could not have potentially adapted at times, i.e. if they did they took way too long as opposed to today where you're not afraid to hold people legally liable and potentially make some recommendations as opposed to the fear and political threat that those kind of recommendations imply on government side of the house. But secondly, because these health issues are global issues insofar as maybe there are local incentives to want to find out more about diseases, we do not want to create global ways to be able to consolidate that information. And therefore, because they cannot kill you legally liable, this significantly deters this kind of global buy-in argument that comes from closing government. And I want to note how important that is because diseases and pandemics are fought in the capacity of countries to work together, share data and information with another, look at the changing nature and how it might affect different states, or looking at how it has uniquely affected their state because it was reached there first as opposed to other states where it's yet to reach. Because you do not want other countries to potentially hold you legally liable, it is either the threat of defunding this research or its complete removal or simply not wanting to share this information. That the short-termist political incentives that government bench says are incredibly terrible also still apply to these leaders and therefore would not want preemptively to allow these legal standards to exist. The second thing I want to talk about is the process of prosecution. Note the only time where you don't have an incentive to solve a large threat to health is when there are overwhelming democratic incentives to do otherwise. The first thing I want to say therefore is that it's unfair. Why health is a priori, i.e. we have the ICC because there is no moral alternative that is possible as opposed to simply trying to stop and prevent genocide. However, with health, there are many developing countries where issues of the economy and lockdowns are incredibly likely to stifle them fundamentally or where there is a large like concentration, not concentration, but there are many people that exist with rural areas and therefore the spread of disease and the threat of epidemic is not to the same degree as it might be globally. What this proves is that absent the ability to say that these are a priori values, especially in times of pandemic and large global health crises where it's incredibly difficult to make decisions where as leaders who are constrained by your own populace, it is therefore unclear why you ought to be held legally liable for this, nor why it is fair for the people who clearly have other priorities and interests. And I don't think gov bench can say at all instances health is the only thing that matters to specific groups of people why that is fair. Secondly, they say this place is blamed. This is terrible because if it is not your fault, number one, you cannot accept any kind of legal accountability. But secondly, it is also just not within your political interest because if you can say that is the fault of other states, it is the fault of the WHO. Therefore, this is no longer a winning political battle for you to want to invest in being able to solve these kinds of pandemics. In fact, I would argue it is either by overblowing the importance of other things which now balances it out of power or denying the disease, saying it is not true, saying that we cannot engage in this process because other countries have forced it on us. And therefore changes their fundamental political incentives. I'll take the POI from OG.

    > POI: Your carrot of data collection or OO's money requires resources, which has to be established. States are unwilling to provide without assurance. Whereas on your side, you somehow rely on leaders covering the crises of national import, which sounds like something we make illegal anyway.

    So, the first thing I want to note is this: characterization assumes their best case where there's a degree of capacity and therefore resources exist. Therefore, that's probably the biggest delta in the debate because on either side, the countries that are completely unable, it's unclear whether or not there's net action that exists, nor whether or not they have the capacity to change these WHO standards. Lastly, you fundamentally incapacitate leaders who are most needed at this time. Note that most ICC trials exist after the humanitarian crisis. There are two options on government bench. Number one is you allow these trials to exist at the period of crisis that not only stop these people from operating, but number two, look at how ICC trials often go. People do not just show up and allow themselves to be imprisoned. A lot of the time, they hide in other states that are going to allow them to seek refuge. A lot of the time, they do not want to be legally found and caught to be able to ensure that the WHO and this new court is able to take them out of their power. So what I would note here is that you fundamentally make states sitting ducks, especially if you want to access this benefit at the start of pandemics where it is most crucial for action to occur. What this proves then is that either you change these standards of the WHO and any system of enforcement on gov enforces incredibly terrible laws, or that you're simply unable to meaningfully do this. I genuinely have never been so lucky and so proud to oppose in this debate. Thank you, everyone.

    This debate can only occur if a pandemic happens. If a pandemic happens and the leader does not correspond to the incentives of the WHO, either on Opening Government side, they stay within the WHO because they have corollary incentives, or on OHO side, they withdraw. This uniquely shows to you that you prevent the next pandemic from occurring in the first place because both sides have incentives to do so. You don't want to be punished by the WHO and create an international mess. But you also want the WHO on your side, which means that you have global political buy-in for prevention strategies. This had no response from Closing Opposition and panel. I cannot stress enough the impact of this extension. This means that after COVID-19, if we can even delay the next pandemic by 20 or 30 years, that's millions, potentially tens of millions, lives saved in our world. The first thing that I want to do is about the intuition about preemptive legal measures. On this note, that this relies on the same mechanisms as Opening Opposition. It's only at the impact is legal reframing as opposed to hiding data. Secondarily, this doesn't respond to our prevention stuff, which is that why would you preemptively regulate and change and deregulate the WHO as opposed to being like, "Guys, let's not get in this situation in the first place." So just funnel in billions of dollars across the world into stopping the next pandemic. So that we never even have to have this debate in the first place. Which means our extension occurs upstream of what Closing Opposition is talking about. Secondly, this completely contradicts Opening Opposition's analysis. Whereas their analysis was that developing world countries will have incentives to impose very, very harsh regulations on the poor world, whereas their analysis is no, everyone will get together and then they will deregulate the WHO. I can only possibly respond to one. That's a classic double burden that they're putting on Government Bench. But finally, what I want to say here is that about the health priority argument, you know, why health can be solved in other ways? The first thing I want to point out is a genocide only occurs within one state, whereas health occurs everywhere. So if anything, the ICC is actually less important than the WHO here because the impact scale if Modi kills 100 million people in India, he might also by proxy kill a billion people across the world by letting the Delta variant spread. Secondly, I want to make a principal response here. You don't choose to be born in Nairobi. You don't choose to be born in Lahore. You choose to be born where you were born, wherever you're born, right? You're not, why are you victim to your state's incompetence? And if your state is consistently incompetent in making you unsafe, then the international community has to step in, protect your right to health, and make sure that your right to life is also consequently protected. The first thing I want to do is vs off against Opening Opposition. The first thing here, which I think is really, really important, is this intuition about how states will withdraw. Firstly, I've already shared to you that the obvious incentive here is not to withdraw but to prevent a situation where you would want to withdraw in the first place. So our argument occurs upstream of Opening Opposition. But secondly, you know what we say, fair enough. Even if states have incentives to withdraw, primarily because they'll blame like these Western governments, all of that stuff. That's a reason to enforce mechanisms. That's precisely what they miss from our side because now Pakistan does this all the time, by the way. Whenever they have to instate mean monetary policy that no one likes, they'll be like, "We have to do it because the IMF said so, we're really sorry guys." These guys are really evil. That's to America. We want that stuff on our side. That's great. We want domestic governments to blame foreign institutions as much as possible because it's only then that the leaders have incentives to be very, very responsible, very, very stringent with lockdowns because the endpoint blame isn't going towards them. The endpoint blame is going towards this foreign demonic organization. Which means that on the two-level game, this means between the state and the international organization, we're much more likely to get enforcement. But finally, we say to Opening Opposition, let's say that only the developed world criticizes only the developing world. The Hart completely frames this out. He's like most pandemics come from the poor world, guys. I'm happy to say that he gave you several structural mechanisms for this. A, the complete lack of regulation in these places. B, a lack of public health awareness, but three, and I'm sorry, this will sound problematic. But the inherent tie between such certain cultural practices and pandemic spread. This looks like, for instance, vet markets in China are being responsible for two of our largest pandemics in the last three decades. This looks like Ebola practices leading to zoonotic virus spread insofar as they eat many animals within Sierra Leone, which just lead to zoonotic virus spread. I don't know how else to say this. So even if we are only prosecuting the poor world, that's a lot more pandemic stop in the future insofar as that's where most of the pandemics come from, guys. So we assume all of the analysis is true and still win on the OHO counterfactual. One, if you want to funnel in billions of dollars into the developing world, be my guest. In fact, I will do it with you because that's completely symmetric. But two, that shows you something very unique. He says we completely agree and this responds to CEO as well. Legal capacity is a thing. I can't go to jail for committing a crime if I didn't have the capacity and I couldn't help but not commit the crime. Right, that's literally true. So the WHO will consistently lose court cases on our side unless it funnels in the money. This is really, really important. So we create unique political buyer on our side to make sure the WHO's ass is covered. By the point at which it does deregulate vaccines, it does ensure the global buying of public health awareness, and it does funnel in money and technical expertise. Because that's the only way it stands a chance on winning these cases in the first place. Before I weigh all of this against OG, yeah, go ahead.

    > POI: Even though this debate is not just about pandemics today, we see visceral images of bodies dying in Covid in India and Brazil. We know if we don't stop this, the pandemic will continue globally.

    This is really interesting because the intuition pump here is that the OG policy is not needed because there is no need. It's classic World Schools debating. There are two responses to this. The first response to this is if this is true, we just don't prosecute people. Like, we're not compelled to prosecute people left, right, and center, right? So if countries have structural reasons to have responsible behavior in the first place, then prosecution literally never occurs. And this is why OG tries to straw man both sides on government bench, right? You prosecute left, right, and center. It'll be terrible. Countries are responsibly behaving. Anyway, if countries are responsibly behaving anyway, then we literally won't prosecute anyone. I mean, by the way, I also secondly want to point out to the response to POI. The info slide literally says mass health crime violations. We're literally talking about you doing something extremely horrible. It's not like countries slightly screw up and they're like, "Well, gotta go." Because you did this. If they are structural incentives to improve your behaviors, you will do that on our side and also our stuff on the counterfactual. Finally, how do we win against Opening Government? A. We win against Opening Government because we don't rely on proving that incentives don't exist to withdraw. We accept O2O's analysis and say incentives do exist to withdraw. But A. You can flip this analysis by showing that you can now blame a foreign actor. Do you create mass capital for prevention strategies which stops future pandemics? Which is not only a lower burden of proof that we have to prove in this debate, but has infinitely more people than Opening Government is. But third and finally, we don't rely on proving that this policy won't be selectively exercised. Even if this policy selectively exercised, panel, what that leads to fundamentally is pandemics being stopped where, unfortunately, they are most likely to come from. The final thing I want to say here then is this intuition about, you know, colonialism causes these pandemic responses, all of that stuff, if that's true. Let's hear it in a public court. Let's have The New York Times talk about it. It's only when Sierra Leone's leaders come out and say the reason we don't have health capacity is because of what the US did a century ago is when this stuff is talked about in the public courtroom. Whereas right now it's only talked about in balkanized academic spaces. That's when we get more public discourse on the best responsibility towards the rest of the poor world. Panel, you do not choose where to be born. And if your state is compromising your right to health, then the international community has an inherent right to step in in defense of that right. I am so proud to propose.

    A lot of people thank other people. In the round, I'll thank again myself because I'll be incredibly charitable to the proposition team. Know that government's case is quite simple. They say that the standards are good, right, that they are so good. Standards, and therefore, the court is able to enforce these standards and therefore able to get better health outcomes. There are two ways to respond to this. The first is dealing with the issue of enforcement, which everyone else in the round wanted to deal in, suggesting that they're unlikely to buy into the court or people are unlikely to get in. The first thing you want to do down is deal with the CG's case. The first thing they say is, "It's a pandemic and therefore there's a politically opportune time to make people think about the policies that exist right now." Even if you believe this to be true, there is a time limit to this benefit because over 20 or 10-30 years from now when the pandemic becomes a far-off memory for a lot of individuals, the political incentives that they identify are likely to buy out. And therefore, the incentives to pull out from this by leaders who are afraid of potential prosecution in the future increase significantly. That means that is why even if countries sign into the ICC, for example, later on making politically inconvenient for them to do so, they pulled out (cf. the Philippines when they did pull out to the ICC). The second thing I want to note here, however, is that even if you believe that the political nature is highly like talking about the pandemic right now, that doesn't prove that they care about international institutions as a solution to the pandemic. In fact, a lot of countries blame international institutions or try to deal it to the vice. And say they're the problem or blame other countries like pointing to China or pointing to any other country in the world so that they're able to remove blame. So it's unclear whether people are actually in favor of global cooperation as opposed to more ultra-nationalistic sentiments to suggest we have to close off our borders and cooperate with other people because of potential threats. So just saying at the time of COVID and therefore able to pass policies to become successful, it's not sufficient for closing government. The second mechanism they provide this, ah, this gives leaders a mechanism because now they can say, "We're not doing it because we want to, we're doing it because we're forced by the international community." One, this assumes that people being forced and following international guidelines when they don't want to do so is politically acceptable for a lot of individuals with a lot of leaders being strongman individuals looking like you have to kowtow to international institutions. It's actually more politically unpopular and therefore less likely to support it. Secondly, it assumes that you have an innate desire to pursue the policy in the first place and they're just not doing it. So insofar as you're afraid of prosecution, it's unclear why they have an innate desire as a leader to participate in these policies in the very first place. The last major claim coming from closing government is we're able to create prospective policy and that will be a nicely clash their arguments on standards and why standards become significantly worse under the eyes of the house. But before that, I want to deal then with the opening government mechanisms and enforcement. So the problem with opening government is they list a lot of reasons why you might want to participate in international cooperation. But note that all of these benefits are macro benefits to the state. That is to say things like economic aid, economic trade, being able to access things like vaccines with who will benefit your state, which is indirectly beneficial to an individual leader because you only care about that insofar as it makes you politically accepted or political outcomes. The potential threat of prosecution, however, to you directly as a leader is a direct harm on yourself. And that's why it's a significantly more important swaying mechanism. So even if opening government is correct, there's some reasons as to why leaders would want to opt into it. The fact that you can be put in jail is probably a greater reason than any other of this because of the nickel-nuanced incentives of political leaders. That's why it's unlikely for you to get enforcement that opening government and closing government tries to argue. But before that, OG.

    > POI: If countries are afraid of accidentally being blamed for discovering some more new health resource research, they must be more afraid of deliberate action to hide evidence and prevent research. But at least our side has some way to find out the truth and mete out assurance.

    So, I know it's like lame to say, "I'll respond to that later," but I significantly promise that I will prove to you why that response to Opening Opposition, but not Closing Opposition, okay? The second thing then is, even if you believe that you get enforcement under their side, you have to assume that the standards that you're enforcing are actually good. And that was something the Closing Opposition's case was able to challenge. Firstly, we explain to you that the current standards of the WHO right now are even clear to be the best. And a lot of times, they're more problematic. Note that the WHO flip-flop on their standards on masks, for example. And you point out that because of the different local contexts of different regions, it's unclear whether or not it's actually a good thing to have a universalized policy that applies to all, as opposed to trusting leaders to care most about the best for their people. In which case, you're holding people accountable to standards that might even make the country worse. That's not only principally unjustified, but if your policy works, that makes far worse outcomes under their side of the house. Note there are zero materials from the government bench while the WHO or all these experts that they claim are the best arbiters of truth and the solutions that they want to have under their side, but secondly, and this is where we become very, very charitable. Even if you believe that the standards are good right now, what CG barely responds to is a claim that it will make the standards worse and therefore your global consent is worse as well. Firstly, we point out that right now, and this is how I respond to the Opening Opposition POI, you have an incentive to one, not research on best practices because you want to have a lot of these best practices you're held onto. Secondly, you might even have the perverse incentive to research on countering a lot of the best practices. Trying to counter knowledge on whether or not it is good to have a lot of the antibiotics, for example, because it might be politically practical for you or to justify why you need to have a lot of experiments and challenge the ethical standards of experiments. These things exist and work in Closing Opposition because they are not going to be prosecuted by this policy. So OG might be correct that you'll prosecute people for deliberately hiding information during a pandemic. But in the discussion of standards, you ought to have to be democratic. Because if not, presumably the standards will not evolve under their side. And therefore, this is a time where it's crucial for us to be able to develop as much information as possible that you deny the incentive for them to do so under their side of the house. Which means that you might have global buy-in to standards, but the standards are unlikely to become effective or good. You're likely to have them watered down significantly. The comparative under our side is insofar as there are some countries that care about WHO protocols or want to follow a lot of information that exists under their side, that incentive still exists. But at least we're able to have the best information and develop the best practice as possible under our side of the house. But secondly, even if you're not able to successfully challenge the standards by threatening to pull out funding, for example, the fact that they're trying to doing things like misinformation campaigns, for example, prior to the pandemic is the harm that we want to identify under our side of the house. Why do we then beat the Opening Opposition? OO's large case is hinged on people not buying into this. Even if you believe that people buy into this policy, we're likely to be able to win under their side of the house. But secondly, we engage even beyond poor countries. What is the only response that's coming from COO? The first is to say it's the same as OO, I just prove why it's different. Secondly, they say it's contradictory to OO because they suggest that OO suggested that they'll impose stringent policies. If you listen to OO, they suggested that the ICH will impose a lot of the policies that are very, very stringent. And that's why the developing countries are likely to respond by trying to pull down these standards and destroying the global consensus on what standards ought to be. The last thing they then say is, "Ah, it's okay to deal with the developing world." Our case does not work only in the developing world. China or the United States have their own incentives to develop like bioweapons, for example. And presumably, they also have an incentive to change a lot of the standards. The problem in this debate is that they assume that these standards are good. COO pointed the reality. And that's why we're very proud to take this championship. Thank you.

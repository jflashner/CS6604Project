    I think it's largely due to COVID and other things that have happened in the very immediate past, but we think at the same time there's an end to the COVID pandemic in sight, with massively increasing vaccination rates, and the economy is largely on track to recovery. We think that given these circumstances, it is simply irresponsible of the United States government to finance these projects through large-scale fiscal stimuli that are going to create massive debt and inflation for the economy going into the long term, and we just don't think this is the most efficient thing to do either. What do we stand for on opening government? We don't stand by these government projects being funded through fiscal stimulus, whether that be taking on debt or printing more money. We will explain the harms of both of those things. Instead, we would like the government to take policies such as monetary policy that encourage businesses to invest going into the future, so there's sustainable private sector-led growth going into the long term. There are lots of technical aspects to this. This can be, for example, like increasing the credit that banks can get from the Federal Reserve, decreasing interbank rates, decreasing credit requirements for banks, and also increasing costs that it takes banks to park money at the Federal Reserve, with the goal of lowering interest rates for companies so they are more able to invest. So we're going to put four things at opening government. The first is the type of projects that are going to be funded under opposition, why they are not useful. The second is why private companies in our comparatives are better. Thirdly on debt, and fourthly on inflation. I'll take the clarification.

    > POI: Do you support the creation of projects symmetrically in this debate but through other means or do you conceive that there won't be projects on your side of the house?

    We don't support these kinds of government-led projects through these kinds of funding mechanism. First substantive then about the types of projects that you're likely to get under opposition and why this is not likely to be helpful. I will note here for a couple of reasons that the projects that we're going to get under OP are probably not like infrastructure projects or investments that are going to increase long-term productivity of the economy but rather very short-term spending such as just funding more money into defence or just giving money directly to companies. I think this is likely for a couple of reasons. The first is the immediacy of the benefit that you get when you like just spend more money as a government instead of on very short-term causes rather than long-term causes. In particular for infrastructure spending this is a very difficult decision for like governments to make like this is why infrastructure has been systemically underfunded for years and years because the results of infrastructure spending only come to light when the infrastructure is complete given that these are massive large-scale projects that are probably 5-10 years down the line when there's a new administration and they get the credit instead of you but worse in the short term these projects are massively unpopular because deadlines aren't met, they're hugely expensive, construction and destruction are unpopular and people don't see that immediate benefit. I think this is very important given the context of COVID where people are struggling and they want to see immediate benefit to their lives. So for those reasons we don't think infrastructure is likely. We think comparatively you're more likely to spend this money on things like defence or just like subsidising companies etc because that gives you the immediate benefits that you can reap politically noting that the United States has elections very quickly like every two years you have midterms, every four years you have presidential election and so on. But secondly I think there's just a large degree of lobbying captured the US government and so far that like everyone has to run ads and have a very strong political campaign that's expensive in order to be elected in the first place. That's why we see like lots of politicians United States and Congress being very much beholden to these corporate lobbies because of their dependence on them in order to remain prominent after their local communities in order to be elected. I think that shows you then the projects that you get on the opposition side are probably not like intelligent long-term investments in the productivity of the economy but rather very short-term things that don't provide the same level of benefits. Why are the inter-private companies better? I would note the first thing is we think that the context is that we are recovering from COVID and companies have more and more like incentive to invest. There's like lots of reasons for this. The first is that vaccination rates in the United States are very high internationally. It's like 40-50% of people are vaccinated and that's growing. That means that states in most cases are not going to be entering into damaging new lockdowns and there is that certainty that businesses have in order for them to invest. And these circumstances they look they're looking for things like capital right. So in order to get that all of the monetary policy mechanisms that we just described you means that banks are more willing to lend money to these businesses and they are more able to use this capital to invest in their projects and making their businesses stronger. Why do we think that private business is better than government in terms of that? I think the first thing to note here is that these are private companies that are ultimately going to be responsible for their decisions. If you're getting a loan from a bank, if that fails your business is going to suffer. If that succeeds you are going to reap all of those benefits. That's why also we think companies are most proximate and therefore more able to identify exactly what is best, most profitable and most useful for them. I think comparatively like in the case of government funding you have incentives like screw things up or delay your infrastructure project or whatever because then you're just able to squeeze more money out of the government. But also the government spending in and of itself isn't as efficient because it's spent on like political things rather than the things that are most economically beneficial. Before I move on to debt and inflation, CO.

    > POI: Didn't you say that your alternative is giving money to companies and then you said the negative case is giving money to companies. How is your case not symmetrical in the debate?

    We're not giving money to companies. We're using sophisticated tools of monetary and other policy in order to increase the amount of money that banks loan to companies so they can invest. That's like what you get in terms of private sector growth instead of government, artificial government driven growth they could get on opposition. Then on debt, why is this really important? I would like firstly to context that the United States has a massive national debt about 20 trillion dollars. That's like over a hundred percent of GDP at the moment. It's only sustainable under the status quo because we've had record low interest rates. I think that interest rates are inevitably going to rise in the future if you look at history but also just like if you continue pumping money into the economy in terms of government stimulus then people are going to demand more. It's also increasing our needs that the United States isn't necessarily going to repay all of this money so investors are going to demand more interest etc. I think even any marginal increase in the interest rates that governments have to pay in order to service their national debts is incredibly harmful in this debate. Why is this? The first is that this is a massive amount of money so any marginal increase in interest rates is going to mean that a lot more of your annual budget is going towards interest repayments. I think the United States spends maybe 10-20 percent of its national budget on this at the moment. If interest rates go from 1% to 4% that's going to triple to 50% of the national budget. This is clearly unsustainable because it cripples the ability of the government to spend on literally anything like social services etc. The point at which a significant proportion of their budget has to go towards paying debt repayments and that kind of thing. I think this is probably the most important impact in this debate because it's literally existential to the ability of the government to provide these services. I would note that these services are essential to lots of people in society including the most vulnerable people within society and therefore we ought to care about them. My partner will elaborate more on inflation. I think at the end of this debate there's a clear comparative between inefficient politically motivated government-led growth and effective long-term private sector growth that we're happy to stand for on opening government.

    ... Secondly, I want to talk a bit about economics. Thirdly, I want to talk about politics and fourthly, I want to talk a bit about the environment. Let's talk about why this is likely to work and get this out of the way very quickly. First of all, I think we can pass this through budget reconciliation. People like Joe Manchin for instance already virtue signal and vote for Democrats because of the fact that there are Republicans from purple constituencies so there's pressure on them to do this and they've already historically voted for Democrats. Secondly, we have six Republicans in favor only four more are needed and given that lots of the stimulus goes towards Republican states we are likely to get them on board. Thirdly, there's already a Republican plan on our side of the house which is like something like 1.4 trillion so we can negotiate with them and even if we don't get the best possible plan we're likely to get lots of money into this plan. And fourthly, I would just note that Republicans have lots of pressure within their states especially because the last time around the government gave away money to people so that they could pay away their rent etc. It was actually a plausibly good thing. Okay, in terms of passing this we are likely to do this. What's it likely to look like? I think opening government is debating an alternative reality where we're going to do defense spending. What for? I don't know what the fuck. But let's talk about what Biden's plan is. Okay, first of all there's a trillion being spent on green tech, there's 2 trillion being spent on infrastructure projects, there's 1 trillion being spent on family support and there's 1.5 trillion being spent on job support. That's the explicit plan and that's the plan that they have to attack not like fucking defense spending. Okay, let's talk about economics right now and over here I want to deal with why the counterfactual is much worse before. I think there was a historical consensus called the Reinhart-Rogoff consensus whereby you know there was consensus that debt-to-GDP ratios whenever they went up borrowing costs would go up and then you know inflation would go up so therefore we need to do policies like austerity. There's a couple of things that have happened which mean that this is just like not a popular opinion. That's why no economist in the world has come out against Biden's economic plan. The first of all is like there is ample evidence of spending after economic crises working across the world. Secondly, there was forecasting and analysis whereby after 2008 for instance when Obama did not spend money on the economy, it was shown that it didn't come back as soon as it could. Thirdly, I want to note that economic growth has increased while interest rates have remained low and this is also crucial for their case by the way where they're saying aha we'll do monetary policy. Okay guys, what the fuck with? Like monetary policy relies on inflation rates. Inflation rates are already on historic lows. What are you going to do? Take it to minus 10? I don't know what they're going to do. Fourthly, there's inflation actually in the short run in our world because of short-term supply shocks. In our world when there's an expansion of supply given that we're giving money to these corporations, this inflation is likely to reduce a lot of the impacts they're talking about. Don't go away. Any policy on their side also relies on borrowing costs and inflation going up. So when they're talking about giving subsidies to businesses for instance, that also relies on giving money to businesses. I'm not sure what the counterfactual on their side of the house is. In terms of this, why do we need this right now? The first thing over here is to note the fact that you know COVID-19 is a problem and they are going to lead to a debt crisis. There's a looming debt crisis within the United States of America whereby lots of people do not have the ability to spend on their rent. Like they initially had the money to spend on it after the government gave them some money, but now they don't have it, especially because the government support has fallen. This means that you are likely to have a housing crisis in the future and there's a debt crisis looming anyways. Your companies aren't doing that well anyways. Now here's what we do to solve this problem. First of all, because of COVID-19 there was a clear demand slump. At the point which we give this stimulus, there's a stimulus to boost demand from the consumer side because they're getting money through familial support or through job support. But secondly, also more importantly, you have companies producing more and therefore have the ability to hire more. Companies right now don't have the initial capital. They are relying on companies and the inflation rates, but what about consumers? If consumers wanted the money to buy what companies are producing, they don't get their outcomes on their side of the house. We get that on our side of the house. The third thing very crucially is infrastructure requires mass employment. You need lots of construction workers. So lots of the people who have been not hired got fired because construction was down. All those sorts of people get hired again and we get people on the job line. So that's the first thing to note. In terms of economics, we expand the impact and we allow the economy to come back. So the economy won't naturally come back after COVID goes away. The second thing to note over here is how we protect the most vulnerable. This is crucial because minorities etc. have been the worst affected by COVID. They also relied on welfare previously to just go through and they require more welfare now. So what we're saying is if you don't give this money to these people, they're likely going to be in cycles of poverty where it's not enough for them to be there. And this again goes back to the economic crisis point that I was talking about. If you have lots of people below the poverty line, it's probably not great. But the second thing I want to note is that infrastructure projects directly impact minority communities. One of the reasons why minority communities don't have companies coming in is because there's very low investment within infrastructure within these communities. But Biden's infrastructure plan makes their communities, like connects them to national highways and so on and so forth. The companies have more incentive to go into these communities and do more now, but they also get cheaper access to goods and services. So minorities, the most vulnerable people are better on our side of the house. Okay, let's talk also about the Chinese economy and why we need this to combat China. Otherwise we will be outcompeted. First of all, China was better out of COVID because they dealt with it quicker. Secondly, China's already trying to outsmart you in things like tech. The first thing over here is we need the money, especially to jumpstart our tech economy, which gets lots of money on our side of the house. And secondly, we have investment within green technology, emerging technology, which gives us the ability to compete with China, and so on and so forth. So this is the policy on our side of the house. We're much better able to compete with China and therefore not get outcompeted on the international market. I also want to note lastly, in terms of the economics point, once we give this money, we also have more ability to tax the rich or increase taxes on the rich because they have more money. There's no capacity to do that on their side of the house. Okay, I'll take a closing very quickly.

    > POI: Yeah, uniquely, this financial crisis results from exogenous factors, that is to say pandemic. Can you justify why the US economy won't just continue to bounce back as it already has throughout COVID recovery?

    Yeah, because again, I told you consumers don't have the money to buy your products anymore. You need something to stimulate the economy. This is like, you know, after World War Two, you also wanted to stimulate the economy. World War Two was finished, but that didn't mean you didn't have money. You didn't need money to bring back the economy. Okay, let's talk about the second political aspect. As you can see, like, I think in this debate, it's really, really not controversial to say that Trump is an asshole, like Trump is bad for the economy, but also Trump is bad for minorities, women, people of color, so on and so forth. First of all, lots of people have been disenfranchised by Trump right now. And what we have is Biden being able to come in and give direct benefits to these people. This is great, because one, Biden can frame himself as the hero who brought them out of it. So this isn't like a long term plan that OG is talking about. In the short term, people get immediate benefits. So we don't get right fingers, etc, being elected at the point which the economic disenfranchisement of people is down. Secondly, I would note that Republicans often frame other sorts of issues like red meat, cultural issues, like trans rights, women's rights, etc, etc. So there's a stupid debate on their side of the house. But we circumvent that stupid debate, because we're asking the Republicans to talk about things that also affect their states, and directly workers within their states that they that they care about. So it's politically better for us. Thirdly, we also want to talk about the fact that rural communities that vote for Trump are likely to get access to highways, etc, which also means that we're likely to bring this back. If this doesn't work, we can always blame the Republicans as well, which gives us a great discursive tool. Hamza will talk a bit about the environment for all these reasons. Very proud to oppose.

    One, the majority of my rebuttal to opening opposition will be integrated. But before I get on to that, I want to explain two miscellaneous points of rebuttal. The first is on China. The second is on infrastructure projects and minority communities on China is unclear what the marginal changes here and this is for a couple of reasons. The first is structurally speaking, the Chinese economy is on the edge of collapse within the next decade. The reason for this is twofold. The first is the one China policy has created a undersupply of workers within the Chinese economy, whereas the Chinese economy due to its socialist tendencies have debt obligations to a vast majority and larger base of older people. It is therefore going to have to spend an increasing amount of money on spending like social care and less money on infrastructure investment. Secondly, China just over leveraged itself at the point that it invested massively globally. So for example, investing massively in like failing projects in the BRI sector, or alternatively, on trains that go nowhere for political reasons that nobody takes, empty cities, all of these things have racked up massive debt, and a large, decent percentage of that is domestically owned. So the point that those entities fail, because they're not reaching their repayments, we think that's going to screw over Chinese people the most, and it's going to shrink their incomes, and also their prospects of future wealth, which means that there is going to lead to a unique financial crisis greater than just the average cyclical recession. We don't think that China is a relevant consideration in this debate, especially because the one surviving part of the COVID pandemic and the one sector which did well are the sectors they wanted to talk about the technological sectors like the green space, the fact that Silicon Valley is still massively over leveraged, in fact, to over leverage to the extent that it actually is now allowing the financing of bad ideas at its early stage, because of how many investors are in the market. We don't think this is a relevant point in the debate. Secondly, on infrastructural projects and minorities. I think this ignores the analysis that Andrew gave you about political expediency, because if political expediency and investing in projects because of how you want to win the next election matters, then you're going to invest in those tipping point areas, which are the most likely to yield you the election. So it's the area, Rust Belt areas of Michigan, or of, you know, okay, I can't actually think of another Rust Belt area, or Pennsylvania, which are going to get the majority of investment and majority of pork barreling, as opposed to minority areas, specifically African American and Hispanic areas they wanted to talk about where they see the highest percentage of already Democrat voters. But also notice how if it is true that they do engage in negotiations with Republicans, and that is what has led to this plan, then the specific sites in the Biden plan are probably going to be places where both parties feel that they can get benefit. Those aren't the minority areas that they wanted to talk about. Can somebody just put a time signal in the chat? I did forget to start my timer. I'm really sorry about that. I want to talk about a couple of things in this debate. Cheers. The first is on incomes. I think that the reasons that Andrew gave you, you are unlikely to accrue, to a large extent, a flow of incomes in the way that they described. This is for a couple of reasons. Let's start with the company's analysis that he gave you. Given the COVID pandemic, companies have not had the inflows which have allowed them to facilitate the credit that they have racked up. So they are currently in more negative and precarious positions than they previously were. The reason that this matters is because often when you breach a certain amount of credit obligation, you have to do things like pay back money now, you get immediately higher interest rates, you get stripped of your assets. I think that this is specifically true of the type of companies who they are going to have to hire and subsidise on their side of the house when they're engaging in infrastructure projects. The reason for this is because they operate in the construction sector, which has been hit particularly hard due to the lack of demand, because there have been less things like people feeling confident about their wealth, less things like the buying of houses, and generally the construction sector is a, shall we say, marker for the development and the advancement of the economy. What this means is that they are going to have to do things like tie meeting and financing the credit obligations into the government contracts that they signed under Biden's plan, which means that a lot of the money that they're going to spend on this plan won't actually go towards the projects, they'll go towards financing these companies, towards making their shareholders okay, and towards paying off their CEOs. But even if we accept that money gets towards the projects, and that results in incomes or greater jobs, we don't think that is going to lead to further increases of economic growth and further jobs. This is for a couple of reasons. One, as Andrew describes, inflation erodes the value of real spending. This is especially true for the poorest workers who don't have inflation adjusted incomes. Now, the way that they try to arbitrage this away is by saying, oh, no, but we get investment in infrastructure projects, and therefore we get economic growth in the future. The problem for these individuals is they are short term is because they are living paycheck to paycheck. And therefore they are likely to do things like take up more private debt to finance that. So inflation makes things worse for them in the short term, they don't see the benefit of those infrastructure projects in the long term. And the impact of that for them is that they just take on more private debt. What is our comparative? It is yes, maybe on both sides, those people taking up that debt, but at least on our side, we have a better mechanism for economic growth in the long term. So the benefits that Taha was trying to claim, as in those people will eventually get jobs and be good, are unique to our side of the house, because it is private companies who have that incentive to invest in the economy, at the point that we use our monetary policy tools, which by the way, weren't just interest rates, where all of the things Andrew gave you, the fact they don't understand them doesn't mean they don't exist. Very quickly closing opposition.

    > POI: Why are they firstly mutually exclusive? Secondly, why are they better? You don't prove this sort of thing saying they're sophisticated doesn't isn't equal analysis.

    Sure, they're not mutually exclusive. But insofar as they work, we think that it's ridiculous to take on the harms of this debt to the reason that they work is for the reason that Andrew describes, which is one of the biggest problems coming out of an economic crisis is the willingness of businesses to be the first movers and to invest within the economy starting that that accelerated cycle of investment. What we do is we increase credit requirements for banks themselves at the Fed, so that banks have a take on a higher cost at the point that they save their money, or so that banks are more incentivized to loan money out to businesses and individuals, which gets the private sector of the economy booming in a way that government stimulus work. The final thing I want to talk about is how precarious government and this investment is going to be for a number of reasons. The first is even if they are able to get infrastructural projects, the problem on their side of the house is once those projects are done, people lose their incomes and people lose those jobs. And people know that so they're not going to invest money in the economy, they're going to save that money, and they're not going to see the economic benefits. But worst of all, just weigh up everything they say against all of our analysis, the fact that you now have to make greater trade offs in the future in terms of debt obligations, which means that younger people uniquely get screwed over the fact is the poorest to get her and the middle classes who are okay, because it's the poorest who don't have inflation adjusted incomes, we harm future generations at the point we take on this debt burden, we harm younger people, we harm the poorest workers. we propose.

    I think authority but literally not a single mainstream economist has come out against Biden's infrastructure plan. The debate right now is not whether they should spend but how many trillions five or six. Similarly, Kristalina Georgieva, the chief economist of the IMF similarly said that it's confounding for us that in the last decade, interest rates have stayed historically low, but economic growth has gone up. It's just literally true that this is a good idea. And I blame the CS for this motion. The first thing I want to do is deal with the intuition that it will pass which received no response. And it's going to regurgitate these seasons of CG doesn't strawman them later. If we have budget reconciliation, Manjushri is going to keep saying I want bipartisanship so that he can win his districting and Virginia and then vote for us anyway. He has literally done that for all legislation. BVF six Republicans on our side, we just need four more. Remember, this helps Republican constituents for Taha's analysis as well. But finally, even if it does not pass, they can signal that you people aren't getting jobs because of the Republicans. Finally, their counterfactual is monetary policy. I just want to point out that monetary interest rates are historic lows, like where are you going to go into negative interest rates now? What are you going to do? Sophisticated monetary policy is not a substitutable counterfactual. But finally, I want to say in terms of their counterfactual, if it's true that corporate lobbying is this big, and your solution isn't to use a demand side stimulus, then you're going to do exactly what's worse for your constituents on opening government, which is deregulate the economy. That's what Bush did. That's what Reagan did. Because the way that you get these companies working, as Andrew said, thrive on this private sector economy is to deregulate these industries as much as possible, vis-a-vis the lobbying that they themselves talked about, which worsens all the harms on inequality and versus all the things in terms of economic outcomes. Before I talk about the economy, one extension from my end. The environment is absolutely crucial in this debate. A trillion of this is going towards green technology and environmental development. A, you will never get environmental buy-in unless you couch it within the language of infrastructure. If Biden says tomorrow, let's only spend on the environment, not even Democrats will vote for this, especially people like Manchin. But secondarily speaking, for four years, we've dislocated ourselves from the environmental debate, the point at which the US has engaged in unprecedented environmental destruction under the Trump administration. If you really want to do that typical world schools way up like DPM did, care about the environment in the long term, because it screws all of us, screws the economy and also screws other countries. We uniquely get that money on our side. They don't. The first thing I want to do within the economy is problem identification. And here I find this very interesting. So opening government conceals that companies are doing really horribly. And then C.G.R. in the POI won't the economy bounce back naturally? I mean, you have to engage with one of those, not both. But secondarily, companies are uniquely reliant on long term infrastructure spending. The reason for that is because the last time an infrastructure bill came through in the US of this magnitude was nineteen fucking thirty eight, which means our bridges are crumbling, our electric wiring is crumbling. So if companies rely on infrastructure for transportation, logistical support, then necessarily this is a good spending in the long term. The second thing I want to talk about is in terms of why we're doing this. There are two reasons why we want to have the stimulus plan. The first reason is to do with short term supply shocks. In other words, I concede to C.G.R. This was an artificial stopping of the economy. But what that meant was that when companies aren't producing anymore, what that leads to is them not having money to produce again a year later. The analogy here would be that if I close my store and I'm not selling anything, I don't have the money to sell next year in that corner shop store. What we do is that we stimulate the economy and resolve for the supply shock, the point of which we put in a shit ton of money in the economy. That was the first reason. The second reason that is a problem with COVID-19 is to do with debt arrears. Currently, there are two sorts of arrears that the average consumer in the US has a rent arrears and be mortgage arrears. Both of these were frozen during the COVID-19 pandemic or at least the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. But these debts are haunting them. They are due in August, literally to the point of which these people are financing those debts or worst case going bankrupt. They can't spend on the economy. You need to put money in the pockets of these people in order to stimulate the economy and push the US economy forward. Before I deal with the third claim within the economic stuff, I'm really happy to take closing government. Go ahead.

    > POI: Yeah, obviously, there are many people with savings in the US economy, and there has been stimulus throughout COVID. Specifically, what you have to defend at all is a massive infrastructure spending at this point in time.

    No, no, I agree. But financing dried up like two weeks ago. Don't lie, right? Like, I know it's a bad motion. But don't lie. Like, like all of the COVID relief spending dried up two weeks ago. So people are in the looming debt crisis. I've already responded to this. I'm really sorry. The fourth thing I want to talk about within spending is that Taha uniquely shows you that the only point at which that unique, unique political incentives to raise taxes on the rich is when it's accompanied by a shit ton of infrastructure spending. Otherwise, the Republicans don't vote for this. Joe Manchin does not vote for it either. But secondly, let's concede to the argument. And let's say, you know what, deficit spending is going to lead to a debt crisis. That's when you generate unique political capital to also increase revenue generation. And you do that by taxing people such as Bezos, and hence reducing the inequalities that they talked about. The fifth thing within the economic stuff that I want to talk about is China. And here they had an interesting example, which was the demographic slide means that China is going to reduce in its economic stuff. A, no, that's why they're building foreign markets through the BRI. And two, their biggest advantage is in tech. So if you want to solve the technological gap, then you need to spend trillions within the technological sector. Secondly, even if the Chinese economy is on the verge of collapse 10 years from now, your allies don't trust you as an actor, which is spending correctly. The point at which you start gaining an advantage in the tech sector relative to the rest of the world, not just China, when your allies re-engage with you again. But secondly, note the environmental argument at the top of my speech. They don't trust you right now because you pulled out of the Paris Accord. So independent of just the Chinese concern and concern to the rest of your allies, you signal that these sort of things then matter. Finally, on the political lobbying stuff, the first thing I want to point out here is that they've conceded by not responding to it that getting Trump into office is a bad thing. What do we do? Two really unfortunate but fortunate things happened in the COVID-19 pandemic. A, what happened was that Trump led the presidency while the COVID-19 pandemic was happening, hence his popularity fell. But two, I mean, somewhat suspiciously, the vaccine was literally announced the day after the US president was sworn into office in the form of Joe Biden. Joe Biden has this unique opportunity right now to do something that no president has been able to do before, which is do the complete flip. He was the one of the- he was the COVID president. He was the recession president. The point at which I spend money on you is when you convince these people to come on your side. Why is this important? A, you move away from the ridiculous cultural issues that Republicans have made this about, which hurt minorities. Black lives matter is a hoax. Blue lives matter. Trans people are evil. You move away from that issue when you focus on the soup and potatoes issues that all people care about. How do I put food on the table? How do I get jobs? But secondly, and much more importantly, you move away from the narrative that this election was not won by Biden, because even if they believe that, as long as they have food on the table in a way that they didn't last year, they are much more likely to succeed. Panel, economically, all impacts in this debate on CO have to be contingent on our analysis. But secondly, even politically, we've shown to you, this is feasible to keep an absolute idiot out of office. For those reasons, I am very, very proud to oppose.

    It's twofold. Firstly, COVID is unlike any other recession that occurs. Upon a critical mass of people receiving vaccinations being rich, there is likely to be an extraordinarily immediate recovery. And at the point where there is even a small risk that mass debt financing, or at least, you know, mass infrastructure payments and into the US economy at the point where it is after that recovery takes place, insofar as a lot of these government infrastructure projects can be quite slow to translate to the economy. And that was an extraordinary harm that probably did things like increased inflation, increased interest rates. But secondly, and far more importantly, the United States of America was the financier of the globe and any harm of inflation or interest rates increases that occurred in the US were felt doubly abroad, particularly with respect to developing countries who are the most harmful actor in this debate, who are the most, who are the actors who are the most likely to be harmed in this debate. I mean, three extensions that come from closing government. Firstly, why this is egregious for developing countries. Secondly, why this money is going to be spent extraordinarily unwisely. Thirdly, why the context of the inflationary risk that exists in the US presently is extraordinarily bad. Firstly, let's explain why this is extremely harmful for developing countries. Note that if there is greater demand for goods and services that exist within the US, which is what is required for an opposition bench to even win this debate, insofar as that only occurs at the point where these payments get through to people, then this probably leads to capacity constraints and causes for higher inflation. As our opening government point out, what opening government do not point out is that it is therefore extremely likely that the Federal Reserve is forced to increase interest rates, noting that the Federal Reserve acts independently of the administration that is in charge of the US of the day, meaning you inevitably get interest rate rises that occur. Opening government flag interest rate rises as things that occur. They don't do anything with it. What are the three harms of interest rate rises, particularly noting that they're going to be felt abroad? Firstly, any debts that countries have denominated against the US dollar, which was most fucking debts around the entire globe, they now find extraordinarily hard to pay off. Secondly, and more egregiously, countries now find it extremely difficult to borrow against the US dollar. Those two things were extraordinarily, gargantuanly harmful, because firstly, these developing countries were already under immense pressures from the pandemic existing in the first place. They've already gone into debt, had as much borrowings as they can in many circumstances to do things like vaccine procurement in the first place. It's extremely likely that these developing countries, who are the countries, note, that are going to take the longest to actually recover from COVID, will not have the capacity to borrow anymore. That will absolutely obliterate their economies. But the third extraordinary harm with respect to developing countries that responds directly to some of opening opposition's material is with respect to China. And that is to say that at the point where US interest rates rise, it is far more likely that developing countries now borrow directly against the yuan instead, meaning China's global hegemony over global finance generally isn't far likely to increase under the point in which these mass infrastructure payments and investments are made by the US uniquely. That was something that was particularly harmful. And note that that was something that was far more important than anything you've heard in the debate to this point, which focuses particularly on the US, which irrespective of directly what the US does, are probably likely to recover from COVID relatively reasonably, insofar as firstly, they already are doing such. But secondly, they have far more luxury and access to things like vaccine in the first place, at the point where we are able to uniquely point out, firstly, that becomes far harder for developing countries to actually do things like borrow and fund their own countries, but also pay back the masses of debt that they already have in a context where they can't pay back debt. But secondly, that these countries are more likely now to turn to China. But of course, that alone is a debate winning benefit. Second extension, why this money is likely to be spent extraordinarily unwisely, four things to say here. Firstly, the government is inefficient in its responses to demands and projects that it invests in won't necessarily fit individuals preferences, which eliminates a lot of the analysis that we hear from opening opposition. Secondly, though, note the scale of bureaucracy that exists in governmental payouts that exist, meaning that there is a long time before this money is injected into the economy actually comes into being and is reflected in the mass wealth people in the economy actually have. And that exacerbates the timing issues that I flagged in my introduction. That is to say, there's a huge injection of capital in the US economy, but that capital takes say two to three years to actually show up on the economy at the point where the government bureaucracy makes it quite slow for this money to pop out, then there is a massive hyperinflation risk that exists in the US that will of course raise the interest rates even further. Thirdly, I think the opening opposition case simply misunderstand what these proposed governmental expenditure policies actually look like. Firstly, there's obviously extraordinarily few incentives to fund minorities in particular, it's far more likely it was middle class people who make up the most of the US economy that they were caring about saving. But secondly, you can't just assert that a lot of this money is going to green industries. Sure, it was true that some of it was, most of it was just going to those industries through which most workers were employed, which in many circumstances were industries that weren't particularly useful with respect to things like the environment. Fourth reason this money is likely to be spent extraordinarily unwisely is I just think opening opposition should check out more fucking economists. They can assert all they want that no economist worldwide has any problem with this spending. But yes, of course, many of them do. Maybe they're only reading US economists who know the impact it might have on that country, but not the impact that it will inevitably have on developing world countries, which is extraordinarily harmful in this debate. Third extension that comes out is the context that the US is present in makes the inflationary risk so particularly harmful. Noting again that our opening government notes that inflation is likely to happen, but don't really point out the particular harms that exist with it. That is the context I've already provided, that this economic downturn and recession is not an outage to others, it was specifically caused by COVID in particular, which meaning that any sort of payments that were made in this way were probably going to be immediately harmful upon a critical mass of people being vaccinated or restrictions easing. That sudden explosion of economic activity that occurred, which as I've already pointed out, might take two to three years to actually be felt in the first place, probably means inflation exists. Why was inflation particularly harmful outside the reasons opening government already provides you? Two reasons. Firstly, it was extremely likely that investor confidence just falls because mass inflation in the US was a departure from the policy setting monetarily that has existed in the last several decades. But secondly, you're likely to get things like panic spending in the US, insofar as the value of individual savings goes down. I'll take a point from opening.

    > POI: So your first extension is contingent on our policy working. Your second extension about how it's inefficient is contingent on our policy not working. Which one is it again?

    Either of them defeat your case, right? So you could believe this money is going to increase the interest rates of the US government, of the US finances, and therefore have a massive harm. Or you could believe that this policy is not going to work internally in the US. But thirdly, I think we can actually straddle the line insofar as we suggest and already provide a framework that shows that developing countries are probably going to spend the longest amount of time actually recovering from the COVID pandemic, say two to three year gaps before they're able to get mass vaccinated. And secondarily, we're also displaying to you that it might take two to three years before the US actually feels its financing from coming through due to the bureaucracy that exists within the US, you know, governmental payments department. And consequently, if those two timings match up, then firstly, you haven't proved a benefit exists in the US. But secondly, a harm to the developing world exists. But thirdly, if the timing was to exist in the US doesn't stop the fact that the developing countries still have an immediate need to borrow and continue to have a need to borrow. But moreover, it doesn't respond to the idea that these countries already have mass debts that are denominated in US currency, which now become far harder to pay off. So obviously, both of those pieces of analysis not only defeat your case, but also egregiously harmful and can have the policies. For those reasons, then, because we're the only team that actually cares that the majority of the world is likely to be put in a harmful position, because we show that the US are unlikely to make particularly successfully, because the inflationary risk is uniquely harmful to things like investor confidence, which again, for developing countries, it's clear causing government to win this debate. Thank you.

    Four things in extension. Firstly, why is this necessary? And otherwise this, these projects simply will not happen unless we do the spending. Secondly, why we economically can do this, we're going to give you three structural reasons why United States, even if it's in a bad situation, can pull this off. Thirdly, why we will pull this off efficiently, scaling up all of the impacts of OO. Fourthly, why these impacts create more revenue down the line, which breaks the deadlock in all of the debate, since we create a better future based on this. I have three responses to the CG extension, which is about the developing world. The first is to say that there are already constraints on the United States lending to these sorts of places. Notice firstly, that structurally these places have the highest amount of risks due to structural problems, like for example, colonialism, they have warfare, you have instability, also currency problems in these sort of things. But also secondly, the people there are not the most educated structurally, you don't have the best workforce, etc. You also have other problems like crime and these type of things. But secondly, politically, this is a very big problem to invest in these sorts of places, because you're basically putting a lot of money with a lot of uncertainty in these sort of things. So neither Republicans nor Democrats do this sort of thing. Thirdly, to say is that you still have other actors in the world who are going to loan these sort of places that are not China, like the European Union, like Brazil, like for example, how do you say the IMF in these sorts of places. Secondly, your response, I think inflation is actually good. And they're basically tricking you in this particular thing. Why can it be good? The basic logic is false, you take up a loan, with this loan, you invest it into physical things that are assets, like for example, building roads, building hospitals, investing companies, etc. When the dollar price goes down, the quantity of the asset actually goes up, because now this asset is worth more dollars in this particular way. But also the cash flow for this, if you want to sell the asset, but also the cash flow based upon this also increases because its price also goes up. So you actually have bigger capacity to pay off the loans on their side of the house, they're basically tricking you. But thirdly, China is likely to invest in these places symmetrically, because the West has a lot of human rights restrictions that basically make these sorts of authoritarian regimes or corrupt democracies go to China symmetrically because they won't want to deal with this sort of shit. And China is giving out a really, really good bargain, because they can sacrifice short-term accounts for better these sorts of things. This extension goes down. Let's go to another extension. Why is this necessary? I want to note, opening the opposition, the only line when you say this is that these sorts of places are, it's hard for you to get capital for the companies to follow this sort of fashion. The structural reason for this is these projects that we're talking about, things like building bridges, things like building buildings and these types of things require a huge amount of initial investment in order to do these sort of things. Why is this the case? Firstly, because the risk of you building these sorts of places is very problematic. Secondly, the materials cost a lot of money, etc. But the problem is that when companies get together, they basically have to trust each other to pull money from themselves and do this sort of thing. Why do they don't want to do this? Firstly, they have fees costs and burial costs that they have to spend in these particular things, etc. Secondly, you don't know if one of your partners is going to go out of the equation at this point. But thirdly, you don't know if it's going to be profitable, or you're going to do this sort of thing because it's very long term. We solve this when investing huge amounts of money in this particular thing, because we're taking away this uncertainty. But secondly, we want to talk about uncertainty is that you do not necessarily know if this is going to be profitable in the long term. This isn't to say that it isn't profitable, but that there is sufficient uncertainty for you to invest in other type of projects that are smaller. But when you have big amounts of cash, you're able to take up this uncertainty to do this sort of thing. Thirdly, when government backing exists, it creates competition between companies to basically do the competition thing where they want to go in and get on these sort of things. But fourthly, structuring the places that we're going to invest, like Detroit, like the Rust Belt, these are places where there is a lack of investment anyway. So you need government spending in these sorts of places in order to get this particular thing. This proves to you why this policy is necessary. OG's only response to this is to say, ah, but it isn't politically palatable to give to these sorts of projects. Three responses. Firstly, it's bipartisan. Many people want this sort of thing because it caters to the interests of people. Secondly, this is an immense voter issue, right? Like if you have a fucking destroyed bridge or you have unemployment based upon this protein, people care about this sort of thing. So you're likely to capitalize. But thirdly, sometimes it's necessary for these sort of things for just your life going, etc. This proves why it is necessary. Secondly, why will we economically be able to do this first line of analysis? We can simply increase taxes, right? We can increase tax revenue. First reason. Notice that Trump actually cut taxes down and the economy went up based upon this particular thing. So you actually have four years of Trumpist tax cuts that actually create more revenue in the economy. Now, in this cycle, Biden can increase the taxes, which, by the way, he already did to do this sort of things. Secondly, notice that Biden is currently basically pushing out world minimum tax on these sort of things. Why is he efficacious to do this? Firstly, there is immense buying from the G7 and G20 to basically take away half tax savings in this particular thing, and they're likely to push this legislation. The importance of this sort of thing is if you take away tax havens and basically put it on a minimum, companies that are now located in these sort of places like Arden will relocate back to United States because they have much, much more certainty in these four places, they can influence more, etc. The only reason they go there is because of the minimum tax. That means that you're able to get more tax revenue in this particular thing. But thirdly, you have all the other companies that are resorting. Second reason, and I've always waited to say this, money printer go bird. Like notice that a dollar is, how do you say, the strongest currency in the world. The reason for this is there's massive certainty that the dollar is not going to die because everyone is using this. Notice analysis. The strength of the currency is based upon the belief that this currency is efficacious. The more we use it, we only ascribe it value because we're using it. This currency is associated with loans, with currency research. So it's not going to go down and we can push out. Notice United States printed out $10 trillion and it didn't have that big of an impact on the economy. The dollar is just like a little, little small thing. And this is factologically true. But thirdly, you can still get money from other loans, right? Like China can give you money, EU can give you money. And notice that you've always paid back your loans. Like you have been continuously doing this. So you're likely to receive loans because you're the best customer in this particular thing. This is why we can get the money. Open government.

    > POI: Infrastructure contractors competing for government contracts over promised deadlines and spending, which can be the tipping point for many projects not being worthwhile due to their actual income tax dollars and construction.

    This is not the case, firstly, because there are many companies that are competing with us. Secondly, as per your own analysis, they need the cash now. So they're likely to be very, very good in efficacious towards this sort of thing. So your own analysis flips your POI. Let's prove why this is efficacious. Firstly, notice that governments have expertise, right? Like you can get private sector people to work in your government. So you're likely to do calculations adequately. Secondly, this is the first time that it is done. So you have first time or advantage to capitalize on this particular thing. So you want to be efficacious. Governments has massive checks and balance mechanisms to search for things like corruption, to search for things like inefficiency to do this sort of things. Thirdly, likely the place you're going to target this is strategically selective is where you're actually going to be able to get your revenue back. Fourthly, like we have done this in the past, like remember the Hoover Dam and these sort of things. This is why you're likely to incentivize to have the ability to make this efficacious. Why are these benefits the most important things? Firstly, notice with unemployment, basically, the problem is that you have an entire generation of people, they cannot get to a point because they don't have necessarily the skills and these sort of things. When they work on this project, they're able to capitalize on these skills, they're able to sell this off on their CV, and they're likely to be more employed. But secondly, other businesses will drop off based upon these particular things, meaning that the asset price will go down and the cash will be increased on this particular thing, which means that this is an investment that will create more dividends down the line when it increases because people get more job opportunities and businesses prop up. See how it takes this debate.

    Two questions in this speech. Firstly, why will inflation occur? And why is that the most important harm in this debate? And then secondly, do government investments actually create benefits like the odd bench consists? Okay, firstly, on inflation, note, I think that OG spends a weird amount of their case talking about the disadvantages of spending and debt. But I think that this is probably deprioritized in this debate for the reason that US bonds are extraordinarily reliable, such that debt increases in debt can often be absorbed. That's not to say that they're harmful to the economy, financial risk do not exist, but just that this is an ideal but probably not the end of the world. What is the end of the world? What does have the most international implications? We thought it was likely inflation, we tell you two things I think really clearly at closing government. The first thing is we're the only team to actually mechanize why inflation occurs, which is as follows. Firstly, note that this policy occurs in the context of an existing recovery. It is one which like has already had some degree of stimulus. It is one which is already seen the US bounce back to an extent with positive growth rates. It is one that you know, obviously, once people get sufficient vaccinations, they clearly have incentives to like reopen their businesses. There is also actually just likely to be quite a lot of happiness about the economy reopening and people's willingness to engage in it. We think that you will likely able to do things like encourage people, you know, to go like do stimulus without necessarily even giving them money. But what happened now that you had a truly enormous stimulus, it is important to note that this is a substantial large scale stimulus, not just any stimulus, what happened now is that the immediate capacity constraints that all teams agree exists mean that the US economy is unprepared for this enormous growth of the money supply, and therefore you get inflation. Now what were the immediate effects of inflation, which are uniquely well impacted at CG? A few things. Firstly, we told you that inflation totally destroys inflation. The second thing to say is that this creates a cycle of inflation, because now what occurs is people know that the money in their bank account is decreasing in its value, and so they do things like panic spending. In the long run, that means you have less investment funds because people have spent it on short term items, that leads to a cycle of inflation. So, you know, the US economy is not prepared for this. So, there is a cycle of inflation, and the reason why it is so important is because it is a cycle of inflation. So, you know, the fourth thing to say, though, and I think that this is most important, is that interest rates rise, and there are two reasons why interest rates rise. The first thing to say is the central bank is forced to respond to the cost of living, which is rising and is likely a kind of substantial issue. The second thing to say is just that there is kind of substantial economic and political pressure on the central bank to respond to the cost of living, and the third thing to say is that the cost of living increases. So, you know, the central bank is forced to respond to the cost of living, and the third thing to say is just that there is kind of substantial economic and political pressure to protect people's savings. Like, obviously, you know, the middle class is significantly distressed when their savings decrease in value. Obviously, this is something which is a large scale political concern, and I think that that means it is highly likely that interest rates are eventually forced to rise. And that has a few problems. Obviously, in a context where these opposition teams have spent an enormous amount of their cases talking about the risks of consumer debt in the US, at the point where the US is facing the worst harms in this debate, but importantly, at CIG, we tell you that you should not just care about the United States, which is to say that an increase in interest rates on the US dollar had dire international consequences. As Sweeney tells you, to minimal response, this increases the cost of borrowing internationally. And this was super important, because it was most likely that other countries had sort of worse experiences with COVID, and they uniquely needed to borrow in a way which was far more pressing for the US's need to borrow or the US's debt or whatever. CIG's responses to this material are as follows. Firstly, there's like, that they're like, there are existing lending constraints towards developing countries. Firstly, this is at best mitigatory, we would still oppose making them far worse. But I think the second thing to say is just this is not how lending works. Like when you know, most debts in the international economy are done in USD, that does not mean they're borrowing directly from the US government, it might be the fact that they're trading with other countries in US dollars, it might be the fact they're engaging, you know, with US firms. So even if it is the case that the US government doesn't lend a heap to these firms, that just does not understand how the international economy works. But regardless, we would say you should not make those constraints worse. The other thing they tell us is that actually inflation is likely good, you know, because it might lead to growth and things like that. I think the first thing to say is this was totally unresponsive to the harms we tell you of increased interest rates, which lead to things like debt crises, which lead to hyperinflation. But the second thing to say is obviously, you know, even if it is the case that some small degree of inflation might work in the US, firstly, we think that this enormous level of stimulus probably pushes the US past that kind of moderate low level of inflation that people would be comfortable with, investors would be rational with. But secondly, this, you know, that only explains why it would be okay for the US, it does not respond to the international harms. So I think, at the end of this is very clear that inflation is the worst harm in this debate, it has the largest scale international consequences, or be prevented, I think, as the primary issue in this debate, I'll take a point from closing.

    > POI: Look, this is contingent on inflation happening on the first place, we give you four structural reasons why inflation will not happen or what happened to that scale. But what are your structural reasons for inflation happening?

    Okay, yeah. So there's a few things to say here. Firstly, if you get no inflation, then you probably aren't substantially increasing economic growth. So I'm not sure why you would support that. But I think the second thing to say is, we tell you very clearly at Sweeney why inflation occurs, which is to say that it is very likely, you know, that there is a sudden spike in the economy at the point where things open back up after a critical mass. And if you have pumped the economy full of money, without, you know, substantially increasing productivity or capacity constraints, that leads to a sudden spike in inflation, you can actually respond to those structural reasons. You know, I think it will probably be too late. All right, do the government investments actually create benefits? Because this is where opposition mainly claims are, you know, their case, I think there are three major benefits. The first one is that this is kind of the only way to boost your spending or to recover from COVID. Note that this largely relies on factual assertions about whether this is a good idea, according to economists, or about the priorities of the spending, we can also make factual assertions, the official projections of the US government suggested that with literally no stimulus whatsoever, there would only be a lag of about 1.3% behind the potential GDP of the US, which is just not true that that leads to mass economic collapse. But additionally, we thought that low interest rates were likely to be effective for three reasons. Firstly, because there would be more company investment, rather than just short term spending, because you're encouraged to, you know, finance projects in the long run. Secondly, because consumer confidence would be higher because it's not just viewed as like a stopgap desperate measure from the government. And thirdly, because we thought the market was often more efficient at allocating those funds than the government itself. Their claim is that interest rates are already low, but firstly, quantitative easing exists. But secondly, obviously, you can encourage investment through political means as well. The other things they tell us is that there will be support for minority voters. But I think that this is silly, because obviously, there are not substantial electoral incentives to prioritise minority voters. And even if there were, we would say the Republicans would probably not be a huge fan of that. But also their examples don't even make sense. Like, why is highways good for minorities, like they're often bulldozed in the minority community. It's a bit weird. The final thing we hear is that environmental benefits and spending on good infrastructure. Firstly, I would note that I think the examples provided by the op bench kind of contradict each other. Either we're doing political expedient investment in fucking Detroit, or actually helping the environment, these things don't super coexist. But finally, I would say that the US government does this uniquely inefficiently, as is explained down the government bench to minimal response. We prefer like the market and the investment market to do that, which they are already doing. At the end of this debate, investment, I think is the clear reason why inflation is the reason why CG.

    All of the impacts of closing government are reliant on one asserted claim, which is inflation is going to happen. And then everything is going to shit the fan. Then we asked, what are your structural reasons as to why inflation is going to happen? And the answer, because of immediate spending. But this is not how infrastructure projects like this work. The way that CG imagined is working is basically by the science paper. And tomorrow, he transfers 10 million to companies all over the US, and everybody starts working. This is not how it works. This plan is contractors over the span of eight years, and is backed up by other projections as to, for example, the taxes that you're going to accumulate by reforming your current tax policy, which is one of the three structural reasons the Truman gives you as to why inflation is not going to happen. As long as they don't have even this immediate impact, I am unsure as to what I say, because the next thing they say is, because we basically pump a lot of money, we don't actually pump them into efficient stuff. And then if I just managed to prove to you that this is going to be happening in an efficient way, we also win over that particular clash. But notice second, member of closing government says, oh, actually, US economy is recovering, things are bad, things are happening, so you don't have the money. And then CG whip stands up and says, Oh, no, actually, US economy is bouncing back, things are going to going to become better, everything is okay. If that is true, then why wouldn't we invest in projects who wouldn't otherwise be invested in, in order to create jobs and all the benefits that Truman talked about, and notice no direct responses as to the particular positive benefits that we create of those particular infrastructure projects, and how they trickle down to businesses and working class members, because this is not like about, this is going to be medium class, like medium class people don't be don't build bridges, I think that this is fair to say. And the second thing is that all of the things that they say, oh, after inflation happens, there's going to be panic spending, and things like that, all of this, again, reliant on this idea that there is going to be inflation, which we kind of disprove. So apart from the three reasons that Truman gives to you, I'm going to give you two more just so you have like five versus one, and it's an easy call for you. Okay, look, the fourth reason for us apart from taxes, ability to take loans, and actually money printer Goldberg, right? Actually, the stock market of the United States right now is tremendously going good. There is a structural reasons for that not only that is a factual thinking the world that but the structural reason is that companies in the US actually, basically took advantage of the COVID situation fairly quickly. Big tech companies such as Google, Apple, and whatever were able to implement their strategies fairly quickly and to actually adapt to the current scenarios. Second of all, people wanted, wanted to invest in other stuff. There's also like, a lot of things happen in the store, stock market in terms of like, people just generally be more interested into it. So the trust over the stock market increased, and all of those things. There's also things such as consulting firms started consulting everybody on how to deal with COVID, which increased another part of the US economy of this is another reason as to why us is actually doing fairly good in terms of in terms of money. And I think that this overall trust is basically another very big reason as to why us dollar is going to continue doing a lot of good does removing any part of the inflation mechanisms or whatever. And for a fifth reason is basically that already a lot of countries have actually took upon loans against the US dollar because exactly of the COVID situation, which increased their interest to continue trusting the same US dollar, but also like generally, comparatively, if you have to compare countries that have taken nuanced loans versus country that have taken us loans already, retrospectively, there's 10, 10 times more of the first one, I think that we win over this particular clash. Before I continue, I'm going to take opening.

    > POI: Economic growth relies on people spending their income, your justification for spending is that you can raise taxes doesn't see a tax rise disincentivize consumers from spending invalidating your OSMAC.

    No, because it's important to understand who are going to actually, we are going to tax, we don't say we're going to tax everybody. We're saying we're going to tax multinational companies who are doing very well on the stock market. I pretty much explained that. Now, moving on to opening responses, because I think that this is fairly important. But before that, on the efficacy point, I almost forgot that because this is like, oh, bullshit, they basically give you two reasons, right? First is like, two, three is capital is going to come in slow, I already kind of rebutted this by saying that we're not going to spend all of the money on the project in one particular time, or even two, three years, but rather five, five or eight years, or even more. But more important, there's a political incentive for Biden administration to pull this off, because there are a lot of Republicans who are waiting on them to fail in order to actually, in order to actually call them out in terms of their inefficacy, and how bureaucratic they are and things like that. So you have a massive political incentive to increase oversight on our side of the house. Second of all, cooperation with the private sector and using their abilities, and even using the currently created blue dot network, and its expertise and know how and certifying projects is another good way to push your political agenda and also make things actually, actually better. So I think that on that particular stuff, but also in terms of the like, for example, if you're going into Detroit, Detroit workers are actually much cheaper than for example, California workers. So you're able to have a pretty good ratio between efficiency and actually how much you invest in the project in the first place. So I think we went on over the efficiency class as well. So in terms of opening government, I think that like, again, they still have the same argument about economy is going to go bad, we give you five reasons as to why economy is going to stay good. So in that particular comparative, so we actually win over and in terms of short term mystic thinking of the projects, I don't think that like you get you actually have an incentive to sell long term projects, such as eight years, because then there is an incentives for other companies and other politicians for you to say, Oh, my gosh, I have to be reelected in order to finish that plan. And companies who take advantage of that plan are going to lobby for you. But also, if actually Republican comes comes down to place, he still has the incentive to continue policies if they're good, and they're helping, such as like Biden, who continued a lot of Trump policies in terms of like stimulus packages and things like that. So short term mystic thinking didn't exist. Overall, they never really kind of compared with our benefits in terms of businesses. So we also win over that clash. Very happy to oppose this one.

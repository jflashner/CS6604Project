    Publicly traded companies represent a world-changing force that will sweep across the developing world, displacing local industries and replacing jobs with automation. We think that it is only responsible and right that the governments of these developing countries demand some control over their fate and have the ability to exercise some control over exploitative corporate structures. What is our stance? Firstly, we think that developing countries acquire, on the open market, large shares in major publicly traded corporations like Google, GSK, and so on. Secondly, this can be done by sovereign wealth funds or other government investment organizations like trusts. The aim will be to have a reasonable number of voting shares in these large companies. We understand that not every single developing country will be able to acquire a majority stake, but we think that if a sufficiently large number of developing countries do so, they will often have common interests that will allow them to vote in favor of the developing world as a whole, and we think that this will be beneficial. Also, note that there are many developing countries with large sovereign wealth funds and with large financial ability to engage in these open market transactions. Note, for example, Brazil and India are great examples in this case. So, we think that in many cases, this is likely to be effective. We're going to put two arguments: firstly, about safeguarding financial and national security; secondly, about protecting the interests of developing countries from corporate and post-war exploitation. Firstly, on safeguarding financial security, note that it is highly likely that these stocks and securities are going to be stable and therefore represent a viable investment choice for these nations, particularly if they invest in a diverse portfolio. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, note that many of these are very large established companies with high market capitalizations and high trading volumes. These firms are likely to reveal reliable dividends for the next 10 to 20 years, especially since many of them work in both areas and in industries which are not likely to fail, like for example, Alphabet or Pfizer, which works in industries like technology and healthcare, which really will remain stable for at least the next 20 years. We also know that many of these investments have higher returns than foreign government bonds or other assets and commodities. Note that, for example, bond yields right now are basically zero, so they don't represent a comparable beneficial source of investment for many of these government sovereign wealth funds. Also, note that in terms of investment, the commodities most developing countries are already overexposed to risk from commodities trading. The reason for this is because often they rely heavily on agricultural exports, they rely on natural resources which are based on the basis of the economy. Often the economy is quite labor-intensive and as a consequence of this, they are already overexposed to many of these other commodities. As a consequence of that, we think that it's beneficial to invest in these companies. Also, note that many of the companies stated that we will trade that these companies that these developing countries will invest in are banks, which are often sponsored by First World Government because they are too big to fail. So, we think that many reasons why these represent stable investments that will continue to yield dividends in the long term and they represent a good investment for many of these developing countries. Critically, this is a comparative here. Where will this money be used otherwise by the governments of these developing countries? We put to you that we've already explained why most other asset classes are not stable investments for the governments of many of these developing countries, but we think that often what happens on the comparative is that investment in local companies or the buying off of political patrons is more likely to happen. Why is this harmful and why is this likely to happen? First of all, this is obviously harmful because it leads to a development trap where governments know or don't know which industries to bet on and they're able to justify this using some ambiguity, choosing inefficient industries or resorting to crony capitalism. While it is not clear that governments have, you know, like perfect 20/20 vision when it comes to betting on like global industries as a whole, we think that often the choices facing international markets are more stable and more predictable as opposed to choices within their own country where often they just default to crony capitalism and choosing the highest based on their political patrons. Also, note that, for example, this happens in many, many different countries, even those with relatively high levels of development. Note how Malaysia bet wrongly on its national airline and automaker, or Indonesia bet wrongly on many local industries, being that political leaders and investors have friends in these local industry groups. And also note that local industry has weaker oversight regimens. As a consequence of this, we think the comparative is often that you bet on inefficient local industries that are likely to fail and won't likely support your development in the long term. Also, note that it's easier to justify spending money on what is seen as a beneficial foreign investment, since most people in the country can agree that, for example, Alphabet is not likely to fail, so it's possible to siphon money off from funding local industries into funding that instead. This is something that's politically feasible that represents a path forward that is easy to justify to ordinary people in your country as compared to other types of investment, because we think that often when you're dealing with things like taxpayers' money, often justifying it to the public is very important. So, the ultimate end result of this is that we lock money into a security that pays dividends and cannot be sold in the short term. This is actually particularly important because note that in many of these countries, changes of government are highly likely to happen, and often the political climate is quite mercurial, which means that if we lock something into a stable investment that will yield reliable dividends, this money can't be siphoned off. This is a publicly traded company in a moment, so we are able to see how much money the government is investing in this company and hold the government to account for it, as opposed to an okay global process. I'll take closing.

    Well, because we think that even if the US economy goes into recession, this will impact the economies of other developing countries and their local businesses as well, there's no comparatively better investment. Moreover, we don't think that the US economy going into recession will cause all US MNCs to have stock prices tank. We think that in the long term, this is still more stable than investing in local industries. Okay, so as a consequence, this money can't be siphoned away and therefore we prevent future governments from reneging on our economic policy. Secondly, about corporate exploitation, there are a number of mechanisms here. Note that MNCs have been instrumental in entrenching various types of abuse and exploitation in the developing world. For example, Shell forcing miners to use cocaine in Nigeria, Pfizer using monopoly prices on drugs that price poor people off the market and made them unable to afford these goods, and MNCs setting up highly polluted industries in the third world and dumping waste into rivers that flow downstream into developing countries. This is incredibly harmful. Why do we change this in the comparative? Firstly, because we have shareholder rights, so we have voting ability over these companies. Note that even if one individual country doesn't have power, we think that various large developing countries like Brazil have fairly large purchasing power in terms of shares, and moreover, these shares have certain common interests, like not dumping pollution down river. As a consequence of that, we think that we have the ability to change the behavior of these companies and increase the corporate social responsibility. Also, note that we can threaten to sell the stock and short the stock. As a consequence of this, we have more leverage over the bots of these first world corporations. But note that we also have control over first world countries right now, and perhaps this responds in part to that point of information. Note that these large companies spend a very large amount of money on lobbying the governments of the first world and funding political campaigns. On the comparative, therefore, having them beholden to us, or at least having some rights to, for example, drastically reduce the value of their stock by selling in the short term, actually threatens, or at least gives us some degree of parity in terms of bargaining power with the governments of many of these first world countries, which often are lobbied by many of these companies and also in themselves hold stock in many of these companies. So, moreover, we know that many of these companies are seen as a matter of national prestige for countries like the USA, and as a consequence of that, the success or failure is actually highly contingent on how these companies perform. We at least restore a degree of parity in a manner otherwise would not be possible between the developed and developing world. We're proud to propose.

    There are two massive contradictions in the PM's case. Contradiction the first. On the one hand they say they're buying enormous shares in companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars which is why they're capable of influencing corporate behavior. On the second hand they're also going to be totally diversified. The way to get diversification is to buy large numbers of unguarded companies not one not two not even five or ten. They cannot possibly get large voting shares in a hundred billion dollar companies and be diversified. They have to pick undiversification. Secondly they make a second contradiction when they say governments make terrible decisions in picking companies in order to address them but also they're gonna be picking amazing foreign companies. To be clear projecting foreign corporate growth is also as difficult as projecting domestic corporate growth. It might even be more difficult because you don't have core competencies in projecting what are the kind of growth opportunities in that company. Goldman Sachs and other institutional investors get that kind of investment wrong all the time. They cannot possibly say they're terrible at picking domestic choices and that they're going to be living on investment gods at picking foreign ones. Their case is riddled with contradictions. They're out of the ramp. Why do we think this is the absolute money loser and terribly for undermining development? Three mechanisms for this. Firstly it's going to be enormously expensive to buy these shares. The value of a stock is the discounted present value of future dividends. That is if they are going to issue dividends back to shareholders that say $100 it is reduced over time say $100 worth today is worth more is worth more than say $100 tomorrow so they discount that over the future. Here's the thing. Massive blue chip companies are least likely to be companies that are underpriced because they have enormous amounts of attention based on them and like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bridgewater, an opening government well-known, spends enormous amount of attention looking at these kinds of things. Which means it is very unlikely that they're going to be finding this massive inefficiency of the market that all of Wall Street and the Wall Streets of other countries haven't noticed. This means in order to get any of these benefits they're literally paying $100 back in discounted present value. It's going to cost them $20 billion to maybe be able to influence Google, which should be clear, not super sure how Google is oppressing like Nigeria or Malaysia or any of these other countries. But secondly, they're very likely to undermine the governance of these countries for three reasons. One, there's political incentives to extract wealth in the countries. For example, they might demand dividends back to shareholders in times of economic growth that require fire selling assets because they desperately need money before an election campaign to spend on things. To be clear, they even concede this when they say we're going to be massively changing corporate practices to affect things. Other shareholders are aware that they're only buying this company to change their corporate practices. So what do they do? They fire sell the stock. Oh, it suddenly seems that Malaysia wants to buy this company in order to stop them from engaging in certain practices? Yeah, sell, sell, sell. So as soon as they buy at $100 a stock, the stock value falls to $50. What do you do? You just lit your money on fire and lost it all overnight. But the fact is, they concede that on the Prime Minister when they say they're a massively changing corporate practice. They cannot have their cake and eat it too. In order to get $100 worth of value, they're going to have to spend $200. But thirdly, these companies have certainly become too big to fail and demand to fail. This is when they say you have influence over these companies. They have influence over you because you just spent $20 billion of developing control of your money that you don't have large amounts of to get it. Here's the thing, the bank owes you $1,000, the bank owes you. The bank owes you $10 billion. You own the bank, they cannot afford you to fail, which means you are very likely if there's ever a downfall or anything else in the company, you are going to be spending in a shit ton of money in order to bail it out. Why is this a problem? One, you're going to piss off the population. Even honestly, if it wasn't that expensive, you're going to piss them off. They say it's really easy to justify. Everyone knows Google. That's going to make it even harder because one, it's seen as foreign. It is seen as a giveaway to something everyone knows is extraordinarily wealthy. If someone says, I'm gonna spend my government money $20 billion to buy a stake of Google, I'm gonna see what a vanity project for my politician is. Fuck those guys, I'm going to vote them out of office. Secondly, this is losing enormous amount of money for other internal improvements. We want to characterize a lot of these nations as some of them are cash strapped generally and need money for debt servicing, infrastructure, etc. But even those that have generally fine on cash are cash strapped during kinds of crises. But now their money is locked up in Google, it's locked up in Pfizer, and they cannot access it to engage in the kind of stimulus measures necessary to get a financial crisis. This is a god awful idea. Next, why is this extraordinarily risky? This is directly responsible here from the Prime Minister. One, blue chip companies are highly correlated with the market, particularly the kind of market set of contagion effect. That is, they're correlated with the domestic market. So yeah, not every MNC is going to go into deep red during recessions, but most of them probably are. That is what a recession is, and you're very unlikely to be magically picking the one that isn't. In particular, if you want to invest, invest in assets uncorrelated with the market. In particular, as CG correctly pointed out, the US might turn into recession. The EU hasn't topped 1% growth in god knows how long. This is very likely to be correlated with the market. Why does this matter? Because it means when you need the money the most, and you need the cash during, say, a recession, this is when you're least likely to have the cash and dividends, because those companies are struggling. But secondly, as I alluded before, they're totally undiversified. They cannot buy hundreds of different companies and have major owner stakes over them. They get one and not the other. What you did, you put all your eggs in one basket. This means that during a downturn, you have no money. This is when you need the money the most. What is the third argument? There are so many alternatives if you want to do so, we're going to weaponize the same political capital. If you want investment and get countries to invest in you, you have clear courts, you can have property rights, you can have relatively consistent regulatory enforcement, and non-competition taxation. This is the development track that Malaysia has used successfully, South Korea has used successfully, etc. Secondly, we would prefer to spend the money on infrastructure. They have to spend $100 to get $100 in value. We can spend $100 to get $400 in value by connecting a road to a village, and now that village can sell goods on the market and lift themselves out of poverty way more efficiently. Thirdly, if you have to invest in a sovereign wealth fund, and some countries like Malaysia have made a legitimate choice to do so, invest in things that are uncorrelated with the market and highly diversified. This is why sovereign wealth funds like those, say Norway, invest in things like timber, or I don't know, really low-fee index funds, which have incredibly great growth rates and are so diversified that they're very high returns. They say, oh, you're likely to spend this money poorly. We've got to weaponize the same political capital that they do. Presumably, sovereign wealth funds are capable of investing in the next five to 30 enormously large numbers of them to do so. There's not enough for them to say, well, we can invest in these things and get some money. They have to prove why it's actually a meaningfully good alternative. Finally, we think they're going to undermine development of domestic firms. Recognize, based on the argument that this corporation is influenced over view, other companies who are potentially going to compete with, say Pfizer, recognize that the company is likely to give privileges to the company that they own 20% share of. What does that mean? It's impossible to own your own domestic company or start that up. Why is that good? Because they actually give all of their profits back to people, they're willing to be employing local people, and they develop core best practices and expertise. Because you're out of time, this means that you're very unlikely to get meaningful domestic funds. Finally, some reputation. They say you're going to prevent exploitation of the rich countries. One, this is likely to piss off the rich countries even more, who now feel that they're being threatened. This is why we have laws like CIF and the United States and EU which restrict the voting ability on corporate boards of foreigners, specifically in firms that are broadly and very generously defined to be related to national security. These are all reasons to suggest, if anything, the influence over rich companies is going to make them jealously protective of those companies that feel unlikely to give you anything of meaning. There are so many great things that sovereign wealth funds have done successfully in places like, say, Malaysia. This is not one of them. Strongly opposed.

    The problem with side-opening opposition's arguments about, well, we could just use the political capital to invest in other things, is that there really isn't political capital in developing countries to do this right now. The reason there is no political capital to do this is because it is such a thing that would take the money away from the reach of corruption, away from the reach of people who would invest it badly in cronyist, and give it to companies that are stable and effective and non-corrupt investments. We are very happy that this motion says that it believes that it would be good if developing countries did this, because it would be great for them. But the comparative realistically, as Arthur gives you many arguments in favor of, is that this money is likely to be stolen, this money is likely to be invested into cronyist companies in the internal stock market, this money is likely to be used extremely ineffectively. First, I'm going to do some rebuttal, then I'm going to talk about political capital regulation and why that's much more important. Then finally, I'm going to talk about its quality as an investment and why that's less important, but still why it's a better investment. On rebuttal, they say that there's a question of how much you buy and it would be too expensive to buy a large amount. Notice that I gave in our model saying that these developing countries should each buy a small percentage of each company and developing countries could work together in order to exert their influence. They have a shared interest in doing this because they all have the interest of stopping these companies from destroying the developing world and therefore they can all vote together as shareholders as a block. Secondly, notice that you do not need to own a large percentage of the company in order to be an impactful shareholder. You need to be able to do things in investor meetings and bring up your issues as a shareholder, but also even if you sold a small percentage of the company, selling it very quickly means that you can exert a lot of power over the company. It's not like you need to own 10 or 20% of the company. You can own 1% or a fraction of that and still have a lot of power there. Finally, they don't respond to Arthur's arguments about corruption and why this money is likely to be invested badly. Notice that if you're investing in tech, for instance, that's a very different correlation with your local industry, which means that's not a really good thing. Then on the other, rebuttal, which is like they claim that they're better investing in local companies. Maybe they know more about local companies, but they can't invest well in them because they're very corrupt locally. For instance, the structural mechanisms for this are like when you're in local government and you're deciding whether to invest in it, you probably went to school with and or know the people who are running the major companies of your local stock market. So you're probably going to invest in these terrible companies because you know them and therefore want to help your friends do well. Or you're probably also, in these cases, many of these local companies are very, very connected with the government in these countries, which means that they're likely to invest them extremely badly in these local areas. Then also notice that the government performance is already highly correlated with the local companies. We think it's way better for them to invest in international companies. The other things that they talk about, like international timber, have the same problems in terms of lack of expertise that they try and talk about. But also notice that it's much harder to invest in international timber or that kind of thing than just invest in large companies. Also, there's no political capital to do this in the Senate's Court. That's why it's great under our side of the House. On regulation under our side, under the Senate's Court, we have no ability to regulate these companies for a number of structural reasons. Firstly, Western governments have the incentives and the control over these developing countries. They can exert this control through things like the IMF, through things like the existence of loans, but also just through their militaries and their active ability to exclude these companies from international markets in terms of trade, all of that kind of thing. Secondly, these large international companies are really powerful. They have hundreds of billions of dollars, therefore it's hard to influence them. Thirdly, they are distanced from local companies and therefore they can control these local companies. Notice that it doesn't matter so much to these local companies' profit margins to stop exploiting within these countries, given that about $1 of your iPhone's cost comes from the very low wages that it charges, and Apple takes 50% of the cost in profit. It doesn't really matter that much to their profit margins if you can take away this tiny cost. So it's still a way better investment than we're investing in other industries, while you can actually exert this influence to a great gain for these countries. Why do these countries have the incentive to use them? Because people in these countries can directly blame the government now. But also people in these countries are really, really angry at the point when these companies are massively jacking up drug prices and stop maintaining that everyone in these countries cannot actually pay for the drugs that they want. I think the government does want to end the exploitation of their financial institutions by banks like JPMorgan. They do want to end the fact that millions of people in their country cannot afford medicine because Pfizer is deciding to do monopoly pricing. They also do want to end the fact that Shell is exploiting their natural resources terribly, and the U.S. government is stopping them from doing that much about it. The only way to end this kind of thing is going actively to the companies to stop that. Analysis from after that was unresponded to, except to say that Google is not so important. Google is not really doing all that exploitation. Well, the massive companies are exploiting them to a very, very large extent. If you want to quibble with one example, that's fine. I think there's a shared interest between developing countries to stop this, because otherwise developing countries feel like they will be picked off one at a time. Why is this so impactful and so important? I think it is more important than how much money the sovereign wealth fund makes, whether the people in your country have medicine and whether you can stop that from actually being the case. Or whether the people in your country are not exploited by large international banks. Or whether the people in your country have no exploitative labor conditions because these large industries are deciding to try and squeeze out the maximum amount of profit by just making the conditions in factories absolutely terrible. I think that's way more important than 1% of returns for your stock market. Then they say that other investors will fire-sell this, so it will be a bad thing. This means that these countries can even just threaten to own states in this in order to control the companies, and therefore it will be terrible for companies, which means that these companies have the incentive not to do terrible things for these countries at the point when their people invest. Their fire-selling mechanism is a mechanism for our side because it strengthens the ability that we have to control these countries. Then they say that there will be popular anger within these countries. This is patently false given that these people in these countries love to end high drug prices as well. They also want to destroy the destruction of their local environment, etc. Then finally they say, oh, piss off rich countries. I think the rich countries also like their local stock markets getting invested in, but also they're just like, if we have power within their markets, then we can actually control these countries to the extent of selling them. It doesn't matter whether we piss them off a little bit given that they already want to destroy these countries. Yes, I'll take closing.

    Because I already preempted that by making the argument that the amount of profit that these companies make is already egregious, so it's a tiny proportion of the profit, the changes that they otherwise would have, but also because they know that they would not have enough votes, or they would not have enough help without help from all the other developing countries all over that would otherwise be helping sell in this mechanism. I think also at the very worst, if we stop India from having exploitative drug prices, that's great on the outside of the house. On its quality as an investment, Arthur says it gives you many reasons that they don't respond to in terms of diversification, protection from crony capitalism, protection from direct ceiling. Also notice that the sovereign wealth of many countries is not great. It's great for them to invest in a very stable thing, but also notice that there's an additional mechanism which is that these countries need dollar cash flows because they borrow in dollars. So for instance, they need dividends to be paid in dollars because they can't borrow in their local currency, which is not traded that much, unless they pay very egregious risk premiums for borrowing in that local currency, which means that they need dollars to service that debt, and especially when in times of crisis, it's really, really important for them to have flows in dollars, otherwise they cannot pay that with local tax revenues. This mitigates the worst crises of these countries, I'm proud to propose.

    There are two burdens that opening government had to meet to win front half, they did neither. First, they had to prove that this investment will instantly send your economy careening into the toilet, and second of all, they had to prove that even if there are some benefits, if they're not outweighed by the alternative things you could do with your money, I think Will has proven why they feel to meet both of those burdens. So first, the part of what we give you that's severely under-covered, whether this will just send your economy into the toilet. Will tells you three things. First of all, they say that it's really stable and these companies are doing really well, but I think they never engage with the structural analysis Will gives me, which is first, these things are really expensive without a lot of expected payoff out of it. The present value, future value thing is just a fact to finance. That is, these companies probably aren't particularly under-valued compared to other things you could invest in. You're probably not getting a lot of money out. They tell you that, ah, but it's really important for them to get their dividends in dollars. Countries get their dividends in dollars all the time by investing in U.S. treasuries, unclear why they have to invest in companies instead. But I think what they don't really engage with is the thing about undermining governance. Our mechanism here was really simple. If you believe the bulk of their argumentation, that you are buying this in order to be effective at changing corporate practices, to the extent that that is true, other investors will notice this and flee instantly, because you are changing their corporate practices in a way that reduces your own profits, but also everyone else's profits as well. So to the extent that they are successful in gaining benefits and stopping exploitation, they're also losing all of their money and sending their economy into the toilet and making it so when there is a recession, they have no dividends to rely on because of this. Their only response is that, ah, but now you'll just threaten to buy up the additional shares. So first of all, investors just probably won't sell to you if you're just going to tank the stock even worse. I think it's pretty reasonable that the company can just tell investors not to sell to you. But also, I just want to point out, they say, ah, but by threatening to sell and buy, you have a lot of power over the company. Note that, as Will tells you, the company also has a lot of power over you because these companies have a ton of say over your economy because now you're massively over-leveraged, investing in these companies that are way too expensive for you. But I think they also know that the power that the company has over you, as the leader of this government, is way more than the power that your government has over them. First of all, for exactly the mechanism that they lay out, that you are presumably acting as a bunch of all different countries, which, first of all, have different interests. Malaysia and Uganda probably don't have the same interests. They have different political and economic cycles. But also, the company can just pick you off one by one. That is, maybe you aren't actually effective in threatening them because the company can just bribe one of the countries to pick off their vote and screw over all the other countries. So to the extent that there's a collective action problem, that in order to make any progress and make any of your threats be credible, all the countries have to remain together, it's probably pretty unlikely that that would ever be the case and the company would probably just pick you off one by one. So don't think they've ever proved this. But they also don't engage in what Will tells you about how you really piss people off. Note that this is also an economic impact that cost your economy because if now people are rising up in protest because you spent all the money that should have gone towards schools or roads towards buying Pfizer, which, as they tell you, is actively oppressing you so you probably really hate them to the extent that this is true and you're sending all your money overseas to this company that they say is oppressing you, people are probably going to be really pissed off. It is seen as foreign. It is seen as a vanity project for the politician and there are a lot of other things you could do with that money. I think it's proven to you that as soon as you do this, you might as well be lighting your money on fire. But second, even if you buy the bulk of their argumentation that there are some benefits, why is the comparative preferable? First, on what the comparative actually is. Opening government, I can't believe I have to explain this in world's quarter finals, they get to define their own model, but we have an equal amount of counter-fiat power to define our own model. To the extent that they say, we're going to use X amount of capital or X amount of political capital, which would presumably be a lot because the people in this country hate these companies, we can say we'll just invest that money elsewhere. We're not saying, as they misunderstand and strawman our argument, we're not saying put the money in domestic firms. Rather, we give you a bunch of other options. Actually invest in a diversified group where your only power isn't in the actions of other countries as well. Or you can invest in infrastructure, which unlike stocks that are priced appropriately, actually have a massive growth multiplier. If you spend $100 on some stock, you expect to get $100 back in the future. But these developing countries are exactly the sorts that have infrastructure projects still that haven't been done that have a ton of money available. I also want to point out that they say these countries are really corrupt. But first of all, even corrupt governments can do infrastructure projects. Maybe a little money gets stolen, but the road still gets built. So given there's a massive growth multiplier, it's still probably beneficial for you. But also we tell you if dollars are so important to you, just buy US treasuries instead. Closing.

    > POI: Infrastructure is also a very long-term investment. You try to get it by investing in it, and if you get it by investing in drugs, you could definitely invest in it.

    Look, there's a comparative. I think at least if you're investing in infrastructure, you have a lot more control, and that that infrastructure is at least producing a better benefit at the end. On your side, first of all, stability and long-term investment is one of the things that opening governments said is so good about their case. It's unclear to me if you plan on knifing them in your extension. But second, it's a comparative. To the extent that your money is locked up in a long-term investment, we'd rather it be one that actually pays off in the end and gives you some control over the things that your money is done with. Third major benefit that we got from opening governments is that you stop exploitation. So I want to point out again this internal tension. If this exploitation is actually happening to you, it is probably not the case that it's going to be super easy or super politically palatable for you to spend your money on these stocks in the first place. I'd also want to point out that if the governments they're talking about are so fucking corrupt, these governments probably won't pressure the corporations to do things that are beneficial for the people, like lowering drug prices, but probably do things that lead to kickbacks for the elite and don't actually benefit the countries anyways. I also want to point out once more that it's really strange credulity to imagine a world in which all of these developing countries, all 150 of them, buy tiny little shares in a bunch of diversified small countries because of the collective action problem that we point out. That is to say, it's probably the case that they can't enforce their will on this company because any one of them could immediately get picked off. But I also want to say that why can't you just regulate away the exploitation if it is in fact so important to you? Why do you have to do it in a way that screws up your profits and can get instantly screwed over by any other country in that cohort you're working with screwing you over? Every country in the world basically, except for the United States, has a price cap on pharmaceuticals, unclear why this is not a reasonable solution for your problem. I also want to point out that the reason a lot of countries are buying this exploitation is because they believe that it economically benefits their own countries. You probably don't want to get rid of it at the cost of even more profit for you. I think at the end of the round, that's the way you have to do. First, instantly, does this screw over your economy or send people rising up in a protest in a way that leads to violence that probably gets a lot of people killed, but also screws up your economy as well. But even if it does do some benefits, there are much better places to put it without crowding out the sort of domestic investment that could actually benefit your economy in the long run. That's the part of Wool's extension that went untouched. Proud to oppose.

    We've two things forming closing government. One is respond to both of the burdens OO put on OG, because I think they are quite correct in pointing out that they were not truly fulfilled. Secondly, we're going to go further than OG in showing how the power of control really functions, mechanize that. That's also going to be a lot of answers to OO in there. So, rebuttal is integrated. Let's deal with OO. The first thing they say is, you cannot opt for diversification, right? Because you don't have enough money. We don't say the goal of developing countries here is to gain a share in the world market of multinational corporations. There's usually one corporation which is specifically important to your country based on your geographical location and the one resource you have. So, if you are Nigeria, it's probably going to be Shell. If you are Zambia, it's probably a copper extraction company, right? Given the geological diversity, countries are likely to strategically opt for controlling one of these companies in particular. We do not see why it would be prudent for them to try to control more of them. Secondly, on the idea of what happens to stocks when they are bought. When these stocks are bought and people see that countries are doing this, they're going to massively sell stocks and dividends are going to fall. Three responses to this. One, they probably won't do this, right? Because these people have advisors. They have risk assessment and stuff like this. And they know it's incredibly stupid. Because when everyone starts selling their stocks, then the value of stocks falls for everyone. This means that by selling, you are being part of a process where the value of stocks is generally falling, right? So, it's generally more profitable for you to hold onto the stock than to sell the stock because you know that if you do, you're generally bringing the price of the stock down. But secondly, let me say, even if that happens, we say the amount of control rises, right? So, we don't say that dividend is necessarily the comparative in this debate. The comparative in this debate can be the control of the company. So, if more shareholders sell their stocks, this means the country has a greater share of those stocks, which unmechanize a lot of OO, which says you're not able to get enough of those stocks. So, on OO's side, and note, a lot of their case is premised on these countries being capable enough to make the investments and measures and choices necessary for them to survive. So, these countries are capable to do that. Even if their dividend falls, they have a higher share in the company, which means they can control more of the company's policy and use a lot of the company's money making infrastructure, which is internationally developed, which still exists, right? So, that is the comparative. Thirdly, on their idea that other investors are going to leave and you won't have dividends or FDI at the point where you see a country doing this, they won't because, as you said in your case and at their premise, countries are going to spend a lot of their resources on buying off the shares of one company. Other companies know that the country probably cannot buy off their shares as well, which means that their stocks and their infrastructure in the country is more safe. Then, when you talk about these measures and alternatives, first of all, you see very often countries are incapable of implementing these measures. So, even if they have the money, very often they end up doing things such as pumping incredible amounts of money into one industry and then unintentionally appreciating their currency, leading to stuff like the Dutch disease, leading to their exports being less profitable. We've seen Angola a couple of years ago invest a huge amount of money in urbanizing like areas of their cities and building skyscrapers without realizing that people don't have the purchasing power to buy apartments in those skyscrapers. But, even if the countries are capable, we should very often lock out of the measures that are necessary because of external conditions imposed for bailout packages, imposed for foreign aid by institutions like the IMF and the WTO. This means that nationalization, appreciating or depreciating your currency based on watching you at that point, imposing tariffs, the mechanisms you need for the money for the measures that opening opposition wants, you are locked out of them because your existence depends on you not implementing these measures. This answers their first burden about the economy going down the drain because even if their measures are feasible and are rational, countries cannot do them in the status quo. What is the status quo? Corporations get into these countries. They buy up huge shares of the local market in these resources that are strategically important to countries. This means at that point, they can threaten to leave the country with their capital, with their infrastructure. The country is then between a rock and a hard place because A, it either can't regulate, not just because of the IMF mechanism I gave you, but also because the state captured by these companies, the money that they have, the fact that they are the most profitable industry in the fucking country, the fact that they can lobby, the fact that they can pay off government officials, which is a mechanism all of themselves mentioned, means that the company is deciding where infrastructure is going to be built. The company is deciding how much you're going to tax. The company is deciding how much tariffs you're going to impose, meaning that you don't have control over mechanisms of getting the money that you need for the alternatives that they mentioned on their side of the house. At that point, your only way to gain control is to be able to influence the policy of the company because even if you are able to regulate, and you do regulate, despite the conditions of the IMF and the WTO and the Western countries, then you are painted as a big state dictator, then your political risk assessment goes down, your credit rating goes down, you will not get loans because you're a big regulator, and investors are not sure when you're going to regulate, when you're going to nationalize, and stuff like this. So companies do not have a choice in the status quo. What are the responses we get? From the CO, we get the idea of, but what happens if we have a recession? A U.S. recession happened in 2008. These companies did not go bankrupt for a number of reasons. One, they can still get loans on the global financial market. Two, they have assets they can sell. Three, they're the most likely to get bailed out. Four, they have contingency funds for these sort of situations, so they're not likely to fail, and this also answers to if they want countries to engage in the financial market as alternatives, this also answers like four reasons OG doesn't give you as to why these are the most profitable and stable investments. What we get from OO then is, ah, backlash. Look, backlash doesn't happen these days. So you have corrupt regimes fighting civil wars, pumping money into their relatives, not building roads, people don't have food, people don't have water, people don't have medicine, but now, when they start imposing this policy, ah, that's the tipping point. That's going to bring them over the edge. Come on. Before I move on to extending, yeah.

    > (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)

    In this case, in this scenario, you are following the market mechanism, you're engaging on the free market, you're buying off stocks, this is not the same thing as imposing a law which nationalizes a company. But a second answer to you, even if it's diversified, right, and a single company can have a bigger share, we say that developing countries are likely to cartelize, but OO doesn't really give you a mechanism on this, because it's not just common interest. We agree with how Malaysia and Uganda don't have common interest, but they said there are political mechanisms in place in specific regions which enforce this common interest, right, things such as the African Union. So countries have common interests in specific regions, and investors know that there is a political mechanism, a political body which can specifically be used as a forum to create this policy. Now, given that shareholders do not want to sell their shares, because they want to hold on to them, they know these are profitable companies, and they want to have these long-term investments, they're more likely to act preemptively, right, to give higher wages, to follow some environmental regulations, because they don't want to antagonize an entire political body of countries which has shown to be homogenous in the past. But there are other benefits here. One is companies need to give quarterly and monthly reports to their shareholders, right. So this means that you're more likely to see the flow of money within the corporation. This means if you bring a lawsuit against the corporation in an arbitration within an FDA or something like that, you have more evidence to prove they screwed you over. If the people of Nigeria, as they have, bring a lawsuit against Shell, then this means that they also have more info to bring their case to court. But finally, companies are required to give out plans to their shareholders. So you have more information on the individual level as to what the company is going to do within your country, which means that within all those framework countries have the capacity to react. You have more information upon which to react. This means the closing government should be through in this debate. Thank you.

    We're closing our session with three things in this debate. We'll first of all quickly finish this idea of economic development and why this is not a good model for doing that. Secondly, we will look specifically at the competitive interest that this creates and why that is particularly harmful and actually sets back all of those benefits of economic development that our European government tries to get in this debate. Finally, we'll look at the democratic impact that this has on a lot of these countries and why that is problematic. Most of the rebuttal is integrated. Just finally, a little bit of extension we got right at the end there about being able to see the reports and the money that these companies have. Publicly listed companies have to present those reports to everyone. Those are publicly available for all investors. Therefore, everyone can see those already. That is fine. We know what they are doing. That's not a particularly huge benefit. So we can move on to that. Let's go to the economic development. So first of all, let's go through why this dependence and this debt is bad. So first and foremost, because as we say, many of these countries will need to go into debt, are already in debt and need to pay off that debt and that the interest rates on that is going to be lower than the short-term dividends that they are getting back from the money that they are getting in these stocks. So that means they are actually going further and further into debt as a result of this, which as they concede to the government, they've already got a bad enough debt rating and that is going to be particularly problematic for them and for somebody in a worse position. It makes it harder for them to get the money they need. But especially in the case of a financial crisis, what do we get from closing government in response to this though? They say, well, some of these companies didn't go bust in the GFC. If you think of this, one of their mechanisms was bailouts. We think that there is less incentive for the US government to bail out to a company that is mostly propping up a foreign country. So we think this is going to be one of the first ones that is actually cut and is allowed to fail on their side of the house, which means you've exposed yourself, but you do not get those protections. Secondly, we heard there is an eventual recovery. But if, as opening government says, we are so dependent on this investment income that comes from the dividends, that is still a long time that we have a large amount of money that we could have had before not coming back in the door. So we think that that is problematic. But also in that short-term, when someone is evaluating our risk rating for getting further credit, which we might need for the cash that is required for something like a stimulus package, and they think that the majority of our government's extra money is currently locked up in shares that they're not sure the companies are necessarily going to recover from, that hurts the interest rates that we are going to get in those places as well, which means that also we aren't able to do the effective stimulus to get us out of those sorts of things. So given that they are so exposed, this makes them more exposed, and means that they are unable to get out of that in any meaningful way. Let's now move to the conflict of interest. So first of all, this debate about regulation, because the problem for opening government in this debate is they wanted to both get huge economic development but also massive regulation. The problem is massive regulation is massively uncompetitive and therefore hurts the economic benefits that we get there, so we do not think that they would be able to do that. But it gives them a conflict of interest on that front. We think that this stops them from doing a lot of the things they may have done legislatively. What do we get preemptively from opening government first on this? We say that we can't do it in the status quo because of the US and the IMF, and we get from closing government that we will lose the company in the status quo if we do these sorts of things. All of those same harms exist on both sides and do not change by any meaningful way. On the one of a company leaving the closing government gives us, we probably don't have the power by opening government's model of holding 3% by every single developing country in each company. We don't see why Nicaragua cares about a company leaving from Nigeria or something like that. So they're not going to have the ability to stop that same thing from happening that is symmetrical therefore on both sides. On the US and the IMF, this just shows how dangerous this model is, because now those countries also know that you are in charge of major companies in their economy, which means they've got more incentive to exert that exact influence over you and stop you from doing that sort of regulation, but also now you have the added harm that you would also be tanking your own economy. Next let's talk about competition and basic needs though in this conflict of interest, because this is a big one that has been entirely untouched in this debate, is that a lot of these companies are also providers into a lot of these countries, and this changes the efficiency of a lot of very essential services. A very simple example of this is the healthcare system, given that a lot of the debate has been about things, in fact every government talks about trying to get cheaper drugs into the healthcare system. The problem is that now you aren't necessarily choosing the cheapest drug into your healthcare system, because if you are an investor in a certain company, you are likely to choose that one because that immediately gets flowbacks to you, so you will do that even if it is not the cheapest one and the most efficient one for your system. But secondly, as we've already seen in the behaviour of drug companies, there are a whole lot of competitions between things like actually providing vaccines versus providing cures. If you own Pfizer and they have a whole lot of cures and treatments for something, but they also have the vaccine, you may not put the vaccine into your country, because doing that might take out a huge market for one of the major drugs that your company sells. Given that we already know these drug companies by open government's concession are doing this, now we make these governments also in that and either have to choose to destroy their economy or destroy their healthcare system and the various other systems that are reliant on these sorts of services. Before I move on to the democratic impacts of this, I'm having to take POI from closing.

    > (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)

    So that assumes they will spend it stupidly, and we've given you lots of reasons why we could still spend it in other ways that are better than the status quo, but not this model, which is worse than the status quo. But the other thing is, they probably have less faith in that as a result of this, because the extra mechanism we give, which is now that company is unlikely to get a bailout compared to all the other big drug companies there that are not foreign owned by all these other countries. So therefore, that mechanism may have worked in the last GSE, but it wouldn't work once you enact this model. Let's move on to the democratic impact of this. And first of all, we'll wade into the debate on corruption. So we think that the corruption gets worse on their side because companies are still able to bribe those board reps to get the votes that they want to do these sorts of things. And so far as they can do that at the moment, we think it becomes less transparent and harder to see. But also because, even if this works, this centralises control in a huge way, unlike all the other forms of development and investment that we could do in this case. Because if we take all of these large amounts of money that are in these sovereign wealth funds according to open government, all that we're just going to have to borrow from various other governments around the world, then we put them into something that just pays more dividends back into that government, and it becomes cyclical there and keeps that government money concentrated there. Other forms of development that our side supports in this debate make those capital expenses go into the economy of that country and takes it decentralised from that government, which gives them this ability to immediately take the profits and continue to engage in these sorts of corruption that exist there. It undermines the inequality that tends to come from these sorts of things by them being able to engage in the cronyism. Insofar as opening government wants to say that all these governments are already corrupt and that's why we need this, the worst thing we can do is give them a giant share portfolio that they are the only ones that they have control over and visibility over as well. The last thing that we'd add on this is the other reason why this is anti-democratic is that it gives a massive apparatus for state control in the worst places as well. We do not want corrupt governments owning a large share in Google and choosing things like how Google uses its search algorithms and presents news to people because that is the exact sort of thing that they do at the moment who try and stop any sort of protest or any sort of opposition to their regime. The problem is that now they can allow people to access Google, they don't have to shut down the internet which often gets huge backlash, but they can still control what everyone gets there, they shut down the information. This doesn't get any economic development, it sets it back and it sets back democracy. We oppose.

    Viewpoints on closing opposition and then straight into that. Two things. First of all, closing opposition says that we're going to choose to take subpar products which are horrible for our people, but they're going to destroy the company. Notice one thing. The MNCs we're talking about have billions and billions and billions of dollars in profits and even if we force them to take a price that is 10% cheaper, the impact in the end for this specific company is absolutely zero. They're going to lose 1% of the profit, but this means nothing to them. Therefore, we do not have a risk of destroying our entire economy when we do this. What we do is we will likely prioritize our own people, therefore get a bit cheaper medicine. Second point on the idea of centralized control. We say that local politicians are much more often corrupt. They're much more often the ones who do something worse for their people. There are multiple reasons for this. It's easier for you as a local and a regional strong person to control this because you know the people in your local community. You can much easier bribe them off than someone in a centralized government that needs to bribe the entire state. Therefore, it's much harder for you. What does this mean? This means that centralized control is more often something that you want as a state. You want this centralized government to actually be able to impose certain measures to not lose the money to corruption and therefore fight this corruption. This means that the investment, if it is much more centralized, is much better for you as a state. First of all, on the idea of your framework, and this is something that Tim tells you. What this looks like. This looks like you actually being able to name the board members, to name the people who are going to make the decisions, or to name the supervisory board. This is what Tim talks about in his last minutes of speech, so please do not dismiss it outright. This means that you know what's happening. Even if you have these reports, you have people who you can nominate into this, who are the ones who can then tell you when these abuses happen. And this is what Tim tells you when he explicitly says, now you can name the board members. In this we see that you have a lot more information as a state. Okay, few things in this speech. And this is directly enabling the government case to actually function. Without this analysis, the entire government bench falls. First of all, will the investors absolutely run? And what's going to happen if they run? We say, first of all, these companies have such huge profit margins, that even if these countries achieve everything they want, it's unlikely for other investments to flee. Because they see that there is still an opportunity for huge profit in the long run. Therefore, they're unlikely to do this. Second of all, what we say, even if they leave, this is good for our case, but highly unlikely. So if they leave, this means that we can buy even more of these companies, we can take even more control. But notice, companies do not make profit based on their dividend, based on their stock share. They make it based on the things they produce and the things they sell. This means that even if your stock share is very low, you can still produce the same thing because your factories exist, your companies still exist, and therefore this means that these countries will get even more profit in the long run if this happens, because they can buy more shares, get more profit, get more dividends, and get more control. This means that if this happens, absolutely great for us. Second. They say the comparative for both teams is in turn wealth investment. OG says, oh, but there is bribery, there is corruption. They never actually explain how proficient, how huge of an issue this is, and how this specifically works. What we say, when you have local plans, you first of all need to bribe local politicians to actually accept this policy. You need to push it through. This means that you as the central government need to spend money on actually pushing your policies through. Second of all, when you assign it to local areas, then these local areas and their powerful people in them assign this to their own companies, their own henchmen. This means that the cost of the product is often 10 or 20 times higher than it is because they can simply force the money more and more. This means that you lose a lot of money in the process. This is money you can never lose if you invest into the MNC. Because you simply put this money into the MNC, then you get the dividends back. You cannot lose it on corruption, which means that in the end you have a lot more. Second of all, people want stupid projects. That's very simple, because people only see their immediate needs. I need a hospital right here, regardless if this is a town of 2,000 people. I want my hospital, regardless if it's profitable in the end. So what does this mean? This means that the specific project I will vote for and the specific project I will get is not something which is ever going to help my country as a whole. My politicians are going to vote it in, and then we're not going to do anything else. This is what Tim talks about when he talks about Angola and the investments they make. This is a specific new way in which this happens. Okay. Yes.

    > (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)

    So if what you say in the investors run is true, I'm going to be able to buy it much more cheaper later on, and then I'm going to be able to get even more profits. So if everything they say is true about investors running, our case is much stronger. Because then I later on get to buy it more cheaply, and therefore get a lot more dividends in return. One more point of response to OG and the money being tied up. Infrastructure projects take 10 to 20 to 30 years to actually finish, to build a highway, to build a full port system for your country. This is the time you have your money tied up and you get zero returns at all. When you have dividends, you at least get it every single year back. This is not a huge sum which you do not continuously get back. And notice the infrastructure projects are often horrible for these countries. But second of all, if a crisis occurs and our money is tied up, the foreign investors and foreign banks know that this money is tied up into the large MNCs they trust, because they trust Pfizer, they trust Shell to live. This means that they believe that in the long run, we are able to get our returns in the very long run. But if we are Zimbabwe, nobody is likely to believe that Zimbabwe is not going to default. This means that if we spend our money on our products, we're not going to get any foreign loans with a good currency, because they're likely to believe that we're going to fail immediately. Therefore, we're a much better investment for these companies, for banks. We get more better loans, and in doing so, we have a higher chance of actually getting out of the crisis. Thirdly, on the idea of the safety of investment. Once again, OG says and asserts these companies will always be bailed out. But the analysis on why this happened never exists, because the reason for the bank bailout and for every single bailout is to protect your own citizens. We still work in those companies. We still have money in those banks. And this is something which does not change regardless of what CO says, because I still have my money in the largest banks of the USA. I still work in Shell in the USA, and these governments have a huge incentive to not let this happen. This demolishes a majority of COs' case. And lastly, what Tin brings to you, and which is an additional something that we bring, is the idea of individual consolation. Even if everything opposition claims is true, we still have more insight into these companies. We can, on an individual level, see who they're trying to corrupt. We can see the individual things happening, and in doing so, we have a higher likelihood of actually stopping them. By having this opportunity, uncontingent of anything else in the debate, we show you an additional crucial benefit. Thank you.

    This debate suffers from an actor problem. The government bench assumes that the people that are making decisions on behalf of countries are acting exclusively in the interests of those countries. But we demonstrate to you that they do not. In fact, they often act selfishly in a way that means that this investment will be used to entrench the position of these governments, will be used to entrench the profits of these companies, and the subsequent revenue flows that allow for the flourishing of corruption and an enormous amount of damage to human development. I'm going to look at two things in this speech. The first will be on government and corporate behavior, and the second, far less important question, will be about the various profitability of this set of investments. Firstly, opening government begins this important question with two claims. The first is that you want to get this money away from corruption, and the second is that you want to retain control of your country from companies that are going to enter and subsequently have large impacts on the quality of life of people in your country. We explain both of these fails. First, because we demystify what an investment is, it is just a cash flow. And insofar as a country has become systematically corrupt, we identify for you that it is extraordinarily simple for those highly valuable dollars to be taken by the bureaucrat whose name is on the account or who's got the finger on the pulse. And the opposition never overcomes this rather simple analysis that the same process of theft would be quite simple. Secondly, we explain that accountability in terms of control of the country from companies is implausible because the companies are capable of still providing bribes to the individuals that are participants in the people that are individually voting. Now crucially, we also explain that that mechanism is diversified depending on which of the government ventures models you want. If you believe that it is only as closing government seems to believe, you buy a large stake in a domestically important industry that isn't regionally significant, then you can really work on the one person who is going to be taking a bribe, who is going to be going into that environment and be highly effective for them. If instead you believe it is that every developing country buys a tiny fraction of every single company, then the board rep for that company is going to be extraordinarily easy to bribe because there are probably a large number of people that are tasked with doing that in the government and the amount of democratic accountability per one is likely to be extraordinarily low, which means this is not going to be effective at doing any of the things that opening government says because they are correct. These countries gain shareholder rights via sales and control, which notably is better than closing government who are incorrect when they say this gives useful new amounts of information as Dom demolished in a sentence and then government whip inexplicably bookmarked his speech with, but they will not use that capacity because they have absolutely no incentive to use that capacity because the actor that is tasked with making these decisions will not do so. Closing government maybe gets a little bit closer when they talk about how political bodies may have some degree of oversight, but given the complexity of the arrangement that I have already articulated, it is impossible to believe that this is the case. John then explains in a positive fashion how this perverts the choice of governments and companies through a variety of vaccines that government whip entirely refuses to engage with. He tells you that there is an inherent conflict of interest between corporate profit and social well-being and when government agents that now get the benefits of corporate profit, but are not accountable as they are often faceless corporate bureaucrats, often not even in democracies, that decision is made in favor of the corporate profit now, not even of your domestic firm where that money is still invested, but instead largely in favor of fucking Americans, right? Which is, I think, as my experience of this tournament has articulated, is not the best. So then, Dom explains to you that it is difficult to regulate these companies. Dom explains to you that often these, and sorry, Dom also explains, by the way, that this goes both ways, right? That these companies additionally often have the incentive if there is a large shareholding provided, for example, Google's news algorithm or any news organization or Pfizer's provisions of drugs provincially in terms of propping up people that are your sectarian allies or in terms of any company's provision where they need to decide which region of that company they provide it to and you encourage them as a stockholder who has power over them to provide it to somebody who is in your interest, no, thank you, you will do that. Which means this goes both ways. These companies become captured by corporations and these corporations become cronies in the corruption of the government and this issue is just more important than who is able to make money for two crucial reasons. Firstly, because democracy breaks almost every right that you have. Democracy breaks, sorry, corruption breaks your right to democracy. It means that money from the state is devoted to areas that it shouldn't be. It means that your economy becomes less efficient to invest in and the like. But secondly, because insofar as we needed the valuable and stable American dollars that are provided by the government venture side, which is seemingly their biggest business, you can just invest in an index fund, which is just a company that obscures the function that we are describing here. Now, the thing obviously to notice is that opening opposition did the bare minimum in terms of having a counter model, but then did not explain how that counter model is able to satisfy the functions that these guys want without achieving the harms that we describe. Opening.

    I feel like this material died about half an hour ago, right? I think it died in a relatively intuitive way. It's like there is not a great deal of political support associated with making investments in foreign companies, particularly if the extension that we have provided you is literally at all true. People will now understand that this is just businessmen in suits palling around with your leader. Comparatively, at least it's domestic, at least the benefit is captured, and at least there is a guarantee that that company's outcomes are divorced from the outcomes of your corrupt government. That is why it would be comparatively more popular. Now onto the value of the amount of money here. Don describes that these companies will become less valuable as they are owned less domestically because the incentive to bail them out diminishes. And closing governments' whip stuff about how you are able to buy into the company when it has lost half of its value and make more money is truly insane because obviously if the value of a company has collapsed, that implies that the predicted share prices in the future are either uncertain or low, which is why that big prong of their extension really missed Econ 101. The second thing that they say is obviously that we say this subsequently makes your credit ratings way worse, which deepens problems of structural crises and greater indebts you to the IMF, as the closing government is deeply afraid of, because it means that in circumstances of crises you are substantially more exposed to global contagion. Now, to talk briefly about opening government, the problem with all of their analysis on this score is that they are describing how individual investments that are designed to serve certain purposes only serve one purpose, and then their complaint is that they fail to do all of them. For example, they say bonds don't have as high yields, but they provide American dollars. Or they say investments in domestic industries are more predictable, but they provide liquid stimulus. And the thing is that they're just saying that these companies do some of these things, but all investment classes have all different purposes, but the harms that we describe are unique to this investment class. You don't want to fuck up the country, and that is why you need to oppose. Thank you.

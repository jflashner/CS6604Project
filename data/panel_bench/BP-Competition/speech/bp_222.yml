    People matter. People from all walks of life need to believe that all of this has meaning, that they are here for a reason, that their experience has achieved something, and that they are valid. Well, that's what we support on side-opening government with these religions that tell people to center themselves rather than to read. Three points of setup before moving Firstly, we think centering the self is not about selfishness at the expense of others, because obviously when you believe that all individuals have meaning, when they are all capable of forming relationships with God or gods or whatever so-called spirituality they believe in, you obviously have to believe that other people's experiences are also valid and important, is not something that you can actively reject and undermine. Secondly, we think the number of people in each world who are religious is likely to be fairly symmetric because of other pressures like cultural norms, like religious expectations. We think this is a debate mostly about the quality of religion rather than sort of the quantity of belief. But thirdly, we think the metric for this debate is that we think religion is broadly a pretty good force for a lot of people's lives, it helps people get a lot better. We think that is what we're defending. Otherwise, I will make three arguments. Firstly, why religions that tell you to center yourself are far more accessible and far more easy to opt into for a huge number of people. Secondly, why when people do opt in, their internal emotional resonance and experience of spirituality is far better in our world. Thirdly, it's harder to weaponize religion until you center yourself by bad actions. And we think the metric here is basically that people often form incredibly meaningful connections based on their spirituality with the world around them, often in times when they have very little else, when they perhaps live in poverty. We think it is good to give people the option and the easy access to religions that are broadly speaking pretty good. Four main reasons as to why we think we get better accessibility are as follows. Firstly, every single person around the world, no matter what circumstances they live in, has subjective experiences that they can draw meaning from. Not everybody can align with objective doctrine. For instance, if the Bible is pretty explicit that if you are gay, that is something that you cannot opt into, and that's the fashion, that is obviously pretty bad. But everybody has experiences of the subjective. Everybody has different beliefs about what is sacred, what is meaningful, what brings them closer to God or the gods or whatever equivalent spirituality they believe in. Every single person, by default, has access. That is something that the opposition bench can never claim, because inherently you have to believe that you serve some greater purpose in some more specific controlled fashion. That is far harder to access for the vast majority of people, particularly people, for instance, who don't align with traditional sort of gender nor cultural norms. That is something that is quite bad. And I want to pre-empt here that some opposition teams, well, it gives people a sense of a greater purpose, and that is quite meaningful, particularly for people who don't have a lot going for them in this life. But we say that it's especially important to make it as accessible as possible for people to believe in religions. Even if they don't necessarily have the best material conditions, it is still meaningful to give them a more spiritual and more deep and meaningful connection there. We don't think they necessarily need to believe that there is a better life for them when this religion provides them happiness in the immediate. The second reason for why is that there is simply a broader range of beliefs that are acceptable, because there is no concrete correct way to believe. There is no one there to tell you what you're experiencing is invalid. You are not actually a true believer in this religion. That is obviously really good, because it is much harder to be challenged, for instance, on the basis of whether you are a true believer. It is harder for people to attack what is often a very core facet of your identity, which is incredibly emotionally devastating. Thirdly, this religion just has a better image to people who aren't already believers, right? Because when the religion inherently believes that people matter and people's values and experiences are important, rather than outright rejecting them, that means it is perceived as a less cruel and cold and callous religion. You're far less prone to, you know, get rejected when people try to opt into it. You're far more likely to be interested and at least open to hearing some of the ideas of that religion, which can enrich people's life and experience meaningfully. But fourthly, it's just less miserable, right? If you're constantly worn down by the expectation that you should be sacrificing because your individuality doesn't matter, because there is no value in the self, you know, that is just an incredibly oppressive lifestyle to live. I know that's particularly bad for people who can't really opt out of religion because of things like familial expectations and cultural norms. If your religion is actively making you miserable by telling you that you as an individual do not matter, we think that is particularly bad. That is likely to lead to people to feeling hopeless, to feeling depressed, to feeling lost. That is the biggest difference in this debate. We make religion far more easy to opt into. We make it far less miserable once people are in there. We're moving on to the second point. Closing.

    > POI: Do you support religions or do you think religions are a bad thing? Which of the two is it?

    As I pretty clearly state and set up, we support religions. We would just support religions being better than, you know, oppressive, you know, suffocating religions. I don't think that's a particularly effective way of life. Second substantive argument on internal emotional resonance and why people believe in more meaningful ways. Three reasons for this. Firstly, they are validated for what they have been through in their own personal life and that means that people from all walks of life are able to opt into religion. They're able to come to a more sensitive and more deep and meaningful and nuanced engagement with their spirituality. That looks like, for instance, being a, you know, for example, a gay Muslim and being able to believe that this offers you some unique sort of spiritual connection to your particular religious beliefs. That is something that is exclusively available on the government. Secondly, it doesn't deny people their suffering by telling them that it doesn't matter. And it's incredibly, I think it's just incredibly harmful for people to have their problems trivialized and telling them that not only is your suffering something that you simply have to endure, but something that is actively justified because, you know, you'll be rewarded in the next life, for example, or because it doesn't matter at all. Obviously that is incredibly demeaning and demands a huge sacrifice and burden from people that we just think has no real payoff or benefit for them. We think it is obviously pretty bad to tell people that when they live a life of misery, that they actively deserve it. We obviously, we can remove that from people's individual experiences ascent and consider it important. Thirdly, we just think it's a more empowering narrative because it suggests that you have agency over your own life, your connections, the way that you opt into religion matter. You are in control of your own destiny rather than, you know, subject to the, you know, the whims of a cruel universe. That is something that is incredibly empowering that makes people feel far less miserable about their life. That is why people's internal emotional resonance and the way they are spiritual is far better in our world. Finally, let's talk about this is why a world in which religion says the self is better, is harder for people, bad actors to weaponize. We think the counterfactual here, as I've already sort of implicitly alluded to, is that there's a focus on sort of, you know, maybe there's meaning in the next life or there's some greater purpose for you as an individual and yourself in your own experiences matter very little. But the problem with that, the problem with that is that that great, even though it's like the opposition to in this debate argue, well, that greater purpose is meaningful. I can't control how that greater purpose is decided and how it's manifested. We say it is determined by the religious powers that be that are often fairly heavily included with things like society and politics in ways that are quite harmful for two reasons. Firstly, as I already flagged, it's often politically intertwined. If religion is used to motivate and rally voters, it's used to justify conflict. For instance, look at the religious narratives between, for example, the conflict between Iran and Israel. Obviously, it is incredibly bad when centralized actors are able to take control of this narrative of what spirituality actually means. They're able to weaponize it to make people more violent, more hostile, more willing to reject other religions and say they are wrong. But secondly, we just think inherently othering narratives saying that if you, you know, individuals and their own interpretations do not matter, it's easier to say, well, if individuals don't matter, then their interpretation is wrong and therefore they are lesser than people, they are less than me. That means it's far easier to other them and make them the enemy. At the end of this speech, it's pretty clear. People matter. We should make them happy. We should make them believe that they matter. That is why we propose.

    Firstly, OG rather is out because this motion is not this house regrets organized religion. Wouldn't it be great if everyone could believe whatever they want? And then like, everyone will go to heaven. Everyone will think that it's okay to be gay. And that's great. Christianity is something government defends because Christianity tells you you matter. Your choices matter. They will determine what happens to you in the eye. And we as Christians are very interested in what gets on. We defend things like Buddhism, where everyone is part of this whole wheel. And everyone, my knowledge of Buddhism is slightly rudimentary. So apologies if I misrendered it. Everyone is less important. What happens to you is of less importance than in general of removing suffering, of you just having the right way of life, but there's much less pressure to conform to that. I think this undercuts the vast majority of the material they want to talk about under their side of the house. First question, under which side do people feel better on this question about whether or not you can have your subjective experiences be good? The info slide says your experiences are special, but special just means of special importance and not necessarily good or bad, right? It is important that you get the correct, like you have the correct experiences in order for you to be saved in order for you to go to heaven. But for that to be a thing that you spend a lot of life worrying about, it must be the case that you could not go to heaven. Otherwise no one actually pays a lot of attention to this question, which means that for some people, it must be possible for them not to go to heaven. That is why religion still has a large amount of power to prescribe what is the correct way of living. What is the optimal special experience with God under their side, which means that I don't think they get access for the benefits they want to talk about. By contrast, I think we get some more level of inclusion under our side when it is less important, right? Because it could still be the case that we deem the thing that I participate in to be an evil under our side, because there still can be a prescriptive view of what is good or bad for the world, even if it's not good or bad to me. The extent to which I personally feel like I am a bad person, because the thing that I do directly ties to consideration of what I'm like, whether or not I will go to heaven or hell is much weaker. So individual sins are much less likely to make people question whether or not they actually fit within the religion. So people who differ slightly are much, much more likely to be able to access belief and much harder to discriminate under our side of the house. Secondly, why do we like religion? We like religion because it makes people happy primarily, and it makes an awful lot of people happy. I think there are two reasons that it can make people happy. Firstly, a sense of community, which is probably symmetric or something we will win under our side, because you're more likely to care about your neighbors, believe they're important, rather than to be particularly selfish, like spying on them and check whether or not they conform to the priest's instructions. But secondly, and relevantly, is it as a way of making you feel better when things otherwise are going badly. Because religion sure can be like an extra cherry on top if I'm happy, but it's much more important to make me believe my life's all right, everything will be fine when I really am in tough circumstances. Here's the problem with opening government. It is not clear why being told my suffering now is special will make me believe it, right? You could tell me that like the fact that I broke my foot is actually a wonderful thing for me. I don't fucking believe you. I can walk for several months. It sucks. So I'm not sure they actually get solvency. Why do we think comparatively it is much easier to believe that this is of less importance than to believe this is something that is actively good, which is something they're committed to under their side of the house, because like the way the world is, is special. And often because we try and prioritize the narrative that you need to achieve going to heaven as a thing, often these things get framed as tests or things you should actually celebrate in your life, because that is how you're going to prove you're going to go to heaven. That's, for instance, what happens a lot in Abrahamic religions. Firstly, it is easier because that is the way people currently behave. When bad things happen to me, my predisposition is to try and avoid those things, not to think about these things, but there is a real psychological limit to your ability to gaslight yourself into believing that pain or hunger is the thing that is actively good for you. So we actually have a narrative which coincides with the way that people generally tend to overcome these things. Sure, it might be avoiding the problem. We don't really care, given often, and we'll talk about this later, the thing that they tell you to do on Gov is not solve this circumstance, go see a doctor, but rather you just live with this and keep praying because that's what God told you to do. But secondly, because when there's a correct way to deal with this, that's just an additional layer of stress that makes people even more unhappy, right? When you're poor, you're worried, is this some sign that God does not particularly love me? Rather than believing this is just some symptom of a global system where individual behaviors are very unlikely to cause it, so people feel better. Secondly, religions are substantially less oppressive and are much more likely to actually appeal to poor people. Government might say, although they haven't so far, that when you're told that your individual circumstances do matter, the fact that you are in poverty is much more of an immediate harm and you're likely to see it as a religious harm. But we think this is not the likely way that these things are going to go because religions tend to like the status quo to an immense amount. Firstly, because when people are poor, they're much more likely to believe in gods for the reason I told you, that religion is less important to yourself at the point where you're happy. Secondly, because the most powerful religions, the ones that have the most impact, are usually the ones that have large amounts of state support and therefore are set up in order to preserve the state. But thirdly, because religious leaders are often able to make themselves wealthy because they're local celebrities, a lot of power over people, which means that they like the fact they are able to extract money from poor people. I'll take closing.

    > POI: Yeah, in Buddhism, people often say that if you do bad things, you're going to be reincarnated as a cockroach. Why does that not similarly scare people into behaving?

    Like, to the extent that that might be true, that there is a reason why Buddhism conforms to the government side. So maybe Buddhism is not the best example of an opposition religion, but we would say that if it did not tell you that fact, if it just said we care about other people, we care about the world, that would actually be preferable. I don't get this POI. To be clear, this suggests that when religions say your experiences matter, they are more likely to tell you that these things are actually good than tell you they are actually bad. So the religion under their side will not be an organizing force for making people's real conditions better. For sure, it is not the case that we are any better, right? It is still the case that organizations in our religions are still going to have incentives to support hierarchical structures and hierarchical societies, but people are still going to be intrinsically selfish under both sides. Religion never has so much power over people, and I think it's something both top half teams have conceded, that you're going to believe it's okay for you to be poor, it's okay for you to be hungry. The difference is that when you particularly are worried about what will happen to you and very concerned about that, your ability to be threatened by the religion to say, God will abandon you if you behave a certain way, God will send you to hell if you behave a certain way, forces people to conform to the status quo, which means that they are less likely to improve their own selves, to do what they perceive to be the most important thing, to improve their own lives under our side of the house. What are the impacts of these arguments? Firstly, people probably do things to improve their own lives, often things like advocating for better circumstances. They are happier under our side because they're less likely to see the conflicts between their own intuitions and their religion. But secondly, it's less easy to pressure people to things like frivolous donations that in many cases just constitute taxes on poor people that are wealthy. Hire up people very wealthy because it's much harder to persuade someone if you can't tell them they're going to go to hell to part with large sums of their cash. But thirdly, people are much more likely to push for change. This probably moderates the religion because if people don't believe them and you can't enforce going to hell as a way to force them to believe you, you're now much more likely to become more moderate, to push for or support poor people in your advocacy so that they keep coming back to your church. In the long run, this means that you're more likely to get some minor reforms in government, you're more likely to have wealth redistribution, you're less likely to have regressive taxation. Very proud to oppose.

    For poor minority communities, when they face substantial suffering and misery, the far more accessible narrative is not to try and convince those people that there's some greater purpose here, that you know, your life isn't that important. There's something bigger out there that you're kind of missing the picture of. It is the far more resonant narrative, which is to say, no, your personal experience does really matter. To tell each and every individual that despite their suffering, despite their misery, their experiences are no less important and no less meaningful to their connection to God than anyone else's experiences. Side opening opposition seems to think that if you are poor, and like, are suffering, what this does is gaslight you to think life is okay. No, what it does is allows you to focus on what actually makes you or gives you meaning in life, whether that is your incredibly close relationship to your child, whether you look back at your friendships and your post romantic relationship, and think to yourself how much meaning and how much hope that gives you in that life, whether that is your conscience and your morality, thinking to yourself that you gave what little you had to try and give your children the best life they possibly could have. By opening opposition's own mechanism in the state, that individuals fixate on what gives them hope, what gives them meaning, that is why they will always turn to the positive personal experiences that each and every individual has, regardless of how much suffering they face in the world, that is what they will look at and say, this is what makes me a religious and pious person, this is what gives me my connection to God, this is why I still continue to live this life, despite that suffering, that is why always biggest harm in the state of, oh, we gaslight people into suffering and being okay with that suffering is clearly outrageous. What else does someone give up? Firstly, they explain that religions are going to be prescriptive under both sides of the world, congratulations opening opposition, that is why we gave the argument that it is easier to weaponize, it is easier to create societal narratives when they are religions that do not focus on the individual experience, and instead say there is some greater good or some greater meaning out there that individual experience doesn't matter. Why is that true? They give the example of Buddhism, which is a slam-dunk-for-side opening government, because it is Buddhism that asks the greatest sacrifices upon individuals, it tells monks that they need to rigorously follow hundreds of rules and you need to follow across your life you ever want to achieve a meaningful reincarnation. It is one of the most dogmatic religions in saying that you have a certain right way of conducting that life, that there are certain better and more objectively correct metrics that individuals ought to be following. If you do not, then you are a less pious person. We say that it is explicitly Buddhism, that is not the happy individualist kind of narrative that side opening opposition seems to think it is, it is one of the most brutal religions being incredibly fervently dogmatic. Look at examples like Tibet or Sri Lanka, we say it is actually Christianity. If you want to use that example, that is the prime example of a religion that is far more tolerant. There is a reason why there are so many denominations of Christianity, there is a reason why there are so many totally inconsistent narratives that Christianity has under its broad church, that is because Catholicism and Christianity are religions that obviously still have a hierarchical nature and still are organised religions. Well done. They are far more individual though, they therefore have far more tolerance to allow individuals to be able to access personal narratives. The big mechanism they do not respond to from the prime minister is one where it is far easier to politically weaponise, far easier to say that it is okay to sacrifice certain individuals for some other good, some other religious purpose in life. That is one that directly often explicitly targets minorities by telling those minorities that they are specifically not making the right decision and not making the sets of sacrifices that they ought to be, but explicitly it is one that is so much easier to weaponise, particularly by local religious leaders that are seeking further publicity, seeking further funding, seeking further power within their religious organisations. They are often the most fervent in utilising the fact of their control of what is that greater purpose to make individuals sacrifice more. We say that ESL is incapable. I'll take a closing.

    > POI: So, I may be ESL and an idiot, but please explain to me your mechanism of coercion. Why on your side of the house somehow magically you have more coercive power than tangible material consequences and impacts? Please clear it out for me.

    I'm not entirely sure what this POI is driving at, but to be honest, it's just like personal experiences exist to people. Presumably religion has incentives to include as many people as possible because that is how it gains influence and power in society. To the extent that there are a broad church of personal experiences that individuals have, that the church is more willing to give leniency of which personal experiences give individuals hope, which personal experiences make that meaningful connection to God, then some greater narrative which needs to objectively be tied to some metric that all individuals can follow. Otherwise, their sense of personal self-sacrifice doesn't matter. What else does side of the opposition tell us? They tell us that God will be more punitive, that there are greater power for external pressures, but we've already explained why the opposite is true. Why it's harder to coerce individuals who believe that their connection to God is purely personal or at least somewhat personal. He's less capable of influencing or shifting them to tell them that their relationship doesn't matter. But secondly, opening opposition says, look, what happens here is it's easier to moderate these religions. It's easier to hold them to account, but the opposite is true because your religion by necessity needs to tell individuals, it needs to be extreme enough to tell individuals that their individual life does not matter, that there is something greater outside of that religion. This is one by default that lacks moderating capacity of saying that individual experience matters, whereas ours is not true. Ours can say that both individual experiences and some greater sense of purpose does also matter. And it is deeply unclear, therefore, that ours is not far more capable of moderating that force of saying, yes, personal experiences matter and you should focus on the personal experiences that help others that are less selfish and are more inclined to, for instance, build on your family connection. Finally, what else can we give in this way? First, I want to explain that the opposition also has a capacity problem because they never really explain why, for instance, the most privileged people are just not the most capable of achieving whatever greater purpose or whatever sacrifice that they want from individuals. It is always the wealthiest individuals. It's always the individuals with the greatest social status and the greatest political power that are the most capable of claiming the narrative. We are being the most selfless. We are being the most capable of accessing this greater purpose. That simply means that the people who are the poorest, who suffer the most, the least capable of claiming that narrative of, I did this self-sacrifice to achieve something pretty good. We told you at the end of this day, we have a closer, more genuine connection to God and we have more individuals that are part of that community that share your emotions and your suffering. That is why we clearly take this.

    I'm going to break this debate down into two very intuitive themes. The first is internally, does it make people happier or sadder? And the second is, how does it change their actions to make other people happier or sadder? So first on happiness, right? Our claim is that it's way, way in my search, conceive of yourself as an insignificant speck of dust floating in a beautiful universe that you feel like you have one life and have to prove yourself and do God proud in order to make it good. And the first instance that we give you is that in times of great difficulty, being told that religion is all about the self is incredibly harmful. I think she has a reasonable line here, which is to characterize self-centered religion as being very, very validating and self-selecting and that you can self-select into like the kinds of narratives that you prefer. And no one can tell you what to do because you're independent, right? I think that the main response to this is that unfortunately this debate doesn't happen in a vacuum. Fundamentally, human beings are social animals and religion itself is also highly communal. What that means is that connection to God exists on a scale and there are comparisons to one another. Perhaps because there are Bible study discussion groups in which you talk about what you've personally done to make yourself closer to God and note crucially like independent of religion, human beings are competitive. We want to be out for performing each other. We want the approval of our priests. And for those reasons, you have the constant pressure to perform. But second of all, it's also just the case that you can't non-align and lionize people who have done very, very well, which means that you are enshrining certain traits, certain traits, such as being a very faithful and obedient and passive wife, for example, or if you're a self-sacrificing man, you can make his country proud. All of these things tend to favor power, favor the establishment and make you much worse off and form the minorities O.G. wants to talk about. However, I do think that there is a claim on CG potentially that is better, which is that, you know, in times of difficulty, you can benefit from individual connections to God because you gain support and the strength that you need because you feel inspired and that you can push this difficulty and gain more from it. I think that even though that sounds good, it's inherently actually extremely harmful. The reason for this is because it makes your happiness and your comfort on being able to get something out of it or on feeling strong and on feeling able to push through these things. And the problem with that is twofold. The first is you often can't access the kind of underdog stories or the arcs that are nice and justifiable. And the problem is when you're going through really, really difficult shit, you form expectations of what you want to achieve. You think, OK, God has cost me a God. I've lost my wife. I've lost my children. But that's a test from God. It's because I was a bad man in these ways and I can still get them back if I do ABCD other things. And the reason for this is because people aren't perfect machines. Oftentimes, we interpret religious narratives through the context of our own lives, which is what this debate does. And that means our own hopes and preferences get imposed onto the way religion behaves. So we assume that that's sort of things that God wants. But ultimately, these are outside of our control. Economic circumstances are obviously independent of us. There are some random chances of fate that mean that we could lose certain things, like we could just be wrong. All of these things, life goes very, very badly for most people and experience a good deal of suffering. But the second main thing here is that I also think the feeling of strength and having God with you is really inaccessible. And I think that this also beats Uji's claim on bringing more people into religion. Because I actually think being like, I can benefit from a personal connection to God is really, really, really difficult when you're not actually raised to be religious as a child, because you're told like there is this God out there and then you can benefit from a connection. Like, what is this connection? I don't feel it. I don't see it. Whereas on the comparative, I actually think that self-rejecting religions are way easier to access. The reason for this is, what do most of these religions look like in the status quo? Oftentimes, they center around nature. They look at underlying rules about the world. And the reason for this is because the natural foil to being centered around the self is giving up the self and breathing and being, trying to let your consciousness fade into the universe. And that's pretty beneficial for two reasons. The first thing is, I think that the world around us is quite beautiful. And it is possible to just walk outside the door and see a tree that is beautiful and green and gain happiness from that. But the second main reason is crucially, it's especially effective in times of pain and difficulty. Because literally, like, these religions impose exercises, such as meditation exercises, let your mind expand, letting go of yourself. That literally reduces your anxiety, stress, and depression over time. And I think that that differs from processes of talking about guilt, for example, and confession, which rather reinforces your sense of self and makes your guilt even worse. Crucially, note that when individuality is the crux of the debate, it's very easy for their sides to tell you, you ought to do A, B, C, D things because these are in your own interest. On the other hand, when the sense of self doesn't matter, but crucially, when they're also much, it's also much more difficult for religious leaders to also assert themselves as positions of authority, because they are individual human beings, some people who are fallible, and who really don't mean anything in the grand scheme of things. I think it's significantly easier for us to resist oppression. I think that this is the most important impact in the debate. And the reason for this is because I really think that actions and things are often outside of our control. Like, yes, one person hurting me is quite bad, but people could hurt me or help me for a billion other reasons. Honestly, happiness fundamentally is governed by my own state of mind and how I interpret things as good and as bad. And for those reasons, having this mentality of low stress and being at one with the world is much more important. Before I go any further, I'll take CG.

    > POI: Yeah, so in reality, on both sides, people kind of know that life is quite a lot about luck. Don't you think that these factors will be worked in, in the way in which religion consoles on our side?

    Sadly, I don't think that's the case. The reason for this is because religion is often about being up there being a higher power, right? So like, luck doesn't exist a lot of the time on Gov, because the idea is that like, things happen for a reason. And what has made this happen? Sure, maybe there are similar conceptions of fate on up, but it's the idea that things have happened for a reason, but this has nothing to do with me, because I am but an insignificant ant. And I think that for those reasons, it's much better for like notions of fate to be detached from your sense of self and what's happening around you. Okay, finally, then on actions to others, right? So we told you like to be told that you're matter very, very much intrinsically means that we tell people selfishness is good. And the reason for this is because yes, everyone is important, but people are subjective. I don't have epistemic access to Greg's happiness and harms, and he doesn't have access to mine. So oftentimes, we get overwhelmed by our own pain and suffering, and I'm trying to prove that at all costs. The problem with this is that different people have different levels of power and ability to make themselves better or worse off, which means that if everyone is trying to do what they perceive as the right thing, at the cost of other people, you end up reinforcing social hierarchies and making those with the capacity to do so even more powerful. To be clear, this has driven a lot of harm and suffering in the past, because when people disagree, you need to harm you do the suffering, and you justify that by saying, I'm doing what God wants me to do, or I'm making this person better off. For all those reasons, nature is great, people suck, happy to oppose.

    The real question in this debate is how both these conceptions of religion interact with the individual's fundamental identity and their ability to live the good life. OG's failure in this debate is in explaining why people can never access the narrative of rejecting the self in a way that makes their life better. All their arguments start from the premise of their own lived experience, i.e. these people were born into a life that taught them that the individual experience matters, consequently they convert into a religion that doesn't, and this is what creates the consequent harms because they cannot make their existing beliefs compatible with not caring about the individual. It doesn't explain why someone born into this religion in a society, in a family, in an environment that tries to socialize you out of individualism would have the same harmful experience if they never had a chance to learn about why the value of individualism matters in the first place. I'm gonna fill up this gap by starting from the premise of biology. Humans are biologically wired to be, hardwired to be individualistic, to care about the individual experience. The main reason for this is actually what OO says in the dying minutes of their case, because it is epistemically impossible to access other conceptions of a lived experience. What the next life might look like is not available to you. What heaven looks like is not available to you. All you have is your own lived experience and your own emotions, your own feelings, your own reactions. That's the only thing you can hold on to in this life. This is why Japanese pilots who were socialized in a world and were told that their lives don't matter at all because they have a greater cause, that individual suffering is unimportant and that's why you should be a kamikaze pilot, struggled like fuck to internalize their experience. Their diaries reveal their deep anger and frustration at this system because societies that have attempted to deny this individual experience have always faced an undercurrent of deep emotion, deep guilt, and the inability to conform to what a society is telling you to conform to. I've proven consequently that even if you were born into a world that socializes you into denying the self, it's incredibly hard to live by the specific doctrine that something like Buddhism exposes. The consequent impact is really important, that religions that offer the core tenet of rejecting the self causes cognitive dissonance against the individual experience. You are told that you are wrong for feeling emotions that are otherwise normal to feel. This puts you in a position where you're forced to struggle with this all your life. Any feeling of jealousy, of guilt, of suffering, of deprivation will be incredibly damaging to you when you tie salvation to not feeling things that you're biologically supposed to feel. Why is this the case? First mechanism, fear. If you cannot access heaven because you feel human emotions, that's really bad. It's a really big fucking harm if you care about religion. Because if you do, then the fear of not being good enough to get the reward from that religion is really, really fucking shag. Especially when they tell you that in Buddhism that you'll be reincarnated in a cockroach if you really do feel fear, sadness, if you really do feel happiness, if you really do feel jealousy. That is the kind of fear that you impose onto individuals. And the important distinction here is on our side, maybe like these are things that you can actually do. You can choose to be more empathetic as a person. You can love thy neighbor. You know what you can't do? You can't deny your hunger. You can't deny your suffering. That creates far more fear in the individual that follows this religion insofar as they are unable to actualize the ability to get that salvation in your sight. When we acknowledge your pain, we tell you that here are ways that you can get through this pain. Here are ways that you can get through this suffering because your experience must matter. And that is why we care about helping you and giving you advice as an individual for how to deal with this. Now I know I always want to say that, always want to say, but Dion, surely your Buddhist venerable monks don't give a fuck if you're gay, but Christianity really gives a fuck if you're gay. My main claim here is that the incentive of religious leaders and institutions are symmetric. Because if you're a religious leader, your actual motivation is control, i.e. your power comes from your ability to exert control over the demographic that you are controlling, which could be a majority in a country like Myanmar, for example, like India, etc. This means that you need to be able to have the power to create rules and to assert your authority through rules because as a leader, your ability, your authority comes from that capacity to create rules in the first place. What this means is that mechanisms to assert control over the individual will evolve on either side anyway. They said no, no, no, no, it's about your connection to God. The connection to God tells you or asserts this control. It's not bad, it's just realistically just what your priest or your monk tells you to do as an individual. So insofar as there's always going to be an incentive to control the individual, this harm from OO is entirely symmetric in the debate. Before I move on, sure, OO.

    > POI: On your side, it is also difficult to do the Christian things because, for instance, they often want you to be oppressed because that's beneficial. The difference is that in Buddhism, if you don't do the Buddhist thing, you can't be punished because your actions are not a path to salvation. So you're much less stressed about not being the perfect Buddhist.

    Whoa, your actions are still a part of your salvation. If you feel heavy emotion, you are a person that cannot divorce yourself from like, you know, all of that stuff. The problem here is you cannot access Nirvana. It's literally inbuilt into Buddhist doctrine. I don't know what you're talking about. The key difference, therefore, is in the way that this type of control interacts with people and their human experience. That's what uniquely CG brings to the table. That's why religions are so harmful insofar as they constantly force you to deny yourself and puts you in a position where you're likely to experience lots of active harm, lots of active fear for your inability to do so. The next thing I want to tell you is that the recognition of self encourages you to validate your own feelings and use those feelings as a basis for decision-making. That is the basis of agency, i.e. that telling you that you have agency over your life, how you feel ought to be, how you make decisions is something that uniquely happens only on our side. Why is this important? Because religion is good, as OG claims, but it's not good for everybody. And I think that the ability to leave the religion is also fundamentally important if you so choose, if you realize that religion is no longer good for you. But to the extent that we know that religion is bad for some people, it is our side where people are taught in a way that enables and empowers them to leave if they so wish. Because you tell the individual that your feeling like your feeling of sadness when you're in this religion is valid, i.e. the fact that you should care more about the individual gives you the autonomy or the ability to leave that religion, it empowers you to do so. On their side, what happens is that you're told that if you're sad or you're depressed or you're angry at religion, those feelings don't matter. And it is that kind of denial that makes you more likely to be forced to stay in that religion in the long term. If religion is bad for some people, I think that's a harm that we avoid. Consequently, CG.

    We believe that metric on which you're doing this day to be coercion. But unlike all who say priest will coerce you will explain to you one why your family will coerce you and will crack down on you when you're doing certain and secondly, why greater society in the community will also coerce you based upon this sort of thing. Well, let's just establish what we agree on in this particular case. On their on their side, when they're defending, there's basically material connections to your process to getting into heaven. So there must be some kind of objective things that you must hold a very job, not drinking alcohol, praying five times a day, going to church Sunday will be starting on our site, there could be this sort of thing. This is version one, or but it's not necessarily connected to going into heaven, or there is nothing at all. These are the two versions of this debate will prove to you that on their side, necessarily, the mechanisms are much more toxic and much worse. Let's get into how your parents were most likely religious will think in this sort of case. Notice your parents because they love you, because they have irrational thoughts. And you will necessarily care about your children, but also not children, other people as well. But we think this mainly has impacted terms of children. Notice there is extreme fear in your head, when, how do you say going into heaven is connected with material action and disorders. So you care about your child, for example, going to church, your care about your child wearing hijab, and all these type of things, etc. But notice, this fear is irrational, because you will never have certainty as to how much is the necessary probability or necessary proximity for you to do this in this particular case. So even if your child is technically doing this, you will still think there is more, you will still think there is greater capacity for you to do it in this particular case. Notice that the cost is extremely big in this sort of case, getting into hell is very problematic, very bad thing for you to do in this in this particular case. So what is likely to be the case because you're irrational, and because the cost is big. This is when parents are likely to do bad things towards their child, like for example, to crack down on them in this particular thing, to spy on them, if for example, they're gay, or they're reading things that they're not reading, to take them to church, necessarily in this sort of case to force them to have bad relationships with them in this particular, in this particular, in this particular case, like, for example, also other things, like, for example, banning your Harry Potter book and stealing it away, because it's the devil's thing, and these type of things, right? Why is this so bad, right? Firstly, just on a psychological level, think about this, you're in certain cases, just your parents without hitting you, right? This is a very bad thing towards the child, it's likely to create a big trauma, because how do you say your parents scream that you in this particular case, you have a hard time, etc. But in certain cases, we think that this may lead to the parent beating you up, in this particular case, a direct physical harm. Secondly, it harms the relationships of both sides, both the parent and the child, because the child will remember this abuse that it has gone through, because the child will necessarily feel bad and have, and obviously not be able to love the parent in this particular case, etc. Why on the comparative this does not happen? Because this is a very strong incentive that pushes you in this sort of strong irrationality in this particular case, because the measurement of hell is infinite, right? And the measurement of hell is also infinite in this particular case. So this way, you're pushed towards doing this particular case. On the comparative, yes, maybe some parents will still be bad on our side of the house. But firstly, parents have incentive to be rational towards their child, you know, to not damage their relationship in this particular case, to not go into scandalous things, etc. But secondly, they're less likely to be, how do you say, very problematic about you skipping church on Sunday, or you reading Harry Potter and these particular things, which is not directly tied with a simple behavior in this particular case, in this in this in this sort of thing. So they no longer have to do all these bad things towards their children, because the benefit is not that big in this particular case. Why is this a stronger mechanism than all in here is very particular, all explains that priests will do this in this particular case, but priests do not have infinite coercive capacity from you, right in this particular case, or maybe they do. And sometimes we agree that their mechanism lands them, it's probably going to be obsolete, they'll get in this particular case, but parents have infinite coercive capacity of you, you live with them in this particular case, in many of these cases, these are the strongest authority figure that you have, who have control of your life, who can crack down, go into your room, and see all these sorts of things, who can pressure you to tell you that you are doing bad things, and you are being a wrongful, how do you say, a wrongful, sinful child in this particular case, in this sort of thing. So the extent of which our mechanism coerces people is way stronger than their mechanism coercing people in this sort of case. Not CG also responds to them in this, so their response may deal with all, but does not deal with our mechanism. This is first mechanism in this sort of case. Second mechanism is that it will greatly toxify the community in this sort of case. What do people do when there is, how do you say, a bunch of norms that exist in Dorothy? They like to virtue signal, because they like to feel important in these sorts of cases. So in many of these cases, these people will say, ah, this is the correct way to do, or I went to church this many times, etc. But coercing, they do the opposite. They are also likely to stigmatise behaviour that is not a particular case. They are likely to talk about, ah, Sarah's daughter did not come to church in this particular case. This is very bad in this sort of way. Tom's child does not wear the hijab in this particular case. So because it is toxified, and people will talk about this necessarily, this will lead to, how do you say, worse communitarian behaviours in this sort of case. People will not be able to have a particular trust between each other. So this is impacted two ways. Firstly, any benefit that you're getting from a community, like for example, collective reaction, mental health problems, it is likely to happen when there are things that, how do you say, can create the drama in this particular case. You as average informed voter can feel it, because you lived through the drama. But secondly, and this is very important, is that people feel worse when they're doing this sort of thing, right? People feel harder when, how do you say, it is talked about, people talk behind their backs, it is bad in this sort of case. So it coerces you even more in this particular case. Again, this is a stronger mechanism than priests, because community is far larger and far bigger, and it harms you in this particular case. Before I get into, how do you say, final points of impact, OG.

    > POI: Doesn't the doctrine of rejecting the self empower coercive and abusive parents to tell their kids they matter less and should conform even more?

    Dude, I have no idea why I have to defend reject yourself. I have no idea why I have to defend the most scandalous version of this sort of thing, or basically what the info slide says, which is, just don't care about what happens in the material world right now, right now. You give no structural reason why we have to defend the most scandalous version of this particular case. We give structural reasons as to why this is the case, because you want to work through signal, because you will be uncertain based upon these sorts of things. So this is why we beat you in the comparative in this sort of case, but I will beat you more when I'm getting into this sort of case. Why is this the most important example? Because how do you say happiness or relative experiences, these types of things? I'm not sure what, what does this mean? Honestly, like maybe I'm not a religious person and that's why this is the case, but tangible impacts. Like for example, you're having a bad relationship with your parents. Like for example, you're getting hurt, abuse, and disorder. You're getting gaslighted in all these processes. These are very important, tangible harms, and in many cases are irreversible, right? To work it through this sort of thing to happen. This is why people have experiential problems. This is why people are awkward in many of these cases. This is how it harms your capacity, for example, to get a job, to find a girlfriend, to do all these things and progress in life. One final response towards the CG case. CG basically case, there is a natural push for you to care about individualism and it won't happen on our side. The missing link that does not exist in their case is why do we have to do this in the most stupidest way possible? Like the society will most likely accept individualism anyway in this sort of case. They haven't proved that this must be in the most scandalous way. They have this logical gap and they can't fill it in. Because we have the strongest mechanism of coercion, we put you the biggest impact, CO.

    I want to center this whipped speech around two framing contributions that I think closing government made. I'm going to go into extensions there, but I think these frames do sweep the other three teams in the debate. I'm going for the first framing. First, that there's a recognition of what a lived experience of reject self looks like from young uniquely on our side of the house. And I think this is important because this actually one deals with openings, outframes openings argument on access. Because the reality is most people don't like go and pick religion like you're picking fruits at a market, right? The reality is most of us are born into religion and therefore live with that. So I don't think this access frame is that realistic. What this points out is that the starting point of religion is fundamentally distinct because it's about the values you grew up with from young, but also the processes of indoctrination. And this actually deals with the CEO's claim that they don't have to deal with the worst iteration. One, I don't think it's actually the worst iteration. I think it's a reality of a religion that many people live with, especially in Southeast Asia. But secondly, I also point out that this is about the processes by which you get people from the starting point of being like the biological child that is born to become someone who denies the world around you and genuinely believes in their own temporality, right? These indoctrination processes from young, like meditation, like shaving your head, because in Laos, for example, it's a general social expectation that every child is going to be a monk for one or two years. The ability, the fact that harm to self is part of many religious practices, like running across cold in Singapore. All of these mean that the starting point is fundamentally different. It's that frame that is more realistic than even the optims gave for their own argumentation that makes Dion's arguments really, really important. Because what Dion points out is that all of these indoctrination processes are necessarily insufficient. That is response that never comes up from member of, right? Because the reality is that he gives the example of kamikaze pilots, for example, where even the extraordinary coercive power of Shinto religion was not able to deny the fundamental self. And the reasons for this are given, right? Things like for the lived experience that only you are going to go through. Things like the sensation of pain that is so inherent that you just can't socialize the majority of people out of those particular narratives. Or the fact that at points where your religious faith gets weaker, then those sensations of pain that hurt your ability to exist in the epistemic bubble that is attempted to be created by religion just meet like bricks, and therefore that pain becomes something you suffer and you feel you're unable to deal with. That's why OG in a reasonable op scenario doesn't work. But more than that frame, what we tell you about in Dion is the extreme extent to which this inability to have your internal emotional life, which OG deals with in line-by-line fashion, like one line of fashion, doesn't affect, it isn't reality. First, he tells you that these expectations are biologically impossible for the reasons I've given you. But second, he points out that this is about the means of counseling and the primacy of finding immediate solutions. So this is not just about finding God as OO claims. That's, I think, a very far-reaching thing and not everybody prioritizes. But it's about the starting points by which you engage in that discussion or counseling from your priest. The fact that, for example, priests and parents are likely to start by focusing on your problems versus a world in which you are shamed for feeling these problems in the first place. You are told that you shouldn't feel this because there are better things out there because you should go and look at nature, for example. That starting point of counseling was the distinction that we pointed out made people significantly sadder and significantly harder to wrap their head around what they were told to behave and told to believe on that side of the house that created deep cognitive dissonance, which we thought that for the most vulnerable individuals was critical because these were the individuals who needed to feel like there was somewhere to go to at a point when all seemed lost, at a point when they are depressed, at a point where they don't think they can move on. This is what, like, the ability to have a voice that you can epistemically access rather than feel guilty about was unique to Dion. But secondly, Dion gives you another argument that CEO just doesn't deal with, which is the capacity to leave. And he points out that this requires you to center your own experiences because until you are willing to look at your own experiences for what they are and value them for your feelings at a time, that's the only point at which you can square them against the religious rhetoric you're being told. Ask, am I happy? Is there a better alternative for me? Because that requires you to care about yourself more than the social structures and forces around you. This is important and it deals with always in our meditation and nature because the reality is we already have a fairly inter-religious context, right? So, like, to some extent, if meditation and nature help, people can already solve excess debt. What's important is the primary, the first actor they go to, which is what Dion tells you. But secondly, people can opt out also, right? But that's exclusive on our side to move to meditation and nature, which you can't do on all sides of the house for the reason that Dion gives and no one responds to. Secondly, second big flip, religion is not about theory but about practice. The important thing we pointed out is that religion has to control and will always have structures of control for some reasons. First, that they need money. Secondly, that they tend to need political power and favor in order to have laws that allow them to succeed within and spread themselves within those particular countries. But third also, the reality that synthetization tends to mean that it intersects with local beliefs and local norms that are imposed by politically powerful. Further to that, note that hierarchy is inherent in any religion, especially when non-materialism matters. People who are more non-materialist because their monks, for example, are higher in the hierarchy. I recognize that I'm not over-claiming and saying things are worse on that side, but that's because I think intellectually the debate just doesn't allow for it. But what this proves is that whatever the text is, you are still going to have mechanisms of control. Like how reincarnation links to the idea of interconnectedness to the rest of the world, that therefore means you can become different animals, for example. And the idea that you should be fundamentally be right or wrong in this world, that people tend to accept in this world and in the meta-universe as a whole. This means we accept OO's reality of control, also means that OG is playing margins and only CG actually is able to watch this particular debate. OO.

    > POI: Independent of the most extreme examples like kamikaze pilots and child monks, the pressure is overwhelming for a hundred other reasons. Why would self-rejecting religions punish believers for selfish impulses if you don't actually matter?

    Because what you are told is that ability to be self-rejecting brings you closer to Nirvana and makes you a better person. That is why. You are still debating this by the standards of Abrahamic faiths and what they deem to be right and wrong. That's completely different in a religion that is self-rejecting. CO make two arguments that I think are already dealt with by this, by the way, because they assume that there is less coercive power that then affects parents. So the same rebuttal to OO kills them. But they also say that parents will hurt the child. The reality is things like temporality and Zen are framed as prerequisites to being good, which means that it's parallel because the same incentive structure exists. But also I think suffering is seen as legitimate on that side of the house and part and parcel of what you go through because that physical suffering is meant to detach you from the self. So more suffering is enabled on that side of the house. This is symmetric. Same with the community thing because the biological frame we pointed out deals with them as well. The reality that wanting to feel good about yourself and the fact that your conception of self exists inherently and is to some extent comparative to other people, those are inherent. And because those are inherent, consequently, it is likely that the comparison still exists. It's likely that wanting to be better than your neighbor still exists, which means that those harms still exist. The only real win in this debate, in a world where religion and the structures and social structures of religion will make so many other things symmetric, is the way in which we tell people to feel about themselves. That's what we propose.

    I just want to flag that in order to get this far, and this is 100% not a joke, after we broke 26th, Roman and I turned religious in order to access the necessary power to get this far. So we have a bit of spec knowledge about Protestant Christianism and the benefits that it can bring you by telling you to reject yourself. Firstly, engagement with closing governments, then engagement with Topkap and explaining why coercion is most important in the debate. Firstly, they say being individualistic is a good thing. The first response to this is no shit. This is why a lot of people will still be individualistic. They never explain why religion is the one thing most coercive in society that either determines if people are going to be individualistic or not going to be individualistic. There are many reasons why people would still be individualistic anyways. Their internal pushes as closing government outline narratives of capitalism and of all of these sorts of things that still tell you to be individualistic. What does this then mean? If a large part of society is still individualistic, then the ability to feel bad that you yourself are not, or to critique others, to shame them, and all of these sorts of things, is comparatively lesser because this is not such a wide accepted norm. But notice the problem. On our side, this feeds into the religion and people who are individualistic anyways because of other parts of society, this now compounds on them and they're far more likely to judge you, far more likely to experience this as something they need to do, as a duty they have to ask you, to critique you, because the things they do are necessarily important in this sort of way. So there is obviously for this on their side, there isn't on our side. But secondly, religion is simply less coercive. And here's what I want to flag. If it is true that you want to be individualistic so bad, you always justify to yourself that being individualistic is actually a good thing, that it is moral, or any of these sorts of things. How then would you feel bad if society judges you, if they tell you that they are not okay? Society is far more likely to judge you on our side than on theirs. Why aren't they likely to judge you on our side, which is something that our incentives are symmetrical? Because parents don't want to fuck up their relationship with their child, because people are often far away from you, not close to you from your society, don't have as big of an engagement to you, and simply do not care. The problem of their side is too old. Your mom now is willing to trade off your relationship with you, because she feels that if she does not do it, you will go to hell, which is an infinitely bigger issue. But secondly, people in your society now feel it as an internal duty to do this, to virtue signal, because they feel as if their own experiences are important. I will never explain why comparatively religions would not coerce you. This explains why you would not be reacting this sort of way. Secondly, they say incentive for religion to coerce you is symmetrical. This could be true, but it's response to opening opposition, who say priests and all of these sorts of things will coerce you, because the incentive of your mom is not controlled. Your mom is not an empire builder. Your mom is just a bitch. She does this for irrational reasons. She does this because of irrational beliefs and faith and all of these things. Even if the religion has an incentive to be coercive, the religion cannot make your mom be coercive if your mom doesn't want to, but we prove that your mom will want to. And this is very important to opening opposition. Your mom is far more coercive. She meets you way more often, talks to you way more often, people from your society as well, but also she has the far greater ability to harm you, to fuck up her relationship with you, and to make your life comparatively worse. So we respond to both of the pushes closing government make, and now we can move on to top up. Firstly, why is happiness a bullshit metric outweighing a large part of stuff in the debate? Three things. One, it is uncertain. Some people may like for you to tell them, oh no, you don't matter. Other people may like for you to tell them, yes, you do matter. It highly depends on what your values are, on how you've been raised, on all of these sorts of things. Neither team can claim this as a thing on their side. Also, secondly, there are many other things which lead to unhappiness in your life or potential things that could happen. I'm uncertain as to why this one thing will affect your hormones in this sort of way. But thirdly, and very importantly, it's based on coercion, because if doing something that you like makes you happy, then presumably having the greatest freedom to do what you like makes you the happiest. At the point where we prove that society will judge you less for doing things that you like, for potentially moving away from religion, for being gay, for any of these sorts of things, then you get comparatively more ability to do the things that you're happy at, meaning that this is a comparatively less important metric. Now, on to coercion. What do propositions say about coercion? They say two things. The first is they will still force you to do things because they tell you, you do not matter, therefore you should not be individualistic. Again, guess, but two asymmetries on this. They no longer feel that this is a duty they have, and also they no longer feel that if they do not do this, you will go to hell. So people are substantially less likely to do it. Let's say there is an even-if comparative. Notice that it's much worse to be coerced to do something than to be coerced to do nothing. Because even if you're coerced to do nothing, you say, yeah, maybe you don't get to access the things that make you happy, but at least you don't do things that make you unhappy. You don't do actions that make you sad in this sort of way, like marrying a woman or disgusting things like this that are very gross to me in this sort of way. But also, secondly, closing governments say, at the point where your feelings are valued as very important, you'll be allowed to leave. They say feelings that you may want to leave the religion. I want to give credit, opening opposition parentheses. Your feelings may be considered important, but they are not good feelings in this sort of way. So people still care that you have those feelings, but they will not react positively. They'll not be like, oh yeah, bro, this is very good that you want to leave your religion while it's tough. You'll be like, no, no, no, you think this, you will go to hell. And then all of the coercive things that we talk about kick in, because this is the most important thing. This is the dress rehearsal for heaven in this sort of way. So people are far more likely to force you and to wreck you at a point where you compare to bind to certain things. Before I go on, opening government.

    > POI: We already explained the reason why people don't believe internally indoctrinated worldviews of religious meaning, and that is because it denies them the validation of their suffering. Can you please respond?

    But some people like this. Some people don't like this. Some people would like to think that there's something greater and that their failures do not matter. Other people would be mad that their successes do not matter, because even people have failures, people have successes. Most people would like to think that their successes matter and that their failures do not matter. And then it just comes down to what people think one or the other. You cannot prove that each group is individually greater at the point where we prove more freedom. We prove that more people can enter religion, however they are, or they can engage with religion, however they are, without being pushed away in this sort of way. So if accessibility is what you value, then we get comparatively more accessibility because you're not coerced to exit at a point where you have bad day experiences in this sort of way. Why is this the most important thing? One, note that this wrecks opening government, because opening government say, oh, this will be coerced to do things like harm other people. If people did not have incentive to harm other people, we proved that you would be unable to coerce them in this sort of way, because we proved that A, your interest to coerce them is comparatively lesser, but B, the effect that you have on them and the actions they can take in the real world are comparatively lesser. Also, secondly, note that this weaponizes all, and I'll do one final way with opening opposition scheme. Opening opposition scheme is only about people who are already in religion, but notice, there are kids who grow up and just their parents are religious in this sort of way, right, and they don't get to interact with the priests and the rabbis and all of these things that you coerce them, but we still impact those people, because even if they symmetrically would not be within religion, they are now hated, they have terrible relationships, their relationships fall apart in this sort of way. So even on that basic level, our impact is comparatively greater, we explain why this is most important to us.

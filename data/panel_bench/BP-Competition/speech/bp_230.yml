    In opening government, we believe that no man is an island, and to the extent to which you yourself can do the same things in the world, collectively together, we can achieve greater things in society, build more things together, grow the economy, achieve political accountability, and impact these particular things. On their side of the house, we will necessarily be pushed into individualism and have the problem of collective actionism. I've never been hard to propose this particular issue. What I would prove to you is necessarily on their side of the house, you'll be pushed to individualism for a couple of sub-choices. First, not enough biological pushes you to do these particular things. These are usually things like survival mechanisms. They want you to care about yourself, because you're a couple of thousand years old to do so, I think. So this is why necessarily you experience things like pain and these types of things which pushes you to care about yourself. But second, other structures also prop up on their side of the house, like for example capitalism that pushes you, individual narratives, like for example American dream, but also other narratives. For example, you should look after yourself and care about these particular things. But I don't know. Even if they have some extent of collectivism, this collectivism is usually limited to other things, like for example your family or your close relatives in these particular cases, which actually take away from your community in these particular cases, because when you make them family, this is what happens. And I know what they're going to say here. They're going to say, oh, what if you're elderly? Of course, it was forming a bad community. You can still opt out on our side also. This is extremely crucial nuance. Because this narrative, like any other narrative, is not brainwashing you completely to do this sort of thing. If you experience pain, if you experience all these particular things, you can still opt out. We think that this still means that most of our benefits are marginally increased, but these types of parts do not happen. But what is the bottom line here? This analysis also works on our side of the house. Because these pushes do not change on our side of the house, or still exist to a certain extent, which means that this narrative is not likely to be a super bad coercive narrative in this particular case, and it's more likely to be a good one to do this sort of thing. Now, why everyone? And this is something very important. On both sides of the house, you have communities. But the extent to which resources are pulled from these communities, in terms of money, in terms of time, in terms of people working together, and the extent to which you particularly care and invest in these communities changes. What happens on their side of the house? On their side of the house, you have collective action problem, because you have uncertainties in what types of people are engaged in this community, and what types of people are engaged in this sort of thing. But you also have other reasons that are co-opted into this thing that may be more necessary and not care. Like, for example, you happen to migrate to another country or another town because you want to pursue education in this particular case. Or you may have other interests, because, for instance, there are Zoomers in this particular case, and then you have grown other interests from your family. Here's the problem. The problem is that structurally, some people will always be locked into these communities. This, for example, old people, who have loved people in this particular case, have to live in the neighborhood. This, for example, people who do not have access to education, who do not have access to all these particular things, who have to remain working as a farm worker in this particular case. So this means that if we're able to push other people who live to still care about this sort of thing, to still care about these sort of people, this is an advantage in this sort of case. What are the things they're likely to do? Firstly, they're likely to do things like, for example, be more likely to return to their community, start a business, fix some kind of problems that exist in this particular case, or send money in this particular case, donate, for example, to a school to be built in this sort of case. Or just, you know, call your grandma and see how she is in this sort of case in order to be good, in order to try to make positive impacts to them. Now, this is extremely important, because I'm not necessarily pushing, I'll explain to you a bit more why this is true, but just to be clear, to the extent to which we at least are a little bit winning the utility of these people, but we help people who have no other option and have to rely on their community in this particular case, we try to increase the utility of these sorts of people. But notice also, secondly, you're also to engage not only people external, but also internal in this particular case. Why? Two reasons. First, the narrative or the belief rewards people who are likely to be others and often into this particular case. This is everything from, for example, your neighbor telling you, ah, we did a good job building this fence the other day, or us going to church where collectively we're doing this particular case, but also setting up examples of people who have, how do you say, do good things, John did this, etc. Now, this may not be perfect, but the fact that people virtue signal, the fact that people do this in a good particular way means that you collectively have an interest and an incentive to be pushed in this order. But secondly, narrative also penalizes people who don't do it in this particular case, who are most likely to be shortlisted as bad in this sort of case or not doing their duties for this particular case. Since this community is likely to be very important to you and you're likely to be indoctrinated from this sort of case, so your parents telling you this, your community telling you this particular case, you're likely to care. Again, not to the extent that you're receiving total help, but in aggregate people care more about this particular case. Why is this important? Because people opt out of doing different things they can do. Like, for example, helping each other out. Like, for example, giving each other, how do you say, food in this particular case. And no, this has practical, tangible benefits to people. Because collectively we can do more. We can build more houses. We can start more businesses. We're likely to do. And in many of these cases, these problems in existing communities are because people don't feel taught about these sort of things to begin with. So if you're able to connect people to do this, it's good. But you're not taught it's good. The fact that people engage in this sort of thing, even if it's only building a house of this sort of thing, it's still good for people. People feel nice when they do this sort of thing. When they're able to be rewarded by communicating with their community, or at least they're indoctrinated into believing this particular case, then that means they have better time on our side of the house. Yeah?

    > POI: There's some magical penalty that apparently doesn't stop people from opting out, but it's strong enough to encourage people to do all these different things.

    Yes. Literally, yes. Third argument. Don't coerce us in this particular case. No. It's hard for you to engage in coerce. Because it's something you may not necessarily care about. Like, for example, you could say, oh, it's not my problem. You could be, for example, lazy in this particular case. You could, for example, say it's not that important because they don't have anything to do with us. This changes on our side of the house because necessarily both political actors on this side of the case are necessarily connected to your inner group in this sort of case. Because it's necessarily connected to benefits that are engaged for you. So, when you say mechanisms of society, in fact, this means that people have a higher likelihood to go out and vote, a higher likelihood to join political movements and social movements for specific problems that they have in this particular case. And because politicians see this sort of thing, they're likely to coerce these types of mechanisms and they're likely to coerce this intermarriage of talking about, if they're a part of the community, talking about this particular case. This means that you create whole, how do you say, groups of people or voting groups that exist that are important in democratic process, both in terms of local elections, like, for example, the role of America in the election, but also in terms of national elections in this particular case. Meaning that communities, how do you say, that if they're able to get the push from, for example, them receiving 10% vote, 15% vote, or 1% vote in this particular case, their bargaining power increases, the likelihood of good policies coming to the fore, general political availability of people voting vote also increases in this particular case. The vote online is very simple. Maybe, for a certain extent, some people will be coerced, but collectively, together, as we're able to build all of these routines, as we're able to do all of these routines, means that the curve is bigger on a national level. For all these reasons, propose.

    The first thing I'm going to do is outline a defense of status quo. We still have communities. You still see yourself as an individual related to that community, but the primary source of your identity is your ability to dictate yourself, and your primary obligations are to yourself. This doesn't mean that you never affiliate with your community, but simply it is the way that the community tries to get you to affiliate with them, in the first place, changes. Namely, the obligation should not be from you to the community, but that the community should convince you to stay within that community. This stems from three competitive reasons. The first is simply that there's competition between communities, which means there's a strong incentive for them to try and provide better and better services, or alternatively better and better narratives for you to opt into. But secondly, there's also a fear of dilution and general weakness, which means they have to create awesome incentives for you to help others, and create a strong community. Thirdly, obviously, is that there's no option to disaffiliate enough with any community at all, because the community is simply not good enough for you. The problem with opening government's flippant response to my POI is that these penalties, these obligations, manifest badly, they always have, and they always will. Theoretically, you can opt out, but that is never a realistic choice. For three structural reasons. One, because everybody believes in it, and therefore no one questions it, it is almost impossible to come up with the confidence to speak up and stand a scope. Beyond that, it's impossible or difficult to have visible and invisible examples of other people trying to speak out in the first place, and it's difficult to leave, to move to other places, and to mobilize a notion of support, to give yourself a job, to give yourself community, if community is so important to government, you could never feasibly leave. But secondly, and worst of all, is that once they are, you know, feel the need to instrumentalize you, right, you feel like you're strung along, right? So it's constitutive of your identity, which means it's hard for you to criticize it internally, because you feel it so deeply connected to yourself, and it's hard for you to criticize it for others, because they feel like it's impacted themselves. So realistically speaking, criticism is not an alternative on government bench, but thirdly and finally, that it never occurs to you that the obligation is a problem in the first place, and this blame is displaced onto other groups, other groups of people, other problems in your life, despite the fact that it has and always will be your community. Status quo is a far better site than this alternative. We move to the first argument. People live better, happier, and more fulfilled lives. All people believe they have an obligation to the community on government, but they do not necessarily fit in. We believe that over time, these communities become less and less good for you, less and less fulfilling, and make you less and less happy. First, communities tend to be imposed arbitrarily on you upon birth. Another criticism to the point of opting out is simply that they never explain how you could opt out. You might say in your head that you could opt out, but if you're like an LGBT person, and openly go to the example, and you try to opt out of the, you know, sex community, of the homophobic community, how do you stop heteronormative standards being fed down to you, being forced down your throat? How do you stop your parents at dinner tables saying terrible things to you over and over again? This simply isn't a realistic alternative when you don't have competitive incentives to want to improve that community over time, such as the harms never manifest in the first place. But beyond that, these communities are structurally likely to displace you, because one, they're just millions of ways they will not sue you, or you're released just by accident. And beyond that, over time, the mechanism of social change means that these communities were built and optimized for the past, but as social change in time goes on, you are simply not the person this community is built for. They are built on traditionalist, conservative beliefs that simply do not fit the worldview of today. But secondly, and worst of all, is that values and beliefs within communities become more malleable on opposition bench. The first thing is that simply put, more people question LGBT states, and you criticize whether or not they're good. So maybe in opening government, there are some obligations that they are good, and we can agree, but there are some obligations that are bad. Some of them are a waste of time, some of them need to be corrupted, and some of them are insufficiently accountable. And we observe that when more people question them, we are much able to improve and drastically change these structures as if the actual pooling of resources isn't self-good. I'd like to note that this impact has two immediate outcomes. The first outcome is that the actual services themselves get better, such that the pooling is not done towards harming people, but actually good in the first place. So government never proves that these resources are used for something good, but secondly, and more importantly, is that if they are bad and ineffective, people are never off agency services in the first place, and you get a community that works for no one and for nothing. The second impact is that simply put, people are more receptive to criticism. The opposite of the initial mechanism applied in the initial part of the speech, which is that when you don't feel like it's the only part of your identity, or the main and critical part of your identity, you are more receptive to change within this community, because you don't feel like it's an assault on your identity, and you don't feel like stagnancy is necessary for stability and safety. Which means that you are substantially more likely to allow for change, whether you're a person in power, or a person with the pass of the vote, with the pass of the change, rules of the household, and so on and so forth. But thirdly and finally is that communities themselves have a larger self-obligation to help people, for the structural reasons we provided earlier in the intro. What are the impacts of these points, independent of their destruction of learning space? The first is that simply put, these classes, these cultures, and so on, are preconditions for many of the material needs you have to survive, in order to have food, water, and so on, and a sense of belonging. And so when these things are from the beginning, terrible, or they grow worse over time because they grow less and less into your life, or worse of all, you are unable to go to the one that actually is best for you, you live a much, much worse life, and this is a precondition to any possible benefit that might arise from debate. But secondly and worst of all is that it's worse in communities over time. If government is right that some communities are good, and some are bad, more of the worse ones tend to arise, and this is the good ones tend to stay in place and stay in power. Thirdly and finally is that simply put, people are less happy. They have less time to explore their own preferences. They have less time to explore individual ways, their obligations they might give to themselves, for the basic reason that they feel this is mostly subsumed by the community and hence they are less and less happy. They less know what they can do in that community in the first place, so maybe they might think some basic conditions for happiness, but they never have the sufficient conditions to know themselves and be happy in the first place. Closing.

    > POI: So how would you define your community, and do you think you only have one today?

    Probably when you have the capacity to question that community, you can have people talk together to decide what that community needs in the first place. With a discussion about what the obligations are in the first place, that's where you actually get the benefits. The way I want this argument is quite simple. It's important, one, because this is just the definition of access, right? If it's dated by racism, if it's dated by terrible notions within that community, even if you can pool resources, if it never gets to you, or it doesn't get to you because you don't feel like you have the opportunity to access it, or worst of all because you don't feel like it should be good for you, then there's no guarantee that this pooling of resources has the right distribution. But secondly and more importantly is that the strips are a main benefit. If to me the identity is good, it gets better. If to me the identity is bad, there's no opening opposition to fix it. The second argument, quickly, is that this makes conflict worse and more difficult. Some of the worst conflicts in the human race are spurred on by these communities and their willingness to instrumentalize and dehumanize individuals. The problem is that one, you drastically increase their capacity to mobilize resources, both on a human basis as well as a passive, for people to allow certain things like funding for arms and so on, as well as their capacity to dehumanize others for the basic reasons that they feel like they deserve forced obligation to, but beyond the second is that these resources become zero sum to come between communities. It's much harder for you to see an intersectionality between communities, I lost my time by the way, it's much harder for you to see the differences or the similarities between these communities because you are so focused on this one community subduing your entire life. So maybe they spend more and more time in that one community, but the problem is that many communities get weaker and weaker over time as they are drawn on by the larger ones that cause hate crimes, that cause destruction, that cause war. Maybe open government is why some communities are good, but they never allow them to be. That's why we oppose.

    Don't you really care about all of us? And that's okay. It's okay because, you see, you have your own communities, you have your own things to care about in your particular life. The problem is that, if me and Roman also didn't care about Bulgaria and debate it, well, it wouldn't be maybe that worse, it would be significantly worse to the extent in which we are in the unique position to do some good for these particular perspectives. You see, life is a lottery of birth. You don't get where you're chosen to be born. So let the individuals who have the most capacity and the privilege to actually enact some change in these communities make their own choice, not to be obliged to those particular cases. They remove the only chance for these communities to thrive in the first place. This is what we stand for. A, opening, government. A couple of things like this. I think a lot of the frame of Roman explains to you why on the counterbalance we do not have the tipping point for active particular change. So you might still do some things for your grandma, but you are unlikely to take the bigger chances and bigger risks. So this means like you taking that corporate job in the big city versus you establishing an NGO or a business in your particular small communities. You are not choosing to go under the pressures of actually engaging in politics where you can just stay in your house and make money and donate some money to your community in this particular case. This particular narrative is the tipping point for these things. We also believe you are going to do it in a smart way, meaning that you are part of this community, but you are also part, and this is direct responses now to opening opposition. You are still like an actual human being. You still engage in globalism. You still have access to internet. You still have access to knowledge and all these things, but you also have the ability to recognize particular wrongdoings and problematic things that your community is particularly doing, which means that you are in a unique position to call these particular things out. We want individuals especially in privileged positions to continue calling out these particular things in order for them to enact actual change inside the community, and if they make the choice not to do it, nobody else will be able to, which means all the other people who are not in that privileged position, being the LGBT person in that religious community, being the person who is in poverty and cannot escape to the big city and things like that, there's nobody else to help these people. So gradually things are going to get worse for them, and gradually we will have no active change on our side of the house. I think you have to help them, and on principle I don't believe that you have that particular obligation exactly because you are in your unique position. You are probably in many of the spaces, one of the few that speaks their language, one of the few that understands the particular context in historical sense, in political sense, in any other sense that bad things do. Maybe some of the cases you take particular privilege because you are smarter than many of the other individuals in this particular place. You are the only one because of your burden, because of the inherent nature of society to make sure that you do something for these people, and you cannot be permanently proud to support this. More responses, I think, in the most extreme cases. We don't see this obligation as going as far as actually coming to die for your country and things like that. And I also would say, we don't even say that this obligation goes as far as you have to pay taxes to this community, things like that, because no compensation is set. What's more important, however, is that you still have the capacity to choose how you engage with this particular narrative based on your particular degree and consequences, but the main goal is that you do something. You do something that you believe you can help this community, and you think about this, and you go to the gate, and you make the right choices in a particular case. We still care about you. You're still going to put yourself in the worst position ever, but this is why you're going to engage in this narrative in a productive way in many of the particular cases. Look, I also, yeah. So, in happiness. I think happiness, again, is for us out of the house. First of all, you can uniquely achieve happiness from outside of the house through this narrative which is given to you, because you believe that you derive your happiness from the fact that you're helping your community. Why is it we pick on ourselves and say, essentially, flipping? You know, like nowadays Americans, we like flipping. I don't know. The thing is, we like happiness on the outside of the house because you have direct access to a particular meaning of your life. On the outside of the house, we don't know. Is it because you're religious? Is it because you eat something like that? Things like that. It's far more important to derive happiness from helping other people, and it makes you make the hard choices in the first place, which is extremely important. I think, finally, of conflict, I think incentives to create conflict are symmetrical. Things such as states, deep propaganda, nationalism, and things like that are probably going to happen on both sides of the house. I think the extent in which you care about your community, at least on our side of the house, the rebuilding process is much bigger, because you don't escape this country which is basically ravaged, which has no alternatives. And you don't leave the people behind that are being there, that have no other options, especially if you are not a privileged person. Before I continue, opening.

    > POI: So this relies on the premise that the most excluded are in the community in the first place, and the problem is that we constantly look for reasons to exclude them because we constantly force other ages on them that they can't be.

    No. You are picking and choosing particular situations and particular communities. We talk about much more situations on our particular side of the house. Many people are not LGBT, and they gain LGBT responses on this particular basis. You don't have to defend. You're dying for this particular situation. I explained to you why we have the particular obligation. I think finally in this round, what matters the most is that we increase the capacity for these communities to do better, and we uniquely do it only for us. It means that when that person decides to go back in some other way, especially when individuals are different, some are very egotistical, others are not so egotistical, all these spectrum will influence them throughout the whole, especially those from privileged backgrounds, because those from privileged backgrounds are likely to see the full picture in some of these scenarios and are likely to feel the pain. Now, when they are actively part of their community, they feel it as an obligation, they learn more, they are more activated, and it trickles down for all of your society in terms of your ability to basically bridge the empathy gap to other communities and understand that other people need help in these particular situations. For the one last fucking time, I'm so happy to propose.

    In the world of opposition, unity is a shackle that alienates you from your very sense of self, discourages you from discovering your own preferences, and emboldens the worst forms of theory. The first thing I want to do is explain why individuals feel deeply alienated and unhappy in their world. Because the extent of their material is to say that you can derive happiness from helping your community. Problem, they never explain why people have the capacity to help their community. And I would suggest that in any given society, very few people will have the resources to give back to their parents. Especially those in the most vulnerable and marginalized situations, where they need, as a precondition, to be able to help to prioritize themselves to the extent. And this is where we fit the material. The vast majority of people fail their obligations far more often than they are able to meet them, even in the smallest ways. Most people become busy with their job, can't call their grandma, can't call their parents, can't vote in elections because there are other things that preoccupy them by matter of necessity. The difference is that on that side of the house, the unhappiness and intense feeling of failure you feel as a result of everyone saying that you have this obligation intensifies. And this is where their case falls apart, right? Because they can't assume there is a magic pill that leads you to believe that things were conditioning. The mechanisms of social conditioning remain largely the same. This is things like legal punishments. It's in their world where communities become more harsh, become more dogmatic, and become more willing to impose strict punishments on people who fail to meet their obligations. So when they talk about the elderly who cannot contribute, who cannot work a job, these are the people that society comes to resent on their side, these are the people who are more unhappy. Look at how marginal the entirety of the opposition states is, secondly, to all of the material we give you from David as to why alienation results. First, you aren't given the time and capacity to find your preferences. Yes, you believe you have an obligation to your community, but doesn't mean your preferences are automatically aligned with what the community says your preferences should be. Individuals will still want to find and want to pursue their passions. The problems in your world, they're constantly discouraged and are never given the avenues to explore their passions. You aren't given the things like access to education, given the things like access to extracurriculars, because in their world these are seen as distractions rather than useful things that individuals ought to pursue. Second, because even when you find your passions, you're constantly forced to make sacrifices, constantly, never tolerated and never given the option to voice out your own preferences. But third, because even if you are able to engage in your passions to some extent, you feel constantly burdened, because you feel like the opportunity cost of not helping your community is always what you're sacrificing. Take the example of an Asian child who thinks constantly that he has to help his family, he has to help his parents. Even when he does find genuine joy in playing video games, every breaking moment of that means of happiness is played by the thought that he isn't doing enough for his community, that he is failing his obligation. And this is where the analysis today is crucial, because we explain why the expectations of communities get worse in this world, why the obligations become harder and harder to meet as a result of people not being able to opt out and communities having no competition mechanism that facilitates them. Even if you get better collective action problems, people are just unhappier and that is worse. Secondly, let's engage with OG and explain why this narrative makes communities themselves work. Because the entirety of OG's substantive case is that communitarianism motivates people to engage in collective action, to build social obligations and do things like vote elections. The problem with this is at no point do they explain why these are all, but all exclusive. The first thing I'd point out is that self-interest can motivate each of these impacts as well. It is possible, in fact, to go to a line of self-interest and come to collective solutions. You want to vote for outcomes that benefit you. You love your parents as an individual, which is why you vote for them. You recognize gains for society and economy writ large still raise your own quality of life, which is why you work towards them. And here's the kicker. It's in their world where individuals are less likely to consider what outcome is best for society, because they don't view themselves as having that role or that responsibility. They believe that the community is the only actor that can dictate what's best, which is why they never seek to imagine these in the first place. You are bound to what leaders tell you is the best outcome, which is why you're meant to actually get worse outcomes from them. But secondly, I'd point out, for many of their own impacts to work, you need a level of individuality. You need to have the motivation to climb the social ladder before you can give back to your parents. You need to have the economic capacity to do things like that. It ain't so far as individuals are less likely to take that step, less likely to move away, less likely to pursue a job in a different city. Because they feel like they are failing that obligation, you won't get any of the benefits you yourselves clamor for. But thirdly, I'd point out, and here's where we flip it, I'd point out that solutions to collective action problems are both more likely to be sought out by the people and better done when communities actually feel like they could benefit the individuals in question. Because government assumes that the mechanisms by which communities decide what outcomes they work towards remain the same. But that can't be the case, because many of the mechanisms we rely on in status quo, like the vote, are premised on the recognition that individuals are superior to other communities. The fact that they're premised on the idea that the communities don't know everything. Accountability requires a level of independent thought and requires a meaningful opt-out, which is why we cannot get their impact. I'll take closing if you have a point.

    > POI: Do you view debate as your community as well as the community you were born into?

    Okay, so this is where I want to flip the point of intersectionality. Communities become less tolerant of people having more than one community in opposition for three reasons. First, because every obligation and their ability to feel every obligation is seen as zero-sum. You are either fulfilling your obligation to the debate community, or you are fulfilling it to your nationality in the instance as where it used to be. Second, because individuals themselves are less exposed and less likely to seek out other communities in the first place. Why would my parents, in a world where they think my only role is to be, I'm sorry, but to my community, allow me to engage in debating, allow me to spend the holidays in Madrid rather than spend time with them? I'm sorry, dad. But thirdly, we're more forced to make trade-offs to the most immediate community, because that is the one with the most power. I want to note here, communities themselves striving is not the alchemy that can win opposition to debate, insofar as they don't explain why those communities are good. We explain why our net communities get far, far worse, which is why our material and our responses put us ahead. Thirdly, let's talk about conflict, because this argument is independently debate-winning and has an absolutely minimal response, which is just to say that nations have an incentive to propagate conflict and nationalism on either side. Clearly, the difference is a few things. First, it manifests in how willing people are to disengage from that conflict and disengage from the terrible things the states are willing to do to them. It manifests in how willing you are to question, how willing you are to form counter-identities and counter-communities, say that you are a revolutionary, secede from your state, declare yourself as an independent actor, rather than continue to be forced to exist in the same community you were born into. But secondly, it manifests in how willing you are to dehumanize other people, when you see them as fundamentally different from you, because you don't consider yourself an individual, you consider yourself a part of your community. That is when you are far worse, that is where you are most in a nation, for those reasons, oppose.

    There is a problem on top hat so far. OG, good guys, want to talk about good communities getting better. OO want to talk about some bad communities getting worse and alienating people and explain why communities would be something that would lead to less need to serve individuals. In our extension, we are going to show how people in the counterfactual world are likely to perceive community and what communities they are likely to identify with, meaning we will set up a question on which is more impactful. We will show why communities still have an interest to compete for you and why people are likely to give back to all of us rather than just an individual ethnic community that they might share. One piece of extensive rebuttal then the extension. I want to point out something from the manual because I feel like OO should congruent. In this house prefers a world not just there is no retro causality. The motion gives us fiat to assume that people just believe that they have an obligation to their community. This is why the retro causality which they can't argue anyway about the community would have to enforce it and push to everything it enforced in the manual even if you don't agree with it is something that we just can't claim per the debate. Secondly, I also want to remind that a word in the motion is all individuals, which just says to politicians and leaders that decide policies in the first place. We think by all this logic, it's likely that communities in any case are incentivized or even if not incentivized, believe that they should aid their own people. Let's chat about what actually changes in the debate. Quick for a preposition. OO concedes in leader opposition that on both sides of the debate, people have community affiliation in addition to their self-interest. They use it to mitigate OG, by saying you still have caring for your community, which is obviously correct. Note, however, that without characterizing which are the incidents in which today we don't prioritize our communities, this also mitigates their own impact in the debate quite significantly because it means that while the communitarian prioritization of my own people, et cetera, is quite symmetric, what are the instances in which we think today people prioritize themselves over their community? A, when they think that the personal benefit to them is larger than the one they would get from the community. So today people also have a self-interested reason to care about the community because the community serves them. But when instances where they think that they could get more than what they would get from the community directly, say if I could make a crime and get away with it, are instances in which I intended to prioritize myself. Two crucial reasons why it is solved under our side. A, because self-identity that is grounded in community means that hurting the community is equivalent to hurting myself. If I base my identity on my community as well, it also means that I'm less likely to hurt it. But secondly, it means that there is no need to get caught. Note, throughout most of history, we have issue of actually enforcing laws. Half of all murderers never see the day in prison, not to mention crimes which are much harder to prove such as rape. Simply because it's really hard to deter people, it's really hard to catch them in incidents and people have optimism as to believe that they won't get caught. Under our side, they don't need to get caught. Their own guilt, their own conscience will always haunt them. Thirdly, when people don't know or rationalize to themselves that what they are doing isn't hurting their community, because they can't read minds, so they assume that their actions are just going to benefit others even when they are actively harming them. Because, say, they are being bigoted in a sense where they don't know that a friend of them might also be in the poor part of the community because they are in the closet. Under our side, there is a much stronger push to actually proactively think of what are the implications of the actions you are doing on the other. Fourthly, when people think that people around them are bad and don't deserve that you actually care for them or prioritize them. We think that under our side, you know that not just you, but everyone around you also believes in that. Meaning that you know that they care for you and know that they are going to serve you in the future. This means that you are less likely to have stigmas against people in the first place and think that they are going to care for you as well, meaning that they deserve good treatment out of you. Who are you likely to see as your community? We think several crucial things. A. People have multiple communities. When I came up to the stage, people shouted Tel Aviv, as much as people shouted Bulgaria for Sofia. However, we also shouted for them ESL because this is yet another wider community that they have as well. Presumably, they also have some non-debater communities, but these are obviously less important. We think that this means that people learn from a very young age to extend their community farther than just the one they are born in. Know how this already engages OO because this community still needs to compete for you and that your identity isn't locked to just one community. If, indeed, as OO said, I am gay and the community doesn't accept me for it for some reason, in addition to the community I was born into, I also have the gay community, which is great. Secondly, we think that people also see in the way that it manifests that it's not just about that. Because I'm supposed to prioritize the community over myself, and as everyone in the debate could see, this is set to the large community, not just my own family. It's not about proximity. It's not about my immediate circle of closest. It's about much wider than that. Thirdly, we also view community in this world based on what the community does for me. Note the wording in the info sign. I feel obligated to the community, meaning that it directly ties to what the community has done for me. This is what I'm more likely to feel affiliated with, rather than just the color of their skin or what name they have. This is what I'm likely to see as community. Opening.

    > POI: The big analytical gap here is that the community gets to define what meaning of harm and obligation is in the first place.

    Thank you. Thank you. Gotcha. Here's the thing. A, literally everything I said is likely to be implemented by the community itself. The community teaches me to prioritize the community, not just myself and my own family. So I prefer from these circles of proximity that are not the most proximate to me. The fact that I learned that the reason I should care is because of obligation. Okay. Moving on then. What are the impacts of this? Firstly, we think it means that in this world, people have significantly less stigma and racism. Note, all, all sense. On both sides there is communitarianism. The difference is, when today I associate with my nationality or with my race, I am less likely to apply to things that are relevant to my obligations to them, and more likely to associate with things that are about my favorite identity, meaning that it's less likely to be about wider circles. Secondly, we also comment people will do less bad things, less crime in the first place, proving less active harm, not just more donations. Thirdly, it also means that people will treat each other better personally because they extend the community to each individual around them, which doesn't have to go through specific societal systems that need to evolve.

    I think the truth of this round is that opening opposition has been highly worse case, and opening government and closing government have been highly best cases. It's probably unfair to imagine that communities are going to punish you massively for the types of things you decide to do in either world. So the contribution from closing opposition, and I know this might be a surprise at this point in the round, so it's no excuse for wanting to feel high, is that we are going to claim, A, since we've been co-opted by the American crowd, that selfishness is good, and B, we're going to deal with the claim of, we're going to deal with the best case of opening government and closing government and explain why it's the case that these communities act even out of love in ways that restrict you and prevent you from accessing choice. We think that communities have subtle pressures to manipulate you and mean that you can't make decisions that are in your best interest. Opening government and closing government in this round loudly praise how these communities and how many communities they're actually a part of, and yet still criticize the status quo where this is possible. I'll do a couple of things to that. First, refutation, then a constructive argument about why these obligations are negative, even when they come from a good place. Accepting the highest possible verb in this round and explain why it's still awful in the world of government. I just want to respond quickly to closing government, then. The first thing they say is that you can free me in these communities, and that is a good thing. One, even if we accept this to be true, this hurts massively. It is very, very difficult to turn your back on a community. But the reason why they say that this is so easy for them to be able to turn their back on the community is that they don't feel this very, very overwhelming sense of obligation that we think this world creates. So it is possible to turn away, but in their world, it is a decision that is fundamentally traumatizing and limits you. But more than that, they say that there are infinite ways to define a community. The obvious is that in the status quo, you are given the capacity to define and choose which communities you are actually a part of. Because there are competing groups, and there are groups that you can consider yourself a part of at any given point. You can decide to be a part of one or the other, because they aren't seen as trade-offs. They aren't seen as mutually exclusive. So, with that out of the way, extension. Your obligation comes from a sense of collective love. Your parents aren't going to be the ones that shame you endlessly every single night. It's not going to be the case that your friends consider you evil. I don't think this is fair. Instead, let's characterize this as the average community. Places where there is a sense of love, places where people do in fact care about you, and where they want you to succeed, and they want to support you. Why is it the case that even within the confines of these communities, you are still fundamentally excluded? Accessing the benefits of opening opposition, but doing so in a world that actually exists. One, there are cultural ways in which this is expressed. So, for example, watching movies where characters always give back to their families, or always give back to their most close communities. So, fundamentally speaking then, culturally, this is a restrictive choice. And even if we think that this choice serves some sort of utile, instrumental benefit, we think that we should care at any level, because we are not utility robots. We are people that derive satisfaction from making choices that benefit ourselves and our things that actually realize our own interests. So, to the extent that this is manipulated in their world, even socially and even subtly, this is still something that is principally regrettable. Second, I think that this creates, no thanks, a strong sense of responsibility. The reason is that it is overwhelming. You perceive it in different ways, right? Love in their world is a very different thing. Whereas now I believe my family, in our side, is a group that loves me unconditionally. In their world, that is fundamentally tied to the sexist condition. I doubt whether or not that love is something that is real. I feel like I need to give back, because maybe that love runs out when I don't. So, to that extent, even if they're not telling me that, to the extent that this narrative is fundamentally perverting society, it is something that still overrides my decision-making. Third, I think it's just the types of decision-making that make me become accustomed to. So, it's things like making decisions that benefit your siblings at your expense. These are very, very small things, but they are things that condition you to prioritize others at your own expense. But fourthly and finally, I think that alternatives and doing other things is just consistently portrayed by the media and other groups around you as just being something that is selfish. It is something that is counter to the interests of your group. It's not acting as a good human. So, if it's the case that you act selfish in our world, why is selfishness something that we actually think is just acceptable and is actually breathable? One, I think that having autonomy to redefine your communities and the communities you are a part of is something that is uniquely accessible on our site. So, you can decide which communities benefit you and which ones are holding you back, which is what OG and CG see so hell-bent on accessing. And this is really, really good for social mobility, because you can decide what community is actually restricting you. You can decide if your conservative parents are actually holding you back, and therefore you can move to that community, and you don't feel the sense of backlash or internalized guilt that their site imposes. Second, even if this isn't true, people can still specialize, and specialization is something that just makes people more effective. You can define communities that you are most beneficial in. You can define yourself in relation to your professional career, for example, or in terms of your romantic life. These are things that allow people to do what they are best at, and these are the areas that you derive the greatest sense of satisfaction from, because they are fundamentally rewarding you on a constant level. Third, it is moderated at some level by opposing narratives. Before I explain this, I'll take OG.

    > POI: Would you leave a drowning baby aside so you don't gain your mutual collectivism?

    This is so random, right? Like, it's not about the drowning baby. The claim is that like there are a set of reasons why suddenly you're pressured, and selfishness is something that is good, but not that this means you're gonna leave the freaking drowning baby. Why are we doing this whole best-case-worst-case thing? Let's just deal with what happens in 99% of scenarios. Hopefully it works. It is moderated by opposing narratives. Again, being terrible. God forbid. Okay. You moderate because there are other narratives that have to exist in society. Things like people telling you that you ought to care for your family that already exist in this vast book. Things like give back to community. These are all norm-stasis, religious-stasis in society at large, so that neutralizes the extent to which any given narrative can completely permeate your sense of existence. But furthermore, I think it's just growing to spite your community, because if you're aware of what you lost out on, you feel like you didn't get to make decisions, you feel like you were limited in the type of life that you offered in the first place. And that trades off with giving back at the highest level. Because then there's the sign, if it's true what CG says, that you abandoned your community at some point, or that you grow to dislike them at some level, that trades off with giving back, because you feel like that community actually failed you, or you grow to resent them over time. I think leading these communities, then, is a precondition to doing good, because making those choices is what gives you a sense of meaning. Why is this harmful? A few sets of impacts. One, even in the communities that actually treat you nicely, you preclude access to multiple sets of identity. This activates OO's material on the conference as well. You can define yourself by your job, you can define yourself by your romantic interests. But second, I didn't principally think this was flawed. We said that we probably believe that our obligations extend beyond these communities as well. For example, to the world. I've heard of processes like colonialism, for example. But thirdly, there is a general sense of isolation that sets in in their world. It's that you just end up spending more time with your family and these groups that are close to you, at the expense of others. So even in the best case, even when you're loved, even when you're connected to security, these subtle pressures restrict you in ways that are awful. And so the best case for government is awful, we oppose.

    I'm going to talk about two things in this speech. I'm going to talk about the quality of life of individuals, and I'm going to talk about conflict of behavior towards other communities. But before that, a few answers to closing opposition. I think that what closing opposition misses, and opening opposition misses as a whole, is that when people view themselves as part of a community, an identity, an obligation towards that community, it's not just the individual that has an obligation towards the community. It is the community of other individuals strong within that community that feel an obligation and identify with other individuals within that community as well. That means that all of their analysis of the likely reaction of this community to my desire for change and how excited to be within the community is false, because if other individuals in the community see my pain, if they identify with it, if they feel like my pain and my inattention to them is there, if not bad feelings, then they're less likely to force that upon me and be more open to adapting in order to make me accept it. This means that closing opposition's framing on the fact that it is more traumatizing to leave the community on my side, I think is actually false at the end of the day. Because when Hadar gives you analysis on how communities view themselves and the circles of communities and how people relate to each other, this proves that on our side, because the rest of the community feels like it is obligated to you as well, that is when they're more likely to adapt and more likely to accept you branching out and doing all of those things. But moreover, I think today communities act that way because of the selfishness of individuals and because of the knowledge that other individuals will prioritize themselves over the community, so leaving the community is likely to harm them. By explaining to you the exact situation in which today people prioritize themselves over the community, and that's exactly what we're avoiding on the other side, that is where she shows you that communities are likely to react differently. Even if OG said similar words, our explanation of the impact and how this impacts how communities relate to the individuals within the community is unique to our side and significantly more engaging with the claims coming out of opposition than our opening government. But second, just in case we're closing opposition, we're trying to do it, we're one on the principle where you're allowed to be selfish, when I don't think they proved that an additional analysis would be too late. Here's what I think is not true. We think that there is a balance. You're allowed to prioritize yourself as long as the harm you're causing to other people doesn't overweigh that. I think what Hadar shows you by showing you where people prioritize themselves today and why that's likely to change, shows that that's exactly where the balance sits, because people prioritize themselves in cases like crime, in cases like corruption, in cases where you are prioritizing yourself significantly to that extent, and that's why it goes over the balance. That's why I think closing opposition are now out of this debate. Let's talk about the quality of life of individuals. What do opening government want? Opening government wants people to push more to do for their community, things like getting material needs and having a sense of meaning from helping the community. What do they don't care getting help from? Opening opposition tells you that today, individuals who want to help their community in order to help themselves also have an incentive to do many of these things. So I have an incentive, just selfishly, to build schools and to donate and to do all of those things. What is Hadar's unique contribution to this question and why it's important? We don't show you the additional benefits that people might have by getting one more school or something like that. We show you that today, the specific places where people prioritize themselves over the community are places which cause active harm to other people. These are places where people commit crimes against other people within the community in order to profit from themselves. This is where the tradeoff between individualism and the tradeoff between community happens, where the actions that you're taking aren't actions that benefit yourself and the community, but rather actions that only benefit yourself. These things that we're showing you on our side, we get significantly less of this active harm. Why do we think that less of this active harm is the important thing? It's because we think that less of this active harm is what leads to more people within the community having access to the good things that people have an incentive to do anyways today. Even if people have an incentive to build schools today, when I'm only prioritizing myself at the expense of other people, not everyone has access to it. Or if I know that people are going to commit crimes instead of going to class or just ruin the building that I'm donating, I'm less likely to do it in the first place. That means we show you both an expansion of the impacts that opening up and save themselves because people aren't only doing things to benefit themselves but for the rest of the community, but also show you why it's logically higher because if people know that other people within their community are going to harm them, if other people in the community are going to take away or mitigate or minimize the benefits that I am sacrificing for, I am less likely to do them in the first place. Where does this put us in relation to opening opposition? Opening opposition says that communities are bad and arbitrary and will get worse because they're not acceptant of change. What do we show you? We show you why their explanation of the counterfactual, of being more tolerant, is symmetric. Because there is still competition, that's what I thought I showed you, but also their claim on the narrative debate is actually less likely because of what I told you about the sex of obligation and identity going both ways. That means that both the competitive incentive means that I don't want to be punitive. I don't want to make people feel bad within my community. I want to make them feel good within my community so that they don't go to another one. That is their mechanism and it's symmetric and exists on both sides. But also the fact that the other individuals within the community also feel bad when I take punitive punishment towards others. They also feel bad when I make other people feel bad about having feelings because they also know that there is something that happens to me, that is why other individuals are less likely to do that, limiting their case and making it more likely on our side. Before I continue, I'll take closing.

    > POI: Religions tells you should give back to your society more or less policies like welfare. Why is this itself can be very worth access to the selfishness the only sentiment as equipped?

    There are some communities today which also say that you should give back to your community. We agree with that. What we're saying is that the specific cases in which the individual prioritizes themselves have been significantly less on our side leading to a significantly more positive outcome. That means that you have actually more choice and communities get more acceptance. And in addition, people have more access to the needs that they need within their community, meaning that they're less likely to want to opt out in the first place because the community is tolerant towards that. What is the impact on conflict and behavior towards other communities? We think that OG don't touch on this at all. But opening opposition push and say, when communities prioritize themselves over others, that's exactly when you become racist and conflicts break out. But we think that they don't engage with the fact that the origin for conflict isn't just I care more about my community, it's when I actively have to fight for resources over other communities and can't share, that's when I have an incentive to tell other communities that they're bad and can't have access. When we show you that more people have access, that communities get better overall, that we have less harm, we both show you that there's less stigma towards other communities, less legitimizing the actions against them, but also less fighting for resources that will cause the outbreak of that conflict in the first place. For those reasons, please propose.

    Our extension is very simple. People know themselves the best, and they're the ones who must live with themselves into the future. You only have one life, and you should make the most out of it. And people are better at making themselves happy than at guessing the preferences of other people and trying to make them happy indirectly. Even in the best-case scenario, people's desires and personalities do not disappear under the weight of community. Over time, resentment builds and simmers and starts support that they want to buy. What is the response we get from closing government? That, well, actually, we don't really want to restrict individuality to that extent. We only want to prevent you from causing harm. One, that is not what you said in the extension, giving everything towards a self-obligation to something imposed, for example, through culture, through conditional love, through the reasons that media changes and condemns you for making selfish choices, even if they don't cause harm. But second of all, crucially, notice that their metric for harm is based on the general definition of humanity. It's based on the idea that regardless of who experiences it, the human suffering is bad. However, it becomes justified to commit these immoral acts when you perceive some human beings as more important than others. Obviously, there are still going to be some of these harmful acts on our side. However, it's going to be significantly less than on theirs or your village pet harm for your community. Why does this speak OO? The reason for this is because we want to discuss love. Sure, sometimes you are trapped. You are coerced. You have nowhere else to go. But more often, you love your family and those around you, and they love you, and they want the best for you. They're the people who raise you, or the soft, lovely, cordial feelings you have towards the debate committee or whatever still exist. The problem, though, with their case, then, is that the subset of populations that they talk about, by their own survival mechanism, that those that suffer and have difficulty retaining people grow smaller and die over time, then become less and less prevalent, and Isaac's case is the one that makes up the vast majority of instances. Before we go any further, OG.

    > POI: You didn't conceive all your switch in better commissions for the most border of life was in those with the biggest class to make the biggest changes in this community even though which one that doesn't get the handicap.

    Do not fear. I remember your case. I will get one to it later. Okay. So then, why do we beat OG? They give us two contributions. The first one, they POI it two times, and it's how they're trying to outplay OO and take the one. They tell us that there's a plurality of communities, and you can opt into them. First panel, notice how defensive this is, because at best, it just mitigates the harms of quarantine. But second of all, it's also just not true. And again, Isaac gives you the reasons why your visits are not much more targeted than OO does. But second of all, they tell us how people behave better. Two responses to this. The first thing is, if this is true, then it's also the case that their claims on people, it's also extremely, extremely limited, because their first claim on community being flexible and you can opt in and out means that if a community tries to change a behavior to a larger extent, so for example, someone is predisposed to not having empathy for others and committing harm, then that person simply leaves that community. So it mitigates the insolvency to a larger extent. But second of all, in their best case scenario, this benefit doesn't prove. It's actually cons of the cause that we're not willing to solve. Because they tell us that deterrence is insufficient, that it's not enough for social rules to look at us and go, well, actually, this is bad, it's unacceptable, these are harms you should not commit. They tell us that you need to think constantly about what your community wants and perceive yourself as a subset of that greater whole. That takes away your autonomy and your agency as a human being, because you cannot think about what you want or what's best for you, and you constantly must second guess and check your preferences. This is a violation of basic human rights, and we reject this. Let's use a basic way in here. At best, their mechanism for change takes them in a small subset of cases. It's unclear what their margin is relative to the other consequences that exist on harmful actions. On the other hand, the restrictions they impose on human beings exist in every single case on scale we have here. Finally, then, on OG, their major claim is that, well, it's better for you to support other people, and that makes people better. So the first way we should beat them is we're going to compare supporting other people with being able to support yourself and make yourself as good as possible. Three reasons why individualism is better. The first thing is, I want to flip the structural reasons that we would give up top for why individualism and incentives for that already exist. In that exact same way, through our corresponding sense of polity already, you feel a desire to help others because of evolutionary desires, and humans are social animals, etc, etc. I'm here today to say this is very, very simple. The fundamental premise, then, is that family will help you on either side of that house. That is to say that the most basic and fundamental conditions that they're trying to win off are out of respect. This is far more marginal content. But the second thing is, even within your own community, this is a really bad way of helping each other. Very simply because it's a fundamentally regressive mechanism, right? Because communities are also spread out over demographics and social community groups. Those who are up top have a greater ability to enhance one another as well, and make themselves better off, whereas those at the bottom have less of an ability to do so, just because they're far greater concerns on time, on energy, on emotional labor, and so on and so forth. That means that they exert their inequality. On the other hand, I, okay, so this is kind of strange, but I will shout out to the EA girls, and say there are also strong trends in the status quo that mean that people gift each other, and they give in ways that are far more effective of the inequalities that exist in society. The dramatic title here, what the OG gives us, is perfect, because it's based on your obligation as an individual, and this is fundamentally morally right, as opposed to your obligation to any community, because they have helped you. So for those reasons, large numbers of people will give, and even if it's not large, there's enough extremely well-competing for our community to foundations such as, I don't know, fucking the Laurier Foundation, very close to each other than I do, to make things better. But the final result I have is that communities also sometimes make sacrifice, it is also harmful for communities to make sacrifices sometimes, and to hurt each other, just because the benefits of this house is indirect and impulsive at best. Basically, communities don't know what you want. For example, your parents might believe that the best way to support you is to give money to you to help you go to medical school, even at the cost of their own happiness. However, you don't want to go to medical school, so the fruits of that labour are extremely small. However, it also imposes upon your obligations, feelings of regret, and I think that because they have given to you, I must go to medical school. While you'll say yes, again, this has to some extent already across the house. However, it gets significantly worse on theirs, because obligations extend beyond just your immediate family, like your community, your sociality, your school, whatever, all of these different factors. For those reasons, we are propose for that OO, and we beat OG on impact and through direct responses. We're happy to close.

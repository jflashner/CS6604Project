    For a long time, the suppression of the self has been the foremost concern of humanity and their ability to be happy. We think religions that emphasize the self as something inalienable and something that ought to be preserved is something that will make people on the whole happier and exhibit more of the characteristics of centering the self are better than those that exhibit less of the characteristics that center the self and reject the self. What are these characteristics we think are very good? One, recognizing that there is a diversity of human experience that emphasizes all these experiences are valuable and essential. The soul, the feather-spun person beneath the flinch is the source of your divinity and that makes you unique and valuable. Two, the self and the existence of that self is positive and life is positive. That is, the existence of your individual experiences as unique is good and not temporary or unhappy. And number three is that the primacy of the self and the choices of the self we know today are good and are actual versus some greater obligation to an afterlife or to a God that requires self-sacrifice or the sublimation into a greater whole. These are the characteristics we think are good for the debate and more importantly what will be debated on. So number one, agency. First, I will do the counterfactual which is I will prove on our side we have much more of a diversity of experience and a respect for the agency of people. On our side, the conception of the self where the difference of human experience is special and valued is much more likely to lead to the acceptance of individuals who belong to sexual minorities excluded within the church for women who have the rights restrained within religion simply for the mistake of being born a woman. We think that the ability to equalize experience is much more likely to cause significantly greater acceptance for these individuals for three reasons. One, their differences are now highlighted as similarly a path to divinity and as a connection to God rather than one that is unholy and strays away from the pack. Two, it is more likely that people accept differences rather than curse it as a means of betraying the community, the leader and God, which is more likely an op because you are told that you have to reject yourself for some greater purpose and hence being more individual leads the community away from group solace. And three is that they are also more likely to find individuality as a way to interpret and practice religion on gov. So they see that individuality as something to cherish and as something that can be meaningful in allowing them to better experience their relationship with God. So this is personally preferable. It is important because getting more than just community acceptance, they are also likely to get personal acceptance of themselves and who they are, which is incredibly difficult and incredibly important internal harm to make sure that people are comfortable in their own skin and in their own lives. This is incredibly important since whatever benefits of religion op argues is incredibly inaccessible, if not actively dangerous to the people who need it the most. What does it look like on opposition bench? We think opposition leads to key repressions of agency. We think religion can typically be a highly oppressive structure a lot of the time and balance and the greater structure of it can be difficult. If the source of value on our side is unique human experience, as we say, it is more likely that religion values doctrines that maximize the choice of people because they are primary individuals rather than the imposition of authority to introduce order. On their side, one, differences are seen as a source of unhappiness and authority will take it upon themselves to do what is best for people to suppress this. Two, absent the ability to connect God from the self, it is not necessarily that you get it from meditating, but op will likely seek it out from other higher powers, which means that they are substantially more vulnerable to politicization, they are substantially more vulnerable to a single individual controlling the reins and using it for their own gain. So in instances where religion is coercive, you get three harms on op. One, certain minority groups on the color of their skin are more willing to be suppressed or experience suppression more because you view their individuality as an affront to God and something that should be expunged. Two, you defer a lot of authority rather than democratization on the ground, which makes it vulnerable to cooptation and politicization. This means that these religions are more likely to be used in the aid of authoritarian governments, they're more likely to be used to suppress people in the name of power. And number three is that you all experience internal suppression, which is super vicious and suffering. That some people will be individual and unique no matter what, but they feel that this part of themselves is something that is broken, something that is flawed because it makes them want to cherish themselves, but this goes against every belief that they have. They are born with preferences, they will be very different somehow. Everyone has something that makes them different from someone else. That means every person in the world that can experience some level of suffering and some level of despair because they can ever truly reject the part of themselves that they are born with and have no control over. Why should you weigh this argument massively? One, because it talks about vulnerable groups who have very little opportunity to fight back, who are most likely to put in positions of deep disprivilege and need the solace the most, but are at the same time removed from the solace. Number two, it has the potential to throw societies in upheaval and conflict because religions and op are most likely to descend into violence and suffering because they are vulnerable to a large leader who's comfortable in suppressing the individuality of people, leading to large-scale conflict and politicization. And number three is that this tyranny over the self cannot ever be mitigated because it is coming from you, something an external body does not have the similar amount of harm. You yourself are the one that experienced causing this massive physical harm and mental harm unto yourself and will go with you for the rest of your life. This is why we think a world on opposition is a world not worth defending. Second argument though, we think it is also easier to convince communities to come together and help the most vulnerable, help the poorest in the world. Our counterfactual being centered on the self doesn't mean that op is centered on other people. Indeed, we actually reject that and say our side makes people better for other individuals. Three reasons why. Number one, if human suffering is unimportant and is temporary, it is much easier to justify deprioritizing the wellbeing of other individuals in the name of justifying their spiritual happiness, despite the fact that they are suffering on the ground. Two, especially when your individual life is an illusion that causes unhappiness and your struggles are unimportant, it is easy to sideline their issues by calling it a necessary part of human life. So not just saying that it doesn't matter, but that it's obligatory that they suffer. And three, assuming the desire to do good was the same on both sides, which we categorically deny from the first two premises, the manner in which you do good is also worse, right? There are more likely to support interventions that impose on people. So, two, kitchens that alleviate some suffering now, but keep people locked barely above subsistence instead of consulting people for what they actually need, like building schools, building roads, building hospitals, based on the real lived experiences. I'll give the fourth mech after I take the away from CO.

    > POI: The action of the self means that you believe that differences are incidental. When you center the self, it means you value those differences being something that is fundamentally part of your human experience.

    And yet, since these differences are incidental, they must be removed. They're clearly unimportant to people. They're clearly unimportant to you and can be removed. So even if they are incidental, that makes things even worse, as opposed to something that should be expunged from people. Fourth mechanism. It's easier to relate to others because even if experiences are unique, you can find some broad themes and acknowledge that they have a self that is just as dignified as yours. Whereas if on the up, people are all the same and there's no underneath the person, right? There's no nothing underneath the soul that gives them that uniqueness, then it is not sufficient to see them as worthy of dignity. Hence, why is this really, really important? Number one, religion is the largest charity in the world and the largest outpouring of aid that humanity has really ever seen. So we're just like losing out on a gigantic amount of aid, gigantic amount of resources to uplift people out of poverty, particularly because of the structural reasons saying that the suffering is indeed necessary and important to keep in place. Number two, they're also most likely to target areas of poverty where no one goes that have very few people to support them because they still see these people as worthy of uplifting in order to unlock their choices and make individuality available to them. But number three, I also wanna point out that it's not just physical spirituality, but physical health, but also spiritual health that allows people to experience solace and happiness in ways that they could not, especially in particularly oppressive places or places where they feel the most amount of suffering. At the end of this speech, unambiguously, categorically, the center of the self is precisely why government is the center of this debate. Affirm.

    We believe that the framing and characterization of how this narrative works in OG is a bit convenient. The first thing I'd like to posit is, this narrative is independent of other narratives that operate in the world. For example, there are lots of other narratives that operate, that promote a sense of self. Things like capitalism, things like other reasons, like basic biological needs, where you want to earn more money to live a better life. All of this exists devoid of religious influence. What is the reason for this influence? Because this is dependent on drive power, i.e. maximizing your ability to control resources, maximizing the output that a society generates in order to create lived experiences for those who've captured power early. This debate then happens in a world in which these natural drives for self-preservation and importance already exist, but counterbalances that with religion that says maybe this narrative is not important. So the first thing I'd like to posit is, having multiple narratives is in and of itself a win. The first reason for this is because different people end up having different degrees of success in life by virtue of a plethora of reasons that I'll get to in my second extension. But I think this is intuitive enough. Some people are born rich, some people win worlds, some people don't end up in semis. What the point of this is, is that when you get individualized success, you can still get happiness by subscribing to particular amounts of narratives that exist in the world that tell you that individualized success is important versus some people who don't end up winning the capitalistic zero-sum game and fall at the bottom, can subscribe to religion and therefore get contentment out of this. If you look at the world empirically, the richer you are in a lot of cases means you're more educated and you've opted out of religion to begin with. That's a good thing because that allows you to subscribe to that form of happiness. So the first and most fundamental attack to OG is, this is a narrative that challenges existing narratives, that maximizes accessibility of narratives to a greater number of people, and therefore distributes the quality of life more equally. Let's say this is not true. The rest of this case will assume that this is not true, even though this is good enough to beat their case and why the alternative narrative is good enough to begin with. The biggest case they say is, we need to maximize agency by accepting women and minorities within, but understanding differences of self. Before that, I'll take CG.

    > POI: Well, it is true that narratives like capitalism are also individualistic. The kinds of behaviors that they privilege from individuals and the kinds of individuals that they hold up as icons are different and that has different consequences for the way we view ourselves.

    And the argument is it's beneficial to have different narratives that different people can subscribe to. It's unclear what all subscription from all people is likely to be homogenous. The first response to acceptance of different people, which is differences of self. The first thing I'd like to point out is, it is unclear why the way in which this acceptance happened is structurally explained in OG. I.e the way you ascribe, what your interpretation of yourself is, is often basis religious leaders or the way in which this religion is interpreted. The first thing I'd like to posit is, the definition of self can be prescribed. I.e you are born a man, this is yourself, and this is what the rest of your life should be. It is unclear why you are trying to change yourself. Yourself is important. So the interpretation of that can stop the most important minorities that they're trying to protect. The second is you are often blamed for the choices that contradict religion because you see it as an individualized choice that these people actively choose to make. Principles like homosexuality is bad in religion came much before these complex doctrines of self materialized in the world. So things like you choosing to be gay is seen as an attack on religion that is more likely to be flipped against you because yourself and your choices matter. The comparative is, when none of these experiences matter, you're more likely to just be like, yeah, let them fuck another guy, who cares? Because it doesn't impact the way in which they should be deemed as moral entities. But secondly, you also disempower religion to the same extent where you say that their definition of yourself matters less. The entire human experience matters less. So the ability for these religious leaders to influence you also comparatively reduces. If anything, we accept the minorities more on our side. First positive material, escapism. We believe the vast majority of the world is predetermined. There are lots of reasons for this. Number one, lottery of birth. You don't choose what kind of family you're born into. Number two, IQ. Number three, your interactions, who you interact with and your set of legal experiences often determine what your free will is in the future. Number four, even if all of this is not true, just pure randomness of the molecular atoms in your brain that influence what your ultimate choice or life will be. What this means is you often don't end up choosing the ultimate experiences that you go through in life. Why is this particularly important? Number one, this is premised on the fact that you are prioritizing all of these experiences on Gov. At a point in time when certain people are privileged and they think this privilege needs to be maximized because their set of experiences matters, there is less of an incentive to give up these kinds of privileges because you realize your individualized experiences also matter and therefore you need to maximize your connection with God. So you do things like donate a million dollars to building a mosque because that was the capacity you were born with rather than thinking it's just less important to begin with. The second is the worst case of this is a lot of people are oppressed and end up suffering. The best case of this is you just undergo randomness. So some people end up with good experiences. Some people end up with bad experiences. There are two major harms that operate out of this. Number one, you blame yourself for not doing enough to be religious. I.e. you often don't interpret the structural barriers when you think about yourself all day. We see the same problem with capitalism. It's a very simple parallel. When you think from an individualized perspective at all times, you always try to compare the next day to the previous and try to see incremental improvement at different points in time. So when you fail because of structural barriers that are beyond your control, you blame yourself for that failure rather than blaming external actors. Number two, you also are further harmed when religious actors exploit this and tell you that no matter how much you do, the uncertainty of what this relationship with God is like, which is important in God's world, means they can coerce you into continuously doing more and more every time. So the more you pray, the more they say, donate more. And you are further put into a cycle of exploitation where what you are as a self and an experience does not matter or there is no end point. Ultimately, what this means is even when you do things, like try to discover yourself, things like anti-religious choices, you just feel worse because that choice is something you subscribe into. Ultimately, this means all of these people live in existential crises because they didn't choose where they ended up in. And therefore, they also suffer by virtue of that experience. And therefore, they feel bad that the narrative they're fed to all societies is the fact that this experience matters. The comparative is on our side, very simple. Number one, you just ignore that these experiences matter. So even if you don't get the best outcomes in life, which happens through randomness, you're at least content about it. And therefore, the net unhappiness, which is prominent across the world is reduced. The second is you also prevent exploitation by religious groups on the most vulnerable. That I think is important. Lastly, and more trivially on social change. I think it's also important for majorities to realize that they themselves and their wealth capture does not matter. Okay, sorry, I didn't know my time was up. But the point is, it's just better for people to experience life, not through randomness, but and be unhappy through it, but through contentment. And we're very glad to oppose.

    I first wonder about this other narratives exist argument, because this only one stance will take over Number one, I can name equally as many narratives that focus on self-sacrifice for the greater good of a community, nationalism, family, so many other things that make this balance of whatever incredibly useless. But secondly, even if you didn't think that was the case, I think especially where people have religions as their primary motivator for the ways in which they determine their behaviors and the way in which they view life, are where people are far most likely to be vulnerable. I think the question from opening opposition is how do we make it so that we don't have to I think the question from opening opposition is, they don't really explain the degree to which coercion occurs, whereas I think David was far more structural in explaining why A, if you value every single individual human experience, therefore the source of knowledge of religious freedom and happiness ought be the individual rather than some greater structure around you and imposition of the choices of that structure, because they are not a greater source of moral authority in so far as what makes you holy is your direct connection to God rather than needing some kind of mediator in the middle. But secondly is, in so far as that increase the amount of choices that you have, for people that are especially vulnerable, this has two benefits. Number one is if religion is the main motivator and influence in your life, it makes it much less likely that these figures are going to be more oppressive. Either you don't feel like they actively impose ideas upon you, or even when they do, you don't necessarily have to subscribe to them in so far as you also believe that your own struggles, beliefs and ways in which you connect to God are equally as valuable as whatever the recommendations ought be. So for the most vulnerable individuals, that's where they're more coercive. But secondly is, and this responds to their point that things like homophobia existed before these kinds of set of the self things, which this motion is not a retrospective, this could easily equally apply. But secondly is that even if homophobia was an aspect of that religion, again, it is more likely that even if the community around you believes in these kinds of things, that you feel like your own personal experiences and your own source of moral authority is sufficient in order to say that it is wrong, that your direct connection to God and your sexuality is key and core part of that, rather than saying they are correct and I must accept and internalize the degree of homophobia that exists within my religion. But thirdly, I think what they do not mention is that all these other narratives do not answer an existential question. I.e. capitalism might tell you to work hard to stay alive, but it will not tell you why you are alive. And I think that is the unique nuance of religion because it explains what is the reason for your purpose? Why are you here? Why are you on this earth? And I think the problem with opening opposition is they ignore the degree to which personal solace matters so much to the various people that they cater to, such that absent all the agency, political, donation arguments that exist within this debate, the most certain benefit here is that it is much easier for people to connect to a life in which they believe their own personal experiences that they go through every day whereas Sajid says, we are in such a deep personal reflection of why you are on this earth and maybe God put you here for a reason, et cetera, as opposed to thinking that every single day of your life on this earth is unimportant and unnecessary. And the important thing to note here about the comparative opposition is that oftentimes what they do is they connect this to some greater spiritual purpose, like an afterlife or a God that is either incredibly impersonal, especially when your own personal experiences and humanity is ignored or so far in the future that you will never get to experience it. That's incredibly important because for a lot of individuals, when their life isn't so good, when their material experiences of the people around them, as Sajid says, are not very good, oftentimes religion is the only thing that's convenient in purpose. Firstly is even in bad experiences, oftentimes it is religion that gives a sense that you were not left behind, that there's purpose to everything that you go through. Like when you have a family member that is sick and gets better, you feel that maybe God had intervened in that manner because God values your own individual and personal experiences as well as the fact you can interpret and reflect on those experiences in a manner that makes your struggles and connections divine, which is much more likely you feel that your religion has an everyday purpose in your life, rather than some arbitrary and abstract purpose in all honesty, as yet to be defined when opening up as a struggle. So that's incredibly important precisely because I think it is the most accessible benefit in this debate, absent of all the other environmental factors that might exist as a consequence. But the second thing to note here is, I think David argues quite concretely, why is it we get people to rally together in such that we think human experience is valuable, that human struggle is like, and we should remove human struggle and ensure that they are recognized as important and as valuable, and that you can connect to other people, you're more likely to get donations, but also reflect the kinds of agency that they experience. The important thing about this is that in so far as opening up this case relies on an incredibly worst case scenario of you fail, you don't do well, you don't have a good material life. Not only do we expand the number of people who no longer fall under that category, because more and more of them are being taken out of poverty and given the means to do so. And so far, I think it reflects their choice on what they actually need in their life. But moreover, I think this is the most material benefit we can accrue in this debate, versus all the other arguments coming from opening opposition, I don't think are nearly as important. I'll take the POI from CO.

    > POI: Yeah, a higher purpose is often couched in the material world through obvious virtues and valuable things, such as giving to charity or constantly engaging in charitable action. We probably get more material benefit to those in need on our side of the house.

    So my question is, why do you think that solving human struggle is valuable if it's unimportant and humanity is unhappy anyway? If not, rather than trying to strive for some greater other purpose, then again, as yet to be outlined in opposition bench, and notably, you need to believe that the diversity of human experience is a valuable thing to begin with in order to attain that kind of benefit. So it's unclear to me why that benefit falls on your side of the house. Last thing I wanna do is like respond to the PR coming from opposing opposition, because they say that differences, instead of being valued and special, are instead incidental. There are a couple of reasons why that is worse. Firstly, these differences will oftentimes lead to worse quality of lives for people when they are discriminated on the basis of these differences. In so far as we believe that these are incidental, unimportant, it is much easier to attribute the fact that it is maybe their own fault because these differences don't matter, or the fact that we're ignoring a lot of the very real and genuine struggles that they have had in order to ensure that they get little to no reparation in the future. That's important for a couple of reasons. Firstly, both in terms of how we react to these differences, it is much easier to make up for and ensure a greater amount of accommodation. In so far as you recognize that these differences exist, that they matter, and they do not try to obfuscate everything in some vague sense of equality, and therefore, if everything is all right. But secondly, is it particularly for these individuals, when they recognize that part of the divine process is some kind of struggle, that these struggles are important and valued experiences, rather than things that everybody goes through equally, that even if they have lived harder lives, they still are going to be seen as equally as other individuals, that instead is celebrated as a divine and holy purpose in their path to salvation, is much better and gives more likely comfort and solace to these individuals. So to the degree to which we're able to both materially provide for them, and at the same time, give them some sense of comfort, it is when you recognize that these differences exist, that diversity matters, not when you say these differences are incidental and not meaningful in whatsoever form. I'm very proud to propose.

    The biggest assumption on opening government is that because you have a religion that centers on the self, somehow magically all unique experiences are going to individualize to the extent to which religion becomes all inclusive and caters to everyone. We tell you that this is A, a massive assumption and B, massively convenient. I'll explain structurally why. Because what you need to realize is this obviously operates in a world that exists today, which is to say that vast majority of religions came about in either before Christ or after Christ in the sixth centuries, first century and along those timelines. In those timelines, it was necessary for religion to do two things. Number one, establish social order to a set of principles that were then endemic to their time. And number two, it was also important in order for a lot of people to capture power and rule over particular groups of people and so on and so forth. Which means that the hierarchical structure that religion has and generally operates under is important in both sides of the world structurally because of the way in which religion operates. Now, the question is, how is it then relevant for the center of the self experiences and so on and so forth? In center of the self experiences, you have choices, experiences, struggles and connections to God from an individual perspective that are important, right? But nobody necessarily is essentially born an expert of religion, which means that generally speaking, when it comes to like seeking religious help, seeking religious advice, you still go to people for religious, so priests, mullahs and so on and so forth, who are on top of religious hierarchies and so on and so forth. But what is unique to this particular experience of choices and so on and so forth is that you value these choices to utmost importance using religion as the litmus paper to judge all of these choices. What do I essentially mean by this? If you are then an individual who wants to choose to be an alternative sexuality, you ask yourself, would religion allow this? And the answer to that is no, religion wouldn't allow this because religion subscribes something else. In order to establish your connection to God, you need to be of a particular sexuality for that connection to be established. For opening government's argument to come into play here, they have to advocate for the non-existence of all forms of religious scriptures that came about in the world in one way or the other, which we think is quite impossible in this particular instance. What is then the comparative on our side? The comparative on our side is individual choices do not matter as much. What does this mean? This means that your spiritual connection to God generally and the fact that you have an afterlife and so on and so forth are things that matter more generally. Why is this that important in those particular cases? Because your ability to judge someone else for their individual choices goes down the point at which you do not think individual choices matter as much as you think it is. But yes, under our side, yes, you still think it is possibly a sin and it is something that is an aberration from religion. Yes, but you do not put as much importance to this as much as you do in government's world. Why is this then bad in terms of impacts? Because it opens a pathway for exploitation to a large extent, not just from rulers, but priests and so on and so forth. How does this happen? This happens in two ways uniquely. Number one, because priests and so on and so forth, because hierarchies emerge naturally within the human existence anyways, they also prioritize their own individual connection to God. So I, as a priest in a particular community, also prioritize the fact that I need to maximize my relationship with God to the fullest extent. In order to do that, what I will do is make sure that my congregation, my followers are also following religion to the particular letter in that particular instance, rather than in a comparative under our world where you reject the self and your own connection to God is not as important, but rather a general wellbeing of individuals is more important because life now matters less more generally. In those particular instances, you open up a doorway of exploitation. So exploitation that opening government claims under their side actually happens worse under their side because then they can say, ah, but given that all of your individual choices matter and all of these things matter so much, you need to follow my word and you need to follow my word in a way such that it is important for, like it is important for you to then maximize your happiness under religion. And that's quite important in this particular case, right? Because then you allow... But secondly, generally speaking, your ability and the way in which you see others changes, and that is particularly important. Why do I say this? If individual choices are important, individual agency is important and so on and so forth, you see as a Christian, I'm making Christian choices. And that is very important because my individual connection to God is very, very important. In those cases, you judge anyone who is not making those Christian choices because these are of utmost priority to you. You believe that making Christian choices in this world is the most important thing for you and for everyone within your congregation, which opens up a pathway for, A, otherization of different individuals who are like generally minority religions, but B, otherization of individuals, even within your family. So if you think your son or daughter is probably becoming someone of alternative sexuality, then you start suppressing them and that's horrible. Before I move on, I'll take one from closing opening.

    > POI: So even if hierarchy is bad in the abstract sense, what you've yet to prove is that given that hierarchies do exist in either world, why if I'm doing what the hierarchy tells me and that makes me a happier person, why that's an intrinsically bad thing?

    Okay, that's an intrinsically bad thing mostly because we have accepted generally within this debate that religion is, it generally gives you certain horrible ideas because of the way in which structural religions have come about. So for example, vast majority of major religions in the world, 6 to 6.5 billion people, maybe even more than that exist within religions that came before 6th century and before, which means that that is quite horrible in general in this particular instance. That is why it's important for you to reject the self and the hierarchical teachings coming in are not as important, which means that in a way, because you're rejecting the self and because you're rejecting that this life is something that is way too important, you're able to then abstractly find happiness in other sources. And this is where Sajid's argument becomes very important. In a capitalistic world where you don't have a lot of control over a lot of things, and this is not just restricted to material wealth, this is also restricted to things like religiosity. Vast majority of us, if we look at it from a religious lens, even religious people commit a lot of acts of sin throughout their lives. In those circumstances, if they then come to assess their life as to, oh, what about my individual connection to God? You end up in a self-deprecating state where because you did not have enough money, you did not have enough time to pray. Because you did not have enough money, you did not have enough ability to contribute to religious charities, religious beliefs, and so on and so forth. That's why you go into a self-deprecation mode because people who have power always have captured more important places by the end of things like contributions, by the end of things like capturing positions of priesthood and so on and so forth. In those circumstances, a rejection of self uniquely allows you to then tell yourself that, look, I have made sins in my life. I may not have been as rich or even middle-class to a certain extent, but because this life is not as important, I can prioritize something else and I can get happiness from something else. This is uniquely important in this particular instance because things like nationalism and other collectivistic identities do not uniquely allow you to access happiness from these things. Because even things like nationalism and so on and so forth are tied to some form of collective material goals, such as economic growth and stuff like that. This is a unique form of identity that allows you to abstract yourself, put yourself away from the material life that you have, and then get happiness from outside. And that happiness is the true form of happiness that you can get. Under our world, you have less religious exploitation, and under our world, you have happier individuals. Incredibly proud to oppose.

    I'll be damned if we lose to that case from opening opposition. Our position on closing government is quite simple. Despair is worse than suffering every single time. And people need to believe that they can change their lives regardless of whether or not that is the case in order for them to attain happiness. There are other factors in this debate. Of course there are. There are other people who can impact your life. There are other economic forces that can impact your life. Of course there are. But we think that the most important thing in this debate is how you as a person who's facing suffering, who's facing tough odds, views yourself in relation to others and how you view your life. That is the single greatest margin of change we can make for billions of people all around the world because all of the change that we want is happening far too slow. And in the meantime, people need a reason to be alive. There are several premises to our extension. The first premise is many people suffer right now. Fortunately, OO gives you all the mechs for this. So I'm going to skip it. But the reasoning is quite simple. Yes, deterministically, there are reasons why people are given a poor lot in life. There are systems like capitalism that include and exploit certain groups. There are immaterial differences that nonetheless get privileged for historically contingent reasons. All of that means that millions or billions of people will continue to suffer. They will continue to starve, not have clean water, not have clean sanitation. They will watch their children die from disease and nothing is going to change, at least not fast enough. Second premise of the extension then. Why do we afford people some level of agency and why is that agency good? There are four mechanisms for this argument. And what we're going to do is be as comparative, specific and exclusive as possible, engaging with the best form of OO's analysis on all of these claims. But briefly, what do we do on our side? We tell you that even if your condition is bad, your individual contribution to life still has matters. And I think an example of this is Hinduism, a religion that has karma, which says that what you put into this world will come back to you in some form. And if it doesn't come back to you in the form of other people treating you well on this earth, it will come back to you in the form of a future life where you can reincarnate and have a better life in the future. Simultaneously, it tells you that if you're in a bad situation right now, it's not your fault because that's the consequences of a past life that you could not meaningfully control. But what matters is whether you benchmark yourself from where you are and make a difference in this life, that's what's going to matter. I'll mechanize why this is what religion will look like, but I think that is the most prominent example. Four mechanisms. The first one is you give people an internal locus of control. That is people now have a sense of control over their life and religion tells you that you can do X and that can improve your lot in life or in heaven. Whereas on their side, you necessarily have to be agnostic to what religion tells you to do on this earth. And so you don't have that same sense of purpose and belief that change is possible or that change is good. So yes, they're going to say this could be bad because religion is going to give you bad things to do, right? That maybe you're not going to do the things that are the most helpful for you, or maybe you're not actually going to be able to achieve those things. Our claim on this point is quite simple. Just the belief that doing something has the possibility to help is enough. In the same way that standing up and smiling can improve your mental health, regardless of whether or not your back condition gets any better, or you have to go back to working an eight hour job, in that very same way, just taking the first step puts you in a mental frame that you are in control of the situation and our brains are programmed to shut down when we believe that we are helpless and unable to control our situation. This is why we are concerned about learned helplessness in babies who don't get to engage or move around because they feel like they don't have control of their circumstances. And even at the age of one or two, it can have a dramatic impact on these people's brains. The same is true for human individuals. Second constructive claim. This changes your frame of reference. It tells you to benchmark versus where you are and where everyone else is, or instead of doing that, it tells you to benchmark from where you are. Here's where we engage with OO who says there are other individualistic narratives. We completely agree. And that is the reason why we need to differentiate here. Their example is capitalism. Capitalism does tell you to be individualistic, but in very different ways. It is a meritocratic system that judges you based on your contribution to the economy. And so how much it caters to you and gives you a fulfilling narrative is directly proportional to how much economic weight you bring to the table. But per OO's analysis, those things are contingent. They are arbitrary, and not everybody gets to win under systems like capitalism. So when you don't become wealthy, when you don't attain your economic goals, you tell yourself I've failed in life and you compare yourself to other people. And given that narratives like capitalism exists, it's very hard for OO to convince you that your suffering is not something you should be worried about because capitalism is still going to be telling you that you should be worried about it. Religion is different in two key respects. The first one is it's a community-oriented system. So it specifically relies on what you bring to a community, which typically is less based on immutable characteristics and that you can contribute to a community in many different types of ways that depend on your specific characteristics. So you can be a good friend to people. You can be charitable. If you're wealthy, you might donate, but if you're poor, you might just spend time taking care of the children of your friends or your family members. All of these are meaningful ways in which you can contribute. The second religion is different is that it directly has the goal of proselytizing and getting as broad a reach as possible. And so it tries to be favorable to the poor since that is the majority of people. That is the reason why Catholicism says it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God and emphasizes the good works of the poor, even though the law in life that they were given is so much worse. This also then can directly engage with the hierarchy claims that we get from OO. A, if there is hierarchy, this is true on either side of the house, but now if you don't care about your life, that hierarchy is still going to tell you while your life is like kind of not that important, you might as well serve the interests of God. And that hierarchical structure still applies. But B, and more importantly, the warrants I've given you are reasons why the hierarchical structure of religion is still more inclusive in terms of what it tells you to do than the things that other systems like capitalism might tell you to do. And final engagement with this argument, it doesn't really matter what it tells you to do. It just matters that you assign value to it and that makes you happy. The POI just did not get a sufficient response. Third mechanism, people can actually make change in their lives and the lives of others, and that's a real benefit. So even if it's true that like determinism is there, even within determinism, what belief systems you have does preset what kind of outcomes you're going to get. And our claim is when you believe that you can make change, you take those additional steps, right? You actually make effort to contribute to your family, to your community. You try to edge up a little bit better and a small number of people actually agitate for change and try to change the world. And that can have really meaningful impacts. Before that, I'll give closing a shot.

    > POI: Obviously, this is dependent on your understanding of what it means to reject or define the self, but obviously that changes on the comparative. What do religious structures do on your side?

    I'm about to get there, but really quickly on this point, I think that when people agitate for change, it A, gives other people hope, but B, actually does create change. And even a small number of people trying to change the world because they believe it will help them get closer to God or make a difference, we think has a huge impact that Brian will weigh in the next speech. Why is the counterfactual worse? A, other individuals' narratives are still going to dominate the analysis from before. B, you might say you should just care less about your suffering. Here's why we think that this is not enough to overcome our case. The first reason why is just despair is stronger than suffering. People can adapt to suffering and that they can re-benchmark where they are over time and find a way to live with it. But also the margin of change in just forgetting that that suffering is happening is very, very hard on your side, not just because of other narratives, but for two additional reasons. One is that suffering has a physical element. Is that even if you don't care that your position sucks, like if you're hungry, you're starving, you're going to feel that pain either way. You can't really change that. And two is that suffering is a relational element. Is that even if you don't care about the fact that you are suffering, if your kid is suffering, you're still going to feel pretty terrible about that because they might not have the same beliefs as you. So what matters is that you believe that you can try to improve your condition and doing that still makes you a good person, doing that still assigns meaning to your life. At the end of the debate, change is going to happen slowly, but even when it comes to change, we get more of it. If we don't get that change, then what's most important is that people feel like their life has meaning. And for billions of people for whom change is too slow, they continue to trudge forward. We are exceptionally proud to propose the motion.

    We need to look for God in the machine, the structures which disseminate God's words for good and evil. We will talk about religious structures and why they are far superior under religions which reject the self. But firstly, three things to say. Firstly, as this has prefers motion, it's not retrospective, but it's just a general assessment of how this kind of belief changes a religion, what they teach people, but also the kind of structures which inform it, i.e. whether a religion with this doctrine is better than one without. Second thing to say is that, as you can see in the rest of this debate, oftentimes our understanding of what it means to reject the self or to center the self are based off of subjectivity and the connotations and the teachings and the interpretations which are foisted upon us or at least engaged to us by religious structures themselves. As a couple of examples for this, I think you can say that, for example, OG's idea about direct connection to God, you can say that that could be dependent on a mediator like a priest, or you can say that it's direct in and of itself, but that depends on what you understand rejecting or accepting the narrative to mean. The idea of differences, whether they matter in a moral sense or whether they should be something we should value, et cetera, all depending on how you internalize the rejection of the self in and of itself. I also think that the idea from DLO here on like gay people being accepted because of their choices like that is also dependent on what kind of structures the religions have and the incentives they have in terms of how they portray this belief towards people. The third thing that I want to say, and this is to do with closing government, is firstly, I just don't understand why we can't have agency and choice on our side of the house. That's not what this narrative is presenting to us. But secondly, I think that even if you don't have a sense of your internal perception of experiences being valuable as something you should strive for, that doesn't mean you don't fight for other kinds of purpose, which is to say religion oftentimes is based on the idea of morality and virtue. I think it's actually better in a lot of instances if someone is fighting for justice for themselves because they believe it is just rather than the instrumental benefits that they will get from it. Now, moving on to the extension, a couple of things. Firstly, why does this narrative form religious structures? Firstly, it's extremely strong because it forms the basis for all future doctrine, i.e. as a moral question of religion and the theological questions of your relation to God, you first must have an answer to the question of human experience, which is to say whether your lives are valuable or not. Secondly, I think they form from their nascency. Even if they don't exist in such defined terms at the inception of religion, the fundamental question of humanity, i.e. why do we exist, is one which religion seek to answer because science cannot. Therefore, this was a necessary part of the answer to that question in the initial stages of religion's formation. Thirdly, in terms of belief. Individual believers, when their religion was in the minority oftentimes strongly believe in the doctrine of that religion and form the structures of religion on that basis. And also this incentivization leads to two things. Firstly, you would get internal disagreement if you went against the message of the religion in terms of the structures, but also external criticism for being hypocritical if you set up a religion structures in a way that was antithetical towards the belief systems about that religion. Therefore, the belief system, or like this specific belief, is likely to form the basis of the structures of religion. How does it change religious structures? We would propose to that it becomes less hierarchical and it has more checks and balances and more accountable structures within religion. What are the reasons of this? Firstly, you have less incentive to seize power as a believer, as an individual member of the church, whether that be a priest or an Imam, et cetera, because you yourself don't believe that that experience of power will be something valuable in and of itself. Secondly, there's a conceptual translation here, which is to say, when you center the self, you center the idea of struggle and overcoming. It positions an ability for someone to be superior over others as can be pointed to, i.e. myself and my experience are better because I've seen more of the world or I have a better connection to God, et cetera. It's necessarily a qualitative thing that can be differentiated within people and also differentiated along levers of power, i.e. your ability to portray yourself as being that individual is not necessarily tied to your actual being of that individual. You also have less legitimacy then, therefore, if you were to try and seize power on our side of the house, because no one human experience is intrinsically valuable. No one understanding or interpretation of religion is intrinsically better, and therefore, greater experience is an overall better thing. Thirdly, I just think epistemically, you're less likely to tie into one individual's belief about what a religion is teaching you, i.e. like an individual priest or Imam, because you don't believe in the speciality of their experiences any more than you would believe in just the general understanding of things. Therefore, overall, it seems to be the case that religions are going to be less hierarchical in their structure, because the ability to seize power and hold onto it and not relinquish it is much, much decreased on our side of the house. Now, hierarchy. For the reasons outlined, religions developed to be less hierarchical, yet more councils and fewer popes. You get fewer priests being told what they must be teaching in their sermon on a Sunday. You get less individual priests not foisting their individual beliefs on their flocks. Therefore, you have three key impacts. Firstly, more checks and balances, because elite capture is extremely difficult under our side of the house, because you're less able to do things like manipulation, like acquisition of power, and the ability to do things like massively increased tithes when the harvest hasn't come in properly, the ability to hide scandals of abuse, and that kind of thing. You instead stick to things like altruism and virtue formation as the premises of your beliefs. Secondly, you get less rigid doctrine, because there's less power or incentive to have a set belief structure, because your self-understanding, your individual understanding, ought not necessarily take primacy within the larger religious structure, which means three things. Firstly, you get more liberalization over time as the trend of humanity liberalizing is now allowed to coalesce with the religious trend that is hamstrung on their side of the house. Secondly, you can get more personalized belief structures, i.e. individuals can attune their own beliefs based off of their experience of their life, based off of the holy book, or what they themselves believe to be their interpretation as being more correct. It's more flexible, and therefore gives people more fulfillment. And thirdly, you get less manipulation of doctrine towards the negative ends of individuals within it who attempt to seize power, who want to swing politics, or do other things like that. And thirdly, you just get less authority in and of itself, right? Because individuals' ability to pick and choose either whether they want to be a member of religion, or the degree to which they enter into that religion, or the degree to which they can pick and choose some beliefs, but not others, and get homeostasis between different religious beliefs is much, much higher on our side of the house. Before I move on to the weighing of this, opening government.

    > POI: If morality is now at the basis of meaning, don't religious authorities still rise rather than one where religions overall think that individuals have more say over their connection with God? Ideally, when religions respect choice, no matter that morality, it can't impose.

    No, no, no, because the whole point of it is that you don't have individuals seeking out power. So yes, individual religious leaders might want to portray morality or improve morality in the grand scale, but they don't believe that their interpretation of morality or their interpretation of the religion should be the one that takes primacy, and therefore they don't seek out that individuated power. Two elements of weighing along the rest of the debate. Firstly, most people do not engage with theological doctrine for most of their life, or at least specifically disbelief. Absent a justification of this from the rest of the debate, they're losing. Alterations exist, but they do interact with the structures of the church themselves, whether that means they're being tithed more, or being abused or manipulated. And notably, people outside religions are affected as well, like secular women or queer people being decided their rights by religious lobbying. Notably, the people who are the most into religion, i.e. the people that are impacted by the rest of the debate, are the most prone to abuse and manipulation. So on scale and vulnerability, we're weighing there. But secondly, these beliefs as an axiom can be spun by incentivized powerful individuals to mean a number of different things. Look at the top half clash, right? Does rejection of the self mean altruism? Does it mean vulnerable people suffering doesn't matter? We say that better religious structures means that you're more likely to get better interpretations and teachings of these beliefs, i.e. their actual impact in the real world on our side of the house uniquely. This beats top half, but particularly OG who are particularly hung on that comparative. The basis upon which you should adjudicate this debate is on which side do religious structures get better? Because of the instrumental benefits that gives to the largest amount of people, but also to the degree that it changes how these religions teach their beliefs in and of themselves. I'm exceptionally proud to oppose.

    It's quite telling that when OO tells us that suffering is inevitable, their only escape from it is just to ignore it, which is the framework that those in positions of power have wished to indoctrinate people on for the last hundreds of years. So I'm gonna talk about two things in my speech. Firstly, I wanna talk about why it is that in the context where it is true, that suffering is inevitable, the solace that you can get from centering yourself through religion is a priori in this debate. Secondly, I'll talk about why it is relevant, even if it is relevant to improve material condition, the only mechanism that is given to you in this debate is when Dvesh explains to you how agitation for change can actually lead to us living better lives. The first thing though I wanna talk about is the solace that you can actually gain from religion, because I think this was the biggest gap in opening government's analysis. They flag an argument about agency, but if you really look at it on flow, it's more so an argument about politics. Their only real line of analysis here is just that because you feel that everyone is special and that you feel that you are special, you should feel good about it. What Dvesh explains to you uniquely here is two things. Firstly, that the internal locus of control, that the sense of control is intrinsically good to you, but also that practically speaking, it is taking the first step and feeling as though you have control that can oftentimes lead you to have much more control and positive outlooks in your life. But secondly, it's also about the frame of reference. The fact that the other teams in this house try to compare centering yourself or centering your soul to things like capitalism, it's just an example of how they don't understand how it is that these types of religions can allow you to view self-improvement. It doesn't just come through the ways like charity that opening government talks about, but it comes through every little act that you can take to improving your lives or improving the lives of those around you. And when it looks like you improving on what you previously were in a position of, it is the easiest way in which you can achieve happiness, not just escapism, right? The first response that we get from opposition is that they say, ah, but maybe religion is bad. And so if you're coerced to doing bad things, then you are probably going to lead a worse off life. I wanna point out three things here, right? The first thing to point out here is that their only line of analysis here is that religion is bad because it is old. They don't actually explain to you why it is intrinsic in the reasoning why behind religion telling you to do things is always going to lead to worse outcomes. I have two reasons why this is probably not true, right? The first reason is that religions do have incentives to change, right? Especially ones that tell you to center yourself because these tend to be religions that want to proselytize and extend their influence. But secondly, note that religion is also becoming far more individualized. And this slightly deals with, but I'll also deal with more so about the hierarchy argument coming from closing opposition, which is to say that because you have a much more autonomous decision around your individualized experience with religion, the choices that you make in your view of what connects you to God is ever shifting and it's always improving to benefit individuals. At the end of the day, even if all of that is not true, the solace that this grants you, irrespective of what decisions you're making, it's also something that we would say outweighs any material harm that they could talk about. The second thing that they suggest is, perhaps this could end up starting religious conflicts or starting wars, right? I want to point out three things, right? The first thing to note is that this isn't a retrospective motion. So you can't just caveat to say that the status quo was really bad. So we have to defend the crusades on our side of the house. But the second thing to note here is even if you want to talk about this historical comparative, I would say that this comparative better looks like on your side when oppressors are allowed to do the fullest extent of their will, because there's no agitation to prevent further suffering when individuals have internalized that suffering is a necessity within their life. But even if it is true, even if it is true that this conflict will necessarily happen, I would argue a lot of the conflict that they talk about has tended to become agitation for good as history has progressed. Lastly, then I want to deal with closing opposition's argument on hierarchy, right? The issue with their argument is as such. They point out things like how fundamental control and abuse of religion can be bad. But the issue here is that this control and abuse of religion comes as the leverage of power. So the question then is, given that historically there has always been power imbalance and that people will always use whatever mechanisms they can to abuse this power and get themselves like selfish benefit, how then can you solve it, right? And the real way that you can actually get around this is when Depeche explains to you why the agitation of change is much more likely on our side. The comparative then becomes when you have the motivation, not only to improve the conditions of your life and follow, but also follow the most visible cues of improving the lives around you, you're most likely going to be able to shatter hierarchy in the same way that we see that religions that center yourself have gradually progressed towards becoming more individualized. But the biggest problem with both OO and CO is that there's literally zero reasons given why it is that on-net hierarchy is an intrinsically bad thing, right? We can see that there are no checks and balances, but then what? If people think that their lives are improving and feel more satisfied in their lives, we still win, right? Saying that religion is old and sometimes has traditional values is not a mechanism. We've mechanized why religion has the incentives to be inclusive and therefore will inevitably evolve through time. The mechanism here being very unclear is very important, right? Because if human experiences matter, then people are more likely to challenge hierarchy. They can see their acts on the earth and they're connecting them to God. So even if they disagree with their church, they can still push back. This is why the founders of Protestantism still believe the revolutionary action was God's will. Comparatively speaking, hierarchy still forms on their side, right? Even if your life doesn't matter, someone has to A, bring people in to convince them of a narrative that convinces them of that, and B, tell people what to do if they aren't spending time caring about their lives, right? Usually it means spending time serving the church instead of serving yourself since you've already been taken care of, since you're apathetic to your suffering, but the church will help educate others of the exact same thing going on into the future. I also think that this is a perfect transition to the second claim in my case, which is just that, why is it that even if it is relevant to improve material condition, that only ever happens on our side, right? I think both sides agree that material conditions, irregardless of your religious orientation, are likely going to affect you, right? And Devesh explains to this, that escapism isn't enough to deter this claim because physical suffering is conditioned on like nothing, irrespective of your mental state, but secondly, even if you don't care about your personal physical suffering, you still care about those around you. I think opening government's only claim here is that on the macro levels, things like charity can potentially help people. What I think is really important that Devesh pointed out here, is that people in positions where they seek to prove themselves naturally happens within the ecosystem that includes things like capitalism and politics. So in this comparative, when you're agnostic to suffering, you will never decide to create change, but when you care, you can feel as though you have a purpose to improve your lives. And naturally this takes progressions. Sure, for some people, this may look like incrementally improving your material sides of your lives, but for people who are in positions where they can create more change, this can look like groundbreaking movements where they want to improve the lives of those around them because they feel as though this is God's purpose, especially considering the fact that Devesh explained to you why it is relativistic to your position, what you need to do for the church, and we've got no response from closing opposition. At the end of the day, the three reasons why we outweigh every other team is firstly, we get more change, which is objectively good by everyone's metric. Secondly, if change is the wash, it is more important to focus on being happy. And thirdly, in terms of being happy, despair is even worse than suffering. You can't really change suffering, but you can add meaning to these people's lives. I'm very proud to propose.

    Well, the story of religion is that of beauty and the beast. Faith is beautiful, but hierarchies are bestial. The first thing I'm going to do in this speech is toss out the closing government case. They broadly focus on agency and the way that people can agitate for change once that is doing so. They have three broad mechanisms. The first of which is that you have this internal locus that you control, and the third of which is the ability that you believe that you can be the cause of change. We say these are similar enough such that these responses will deal with all of them. One, what's crucial is that the comparative of this debate is not the denial of free will in and of itself. It is to say that your individual experience is not important, but you can still have control over it. Note crucially, because religion wants you to do certain things and engage in certain actions, it's often actually going to say you do have a choice, but there is a right choice. That's often the pinning of value, which is within most religions. Therefore, these two mechanisms, which are crucial to most of their case, are not probably comparative. Secondly, crucially, I think on either side of the debate, people believe internally that they are in control of their own lives, that they have free will. Because think about the very way you ask a question when you're making a decision. For example, should I spend more time on OG or CG in this debate? The very idea of that question, presume the ability for free will that I can choose which one of those two things I will do. The very way we think and rationalize in making decisions, is just that we presume we are internally in control of our own lives, we have the ability to make decisions. Therefore, this is non-comparative. But third of all, and this is crucial, Dylan pointed out that we have people budgeting for change for better motivations on our side, for ideas of higher purpose morality. We say this is important because crucially, closing government don't say, that change is always good. If people believe that the ability to change the world, they may do so to gain control of a society which they shouldn't have control over. We say when you're doing it along moral lines for higher purposes, the change is more likely to be good. In more instances, therefore, if we even get less of this, we say it's more positive on the long run. The second mechanism they do is that you don't care about your life, therefore you're exploited. I'm going to weigh off here. Because crucially, we reduce the capacity to exploit people in other ways. Because first of all, it's less rigid text. So you're able to insert yourself and then negotiate with the kind of statements and the religious doctrines that are being put out with you. So you're not gonna be as easily exploited because you can kind of choose what action you want to take within the broad faith. And secondly, because it's less hierarchical, you don't defer to authority. You don't have the corporate capture you, the checks and balances. And that's the crucial part. Because secondly, even if the capacity is somewhat even, we reduce the incentive within religion to exploit. Because ultimately, non-religions are directed by virtue and councils where they're not all bribed and bought off and you can just buy off one Pope far easier on government side of the house. That is when you have faith that is not being used to exploit and to manipulate people. That is when you have faith which is genuine and is not exploiting people on the ground we have beaten. First thing, it's on agency. I'm going to rebut this. We point out in the POI that the very valuation of differences in and of itself is what makes you differentiate between people. If those differences are incidental, you don't care. The response to this is, yeah, because it's unimportant, we're going to attach some importance to it. Obviously, that's very hard to do within the faith where you're saying this is the self and characteristics and identity within the self is unimportant to then go forward, but my decisions were right and these are other. And this is the best part. The second response here, the parent identities on government bench. Because crucially, the people at the top of the hierarchies, they say my individual experiences is what is important because they relate to people. They can only use their own individual experience to prove this. Meaning you get very, very majoritarian identities being expanded by faiths. This is what we've seen historically through Christianity is what continuing in the status quo. So crucially, then you dissuade those unlike you, meaning ultimately you do get less, you do get more targeting of minorities and so on on their side of the house. The second broad case is that you will help others because their experience is special too. Note this first response to the first part of the case takes us out. Anyway, I'm going to just trade this off because crucially, as pointed out in the POI, if people are living according to higher purpose, this often looks like things like giving to charity. And if they're spending more time on this, this probably just trades off. The idea that, yeah, sure, you may have more motivation to help people because you believe they're special, but on our side, we have a motivation to help people because we believe it's what we're meant to do within this material world and therefore these things trade off. What are the responses we hear to our case? I just want to toss these out. The first is that there's still morality existing. So you get hierarchies as people just expand other people's things. Dylan responds very clearly that you don't seek out the power though. So you don't try to create a hierarchy within your religion, even if you are making moral statements. And the best part about this is, is that the reason why you do not create a morality, you do not try to create a hierarchy when you're calling out different moral claims, is that doing so would be a contravenience over... Morality is probably somewhat centered on rejection of the self. If the self is unimportant, you should not say be lustful or have huge... Should be at the top of this. That is... Contravening that very morality is something you are unlikely, in fact, not able to do anyway. Secondly, the up, good, which posits incentives to change over time. Sure, but you have more elite capture, meaning those incentives are reduced and also have more rigidity, meaning it's harder to change with the times you obviously win this comparatively. And third of all, the leverage of power, the idea that anyway, religion would have been used as a leverage of power. It would have been tried to, but we are clear. You have less ability to use religion as leverage of power because you have checks and balances. You have open interpretation and you have less deference to authorities. Dylan's case clearly lands. Before I weigh this all... Opening government shooting.

    > POI: So if it is the case that both narratives can be subjectively interpreted, then your side also can't make assumptions ...

    No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because if I take power, I'm saying I matter more than you. Crucially, if no individual experience matters, that is what's crucial in terms of deferring out a communitarian kind of rule. Obviously, there will not be no hierarchies because humanity is hierarchical. We have far reduced hierarchies on our side and you have better ability to engage with it. What does this do? It takes it over OO and they talk about exploitation because they posit one narrative which allows you to exploit people. We talk about the very capacity to exploit people and the way that people engage with those narratives. But we also crucially mechanized the idea of where the incentive to exploit people and how that becomes comparative. Meaning if this debate is about exploitation, we should be more persuasive than opening opposition. But would I also talk about escapism? And I think we're crucial here too. Because crucially, as the Deputy Prime Minister points out, there are other kinds of similar narratives. So this probably helps, but doesn't overcome the crushing world around you. So crucially, it makes OO quite marginal in the way that they delivered their own case. However, we have the best path towards escapism, towards accessing the good life. Because you are able to attach your own experiences, even though they're not important, because obviously that's just the way you think, to faith. Because it's more open. Because you're able to have the fulfillment and make your faith somewhat close to you and be able to relate to it easier rather than when it's about set identities. Meaning we access that escapism more. This also takes it over OG when they talk about agency and vulnerable groups. Because it comes in analytically prior and flips it. The incentive to discriminate. The ability to discriminate. That is where Dylan comes in before the opening government case on the analytical chain and flips it. But it also is easier to connect to the faith. The Deputy Prime Minister talked about the ability to connect to faith. We obviously flipped that when it's easier to connect to it individually when it's got less sect doctrine. So you're able to place yourself within it more. Panel, the story of religion is that of the beauty and the beast. Faith is beautiful. We maximize it. Hierarchies are bestial. We reduce them and their power. Thank you.

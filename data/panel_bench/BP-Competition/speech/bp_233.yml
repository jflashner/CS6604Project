    The stance of opening government is simple. This policy gives us the unique opportunity to take away all of the bad conditions attached to IMF loans in this debate. These are things like austerity measures, opening up free markets and other funds to come in and out from people, local funds, and those sorts of things. Four-part case from opening government then. The first part is that the IMF currently imposes really bad conditions going along with these loans. Yes, sometimes these kinds of things are necessary, sometimes they need a bit of austerity, but we're going to explain to you why the conditions that the IMF imposes here are going to be particularly bad, necessarily, in the predominant amount of cases. The first reason for this is that the IMF is dominated by economists, and people study those kinds of deals, which means that they have fundamentally been trained to prioritise certain kinds of metrics over others. So things like the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, the amount of government debt that you have, instead of the real impact that this has on people. Whether you're able to buy food and water, whether you're able to fertilise your crops so that they grow and you earn an income, the amount of poverty within your country and so on. Empirically, if we look at the European Central Bank, we've had a decade since the 2008 financial crisis, and throughout this decade they were pushing austerity, even though Spain had a 27% unemployment rate, because that is what they believed in, and they thought that getting our government debt was the priority, instead of ensuring that people had jobs and food and so on. The second reason is that we think these institutions are fundamentally dominated by the West. They're predominantly funded by states like the US, the EU, etc., who have their own interests in expanding their economies, develop trade that they have, and so on. They want to break into these markets and earn more for their economies. But thirdly, even if this is not the case, we still have China and other kinds of actors acting in this kind of place, we think that this is even worse, because the only unifying interest of all of these countries is to get their industries into these developing countries that have economic crises, which means that they force a high degree of opening up of their markets so that their cheap products can flood them there. You're never able to complete the end, that is really bad. What's the significance of this contribution to debate? Because on the top of this debate, OGCAP has already established that the IMF is going to impose bad conditions in the vast majority of cases. If CG wants to rely on the IMF being bad, they're reliant on this recognition that with this legalisation that we've provided in this debate, and you have to prepare an OGCAP for it. Part two. While austerity is really bad and destroys people's lives, this is something that the government has to defend in this debate and to impose side effects, which are usually things like government deficits. Why do we think this is something that is imposed in a large amount of cases? Because lots of economists think that this is important, they see this as necessary in order for their loans to be paid back in the future, there's a perception that countries like Spain or whatever, or the pigs of the EU etc, that these are lazy countries, lazy governments who don't crack down on social welfare programs and are this vision as the good German. Why do we think that austerity is really bad in these kinds of cases? I think it critically undermines government, especially when it comes to cases of economic crisis. Because when you have an economic crisis, you have a decrease in tax revenues, because the economy isn't producing as much, you have a higher degree of unemployment. But also, via automatic stabilisers, you also have a higher degree of expenditures, because you have to pay for more unemployment benefits, subsidies to businesses, and so on, and all of those sort of things. At this most critical moment, where your tax revenues are going down, and your expenditures are going up, when you're in post-austerity conditions, you mean that the state has to cut critical services that people rely on. These are things like fuel and food subsidies, as I mentioned, meaning that people aren't necessarily able to afford their most basic needs, and we think that's horrible. And I think these are really important things to individuals. But also, if they talk about economic recovery, this is also so much worse for economic recovery, because when you start cutting services and government expenditure and confidence in the economy, and people aren't able necessarily to spend as much anymore, then that also impacts the ability at which your economy is able to recover going into the future and provide better lives for people. Part three. Why free markets and opening up is really, really bad. I think this is something that we have to stand behind in this debate, because the input slide says things like market-based economic policies, so things like free trade, reduction of tariffs, not allowing protectionism anymore, but also things like market-based interest rates, which means now your interest rates have to be set on the global market, and because you're in an economy in crisis, you're not as cost-worthy, and the rates are going to be higher, as opposed to what you're able to do on GovEdge, where you're able to do things like state-run banks offering lower and subsidised interest rates to make it more profitable and more affordable for your businesses to take up loans. Why is this really important? Because I think there's two parts to this. First of all, in terms of international trade, it's just, as a small economy in crisis, it is incredibly difficult for you to compete with other bigger economies around the world. So if you're a small country that's trying to set up a manufacturing sector or those kind of things, you're unlikely to be able to do this yourself, especially in a time of crisis, because your economy is struggling. That's when American and Chinese firms are likely to come in and take up production and exploit your resources and buy up your businesses, because they're now able to do so with less international regulation. And now, suddenly, the benefits of that economic growth are not being kept within your country, but necessarily moved to other kinds of places. It means you're less able to protect developing and infant industries that might be more successful going into the future, exploiting comparative advantages, noting that in a time of economic crisis, you're specifically vulnerable to not being able to produce or having economic problems in doing so. Before I move on, CO.

    > POI: Yeah many of these crises were inflationary. Why would inefficient inflationary expenditure on things like fuel subsidies to end the economic crises?

    I just don't think most of these economic crises are inflationary. Like, if we think back to COVID, the economic crisis was caused by the fact that people weren't necessarily able to go to work, or global economic confidence dropped, which meant people were spending less money. If we think to 2008, there was too little demand in the economy, because following the financial crash, people weren't willing to invest. We want lower interest rates so people can invest in these kinds of situations. And finally, even if we get slightly more inflation in our world, even if things will come out ever so slightly slowly, we think it's more important to prioritize the people who need the money the most. I don't care if inflation is 2% higher. I want people to have food and fuel so they can live their lives. But for them, why would countries are going to take these loans from the IMF instead of alternatives such as China that are necessarily going to be wiser this way? Notice that under the status quo, a lot of these conditions are quite unpopular. Things like austerity are unpopular because they have to cut government services like education, etc. And we've seen this in lots of situations. See how political discourse in Greece is often about, we don't want more bailouts because that's going to make our economy worse, and we aren't going to be able to pay for our social services anymore. What that means under the status quo is that countries who look at these terms that the IMF is offering them, and see that it's not very unfavourable, go instead to alternatives, primarily China, because it's the largest country that is able to offer large amounts of loans and money and those sorts of things, and also sees itself as having a role in this kind of action around the world. The change is that uniquely when the IMF doesn't impose all of these onerous conditions anymore, the IMF with no conditions becomes more attractive than China with some conditions. And the reason why this is really important is because you just think China is an incredibly bad actor when it comes to this kind of thing. Yes, it doesn't necessarily impose Western values onto you when it gives its kind of loans, but it imposes things like political cooperation and the ability for China to increase its influence in the area, uniquely because China does not make a distinction between economic and political policies. It sees the state as a unified whole that's furthering both its economic objectives overseas, but also its political objectives, which is why they make you sign up to regional PACs that they've set up, or allow their companies to build and pour and then take over as a military base, and those kinds of things. The IMF is a primarily economic institution with lots of other countries that are likely to check each other. I think we deliver much better lives for people, and we prevent countries from going to worse sources. Very proud to propose.

    There were so many words in that previous speech, such as the truth, that it was actually quite staggering. Essentially, the characterization we get of the IMF is totally wrong. Obviously, the IMF increasingly is becoming an international institution that takes up its intake from a broad global base of factors. Yes, maybe they've gone to the West and studied there, but they're international. But also, I think, obviously, focusing on indicators about inflation and unemployment is a good thing, given that those are the primary terms of economic success, given that has been what has been agreed upon by the discipline as a whole. Look, I'm just going to be very basic in the speech. Firstly, characterizing what these countries have done, why they were actually fucked up in the first place, like we do to implementing these policies. Secondly, why they're unlikely to reform on their side of the house. And then thirdly, why even if these policies and conditions achieve nothing, the very signalling in front of itself is a good thing, but we're only signalling a case again, and it's going to be plus. So, firstly, why these countries have achieved default on their side of the house. Because obviously the way the IMF works, if there's a lender of last resort, right, essentially it doesn't fund development projects like things like the World Bank. Rather, it happens when a country is unable to pay back its debt. Yeah, sure.

    > POI: Just to have a clean debate, this motion is about the specific policies implemented in this recent economic crisis. Previous policies by the IMF apply on both sides of the debate.

    Fine. Okay. So how have these things, but there's a likely case in the future as well, because this is a motion that's going forward too, about how these crises have occurred. Well, potentially subsidies have led to problems insofar as they're universal, so they have to be done for everyone to lower a market price. Potentially national champions are incredibly inefficient and you're providing them subsidies so that's bad. Potentially your foreign reserves have declined because you're trying to prop up a particular interest rate in your countries, or you're trying to have a non-market-based interest rate setting. All of these things have led to these countries defaulting, and literally these are the likely cases of default in the future going forward. So obviously it's very good for the IMF to impose conditions that fix this. Now, the obvious question you're asking here from everyone's standpoint is that if these policies are good, why wouldn't governments do them? I think the reasons are actually obvious. The first is that in some cases governments have electoral incentives, right? So obviously these policies might be somewhat unpopular. Yes, austerity in the short term perhaps is seen as something unpopular. Yes, maybe shifting to a market base or cutting off subsidies, for example, will piss a lot of people off. Particularly given that these countries have electoral incentives, often they're unlikely or unwilling to bite the bullet to actually lead to long-term economic sovereignty. The other case that the IMF intervenes in are literal dictatorships that have limited feedback mechanisms. These are also obviously incredibly harmful given that they have limited degrees of knowledge perhaps. They don't have the best economy as hired. They aren't able to solve these problems. So therefore, in either scenario we say that basically the policies that the government is going to pass are continually bad. Why is market pricing mechanisms far better? We say that the market is able to price in, the market is able to price in the risk that these countries face to some extent, but also these countries have far more credibility as a result of the IMF bailing them out in the first place. Or at the very least, even if you forget the whole debate about interest rates and so on, we get rid of inefficient subsidies and that is a good thing in and of itself because obviously during a time of economic crisis when liquidity is low, pouring more and more money into a national champion that is unable to provide goods at a price that competes internationally is quite a stupid thing to do, right? Because it means that that has a giant opportunity cost for you and you're propping up a very inefficient company. But, even if these policies are neutral or whatever, why is the IMF including these things good? And here is where we make the signalling argument in and of itself. So on both sides now, you're unlikely once you default to some extent, at least in the short term, to get continued FDI and continued loans and so on from the government. But on our side we now have compliance with the IMF essentially to some degree dictating economic policies in these countries. And we say this in and of itself is likely to lead to massive credibility within them because the IMF is incredibly trusted. Often times members of the IMF have worked with the rest of governments or whatever and so on and have come back so they are the market makers within this. They have a good degree of economic credibility on the ground. But even if the debate is going forwards, the IMF has a credible record of past success. So for example, the Greek economy has actually been able to successfully recover after its bailout. Now I want to be clear here about why the signal of the IMF's timing policy is good in and of itself. And you know, people might think that signals don't matter in economics but that's actually why they're key. Imagine yourself sitting in like the New York Stock Exchange where you have a limited set of information coming from these countries. And then you get the information the IMF has come in and been able to provide policies that these countries actually need. That in and of itself is likely to reassure you and be like, oh yeah, these guys are now on a path to credibility and maybe it's worth funding them. And when they're able to comply with this in a one or two year period, that is when you get increasing degrees of this sort of funding so you're actually likely to get far better. Now, I want to here preempt the actual good government case in this debate, which is basically when you stand up and say that the IMF actually has more credibility, it actually lends to less people, i.e. it only lends to those countries which it's sure are going to be able to reform on their side of the house and implement some of these policies so it's more selective in its loans rather than lending to people who might abandon it. The first thing is I think this is a knife for opening government. But also I think that if the IMF would give less loans on their side of the house, that is actually bad because it means that more countries are cut off from IMF loans in general and that's when they turn to problematic alternatives like China, which opening government themselves have argued is an incredibly bad thing. That would be more investment in parts of the home they need to buy. But thirdly and crucially, the IMF is likely to overcorrect and not provide any funding at all. Actually, the reason is that there's always a risk of uncertainty now when you provide the loan because there's no guarantee that they're going to follow these policies. And given that the IMF is to some degree risk averse, it's likely to stop off all of its lending in general. But, even if the IMF is able to continue to give this loan, this is an even worse case for their side because what ends up happening, therefore, is that the IMF eventually in a second runs out of money, therefore, because there's no guarantee these countries are going to actually remain on a path of growth. Yeah.

    > POI: The electoral incentives and so on you described exist in literally any democratic system. Why is it that we see some countries fail and others don't?

    Yeah, so they agree in every democratic system. But, essentially there are external constraints, right? There are credible institutions in the best functioning democracies that mean that these countries don't collapse. You have this independent central bank setting market-based interest rates, which means that you're therefore able to succeed in the long term. That is what we get on asset power. And actually, that was good because that was my last mechanism, which is that now the institutions in this country have a mechanism to gain credibility because of certain market-based rates. So, for example, the way this happens is the IMF, in effect, creates a central bank to be able to determine, based on market-based forces, what the particular interest rate would be and what the loan should be. And so, therefore, you're able to develop. I.e. these countries with these policies are now put on the long-term credible path to growth, which is what their side of the house wants. At the end of this debate, I actually think this is a pretty clear and obvious win for our side. The IMF has some of the most talented and best economists in the world working for it. They are probably the people who are best able to ensure economic growth occurs. And even if not, the very credibility these countries gain from joining this policy in the first place is good. Very proud to oppose.

    First I'm going to frame what the IMF looks like, then I'll respond to O.O., then I'll talk about why these conditions are really, really bad. So, firstly, what does the IMF look like? They basically say the IMF is very international because it involves a lot of very educated people from around the world. We frame that this probably looks like people who were educated in Western institutions, even if they come from different countries abroad. And the reason for that is twofold. Firstly, that Western institutions often tend to be the most well-funded areas in humanities like economics, but also the people who train the economists are probably from a time when there was more privilege for people from the West, which means there's an extent to bias there. The difference, then, is that Western economies and the ways that people are trained are at a different stage of development. Western economies often tend to be at a different stage of development, in the sense that they have a greater competitive advantage over other countries. So while protectionism might be bad if you're someplace like the U.S., because you can export all of your stuff around the world, it might be good for a country that's comparatively at a lower stage of development, but you don't necessarily understand that if you've been trained with a certain frame of mind, that protectionism is bad. But secondly, these economists often value things like security and the immediacy of getting loans repaid, as opposed to the long-term economic outlook of the country. That's just because they're employed by the IMF rather than by the countries they're giving loans to. They're prioritizing IMF's interests. This means things like when we're talking about austerity and cutting the jobs of government workers, even though you might be able to repay those loans back faster because now you've cut a bunch of your government deficit, the economy will be fucked later down the line, but you don't care if you're an IMF economist because you've still managed to get your money back. This shows that the incentives are bad. Let's then respond to OO. So the first thing on OO is that governments are unwilling to implement these policies themselves, so the IMF needs to come in. So they say dictatorships don't want to. Firstly, these dictatorships probably just go to China instead, which Andrew has explained is really bad. But secondly, if these policies were so great as OO characterized, dictatorships and weaker democracies probably have the most ability to implement these things if they wanted to and they thought it was good, because they can basically do whatever they want without a lot of accountability. So if they thought it was a good idea and somebody informed them it was a good idea, they probably would do that. Then they say it's not politically popular. Yes, Andrew has explained why a lot of these things are actively devastating people's ability to afford food and fuel. It's not politically popular because it fucked people over. That's probably a thing to rally about. Let me talk about IMF signaling and credibility. So firstly, the lender of last resort characterization, that of opening off, probably undermines this. In the sense that you don't necessarily go to the IMF because you think all of their policies are a really good idea, you do it because you're desperate for money and you will do whatever the IMF tells you to do. This means that if you end up following the conditions the IMF tries to impose on you, there's no additional credibility that's left to your economy, because it doesn't signal the IMF is making good decisions or that you're making good decisions, it just signals that you are really desperate for money and that's what the IMF is telling you to do. Secondly, though, we dispute the characterization that countries even trust what the IMF is trying to do in the first place. There are so many horror stories of IMF conditions going wrong in places like Haiti, Nigeria and Greece, where thousands of people were laid off, where people couldn't afford basic necessities, where that country was fucked for future economic prospects because they imposed all of these conditions. This means that, like, this undermines the credibility claim because countries don't actually believe in what the IMF is telling them a lot of the time. Thirdly, then, on their point about less funding. So, firstly, this relies on the assumption that in the absence of these conditions, countries will have a far less ability to repay loans, the IMF will give less loans. Andrews explained how when you get rid of things like fuel subsidies, when you create things like mass unemployment in the country, that actually harms economic growth, which hinders your ability to repay loans, which means that, like, that point is undermined. But secondly, the IMF is still likely to give loans anyways for a variety of reasons. Firstly, there are quotas for how much countries have to contribute to the IMF, there's still that pool of money they have to loan out. Secondly, if the IMF is seen as a lender of last resort and they don't lend to countries when they have no other options, then the IMF is going against its mandate and probably gets a lot of flack for that. Thirdly, the IMF can still make money and show success stories by lending to countries without these conditions, which means that it gains more from lending than from not lending because if they don't lend, they don't get any money at all. Finally, the IMF can't risk people going to other lenders, and so it is more likely to just not impose these conditions than to stop lending to countries altogether, which means that we are still able to get more. Sure.

    > POI: What happens when you lift fuel subsidies?

    When we lift fuel subsidies, so when we lift fuel subsidies, like, I don't know, you guys are going to have to explain that, we've explained why fuel subsidies are really good because people are able to get fuel. Let's then talk about why these conditions are very bad. So a couple of ideas that come from our side. Firstly, that austerity often harms the growth of your economy. So when you're trying to reduce government deficits by cutting a bunch of workers, people end up being unemployed, they buy less, later on this harms the growth of your economy. They respond here that these crises are inflationary, this creates more inflation. Yes, but the immediate concern here is people getting fed. So if people cannot buy food because you've lifted all the fertilizer subsidies, that's definitely a more immediate concern than any kind of inflation that's going on. Secondly, Andrew explains to you why free markets are not the best for the developing world. So protectionism, while it might not be important for the West, is often super important for a lot of different areas around the world, because you need things like subsidies in the wake of rising prices. You need the ability to, like, boost your exports by devaluing your currency so that other countries are more likely to buy your exports. You need things like the ability to manipulate interest rates independently of anything that a global central bank sets, because now you get people to spend and save more according to the individual needs of your country. The IMF imposing conditions on you gets rid of all of that, and it sets it according to what Western economists think is a good thing. Okay, moreover, this often causes things like civil unrest and strife. So when global prices go up, you often need subsidies to keep things affordable. But the problem here is that IMF conditions are often very politically unpopular. And this is an independent thing from economic growth, because when things are politically unpopular, even if they prove that it might be good for the long-term outlook of your economy, if people can't buy food and they can't buy fuel and they can't turn their lights on right now, that causes them to go out into the streets and protest and riot, which is what's going on in Haiti in the face of things like rising food prices. This means that oftentimes, even if they manage to prove that austerity might be good in the long run, it creates political strife now, which harms your country's ability to pay back loans. Because if people are going into the streets and rioting, like they aren't doing things like going to their jobs, if this political strife happens, it harms the government's ability to actually push policies that help people. It's an independent way for us to win the debate. We've proven, firstly, that the IMF is often biased and not in the interest of the developing world. We've proven that austerity and other conditions the IMF implements are bad, very bad conditions. Thank you.

    Panel, the medicine isn't nice, but the medicine is necessary. Because when you have a problem, opening government's solution is to just chuck money at it until the money runs out. If government's run out of money, let the IMF chuck money at it. If the IMF runs out of money, oh well, we're fucked. Our solution was far simpler. Yes, it requires paying. Yes, it requires a decrease in living standards. But it avoids what Aniket told you about. A far worse situation where governments spend so much of their foreign reserves on trying to prop up their currency and trying to manipulate interest rates that they have no money left. And bear in mind, because these are developing countries, they do not have the wealth of capital reserves of the UK or the USA. They can't, as CG alluded, just chuck money at it like all countries can do to prop up their currencies. That money will eventually run out. And crucially what I'm going to prove in this speech is that I've come to a direct trade-off of actually being honest as being all part of growth. And that this is the best way to get them onto that path. So let's talk about that growth story. How do countries actually develop? On the face of it, it's actually quite simple. You just sell stuff, you build up foreign reserves, and you use those foreign reserves, like the dollars that you've been able to get, to buy knowledge in capital from abroad that allows you to develop high-income industries that can provide good jobs to your people. Why is it that the conditions, or the absence of those conditions, that prevent this from happening? I think Anarchet conclusively proved that part of the least resistance for governments is not to follow these conditions. In fact, insofar as governments accept that these conditions are bad, they must support governments not fulfilling these conditions. But I think Anarchet gives you a few structural reasons why they don't do it. Such as the incentive to lower interest rates before an election so that you can get more economic growth. Such as your incompetence relative to the IMF and your lack of understanding of markets and systems. Such as the fact that you have political incentives not to put these policies in place in the first place. Why is this so damaging to getting on that growth that we talked about? Firstly, your foreign reserves aren't now being used to do things like buy that capital and to buy that knowledge from abroad, which will actually help you to develop. You're using it to try and artificially inflate and prop up your currency so that goods become cheaper in your country for a short period of time, for that specific electorate at that point in time, fucking over the youth in the future. And crucially what I would note here is that money is spent at the expense of your domestic industries because you're using it to prop up your currency and artificially make your currency more expensive so that goods abroad are cheaper, so that people in the here and now can have living standards, forgetting the fact that those people also need jobs now and in the future to be able to save and to be able to have a good life in the first place. But secondly, it's like an opportunity cost on your budget. Because with things like fuel subsidies, I think Anket is able to conclusively prove, and the BPM does not rebut this, why this costs a lot of money. You're literally manipulating your entire domestic market rate, that is every single barrel of oil that is sold in your country, every single piece of fertiliser has a market price which you must be able to manipulate. With the sheer volume of money that you're putting into this, that comes at a direct fiscal government trade-off of funding things that the World Bank and the IMF think are the best ways for development, things that I think are uncontroversial, like, I don't know, funding schools, funding education, funding human capital development, which would make your country more attractive for investment, because if you have people who can do more productive things, then companies are more likely to invest in your country, build those factories, because people know maths, they know English, they'll build up tourism. This is the path to development that they uniquely block. I have no idea why they would do that. What are the responses to this? They say, yeah, fuel subsidies help people to live. Sure, but free-falling currencies and not having enough foreign currency reserves to buy grain, like Sri Lanka's situation, it can't be far worse on all fronts, such as how bad youth unemployment is, such as the lack of savings of the middle class, such as people's living standards in the future. But secondly, note they say trade liberalisation is also in this debate. So if Gov says these goods are essential to the extent that they must be subsidised, surely international market competition for the importance of these goods would not be on our side anyway. Secondly, I want to talk about the IMF, because they say that they do things that care about things like inflation and employment rates. I would agree with a couple of reasons why inflation is good and why it's the most important thing in this debate. Number one, it protects investment. Any foreign direct investment that you get, or any internal investment, is not protected when inflation is high, because the value of that money goes down. That is what inflation is. So if I put in £1,000, it'll be worth £20 if your inflation is skyrocketing. We are able to stem that trend, which means you can be sure when you put in money it actually has value, which means you make long-term investments. This is why on the comparative, by the way, we're more likely to be able to fund things like long-term investments, like schools, hospitals and roads, because that currency is not massively eroding in value over time. It's the sheer volume of the inflation. Two, just on a normal level, it is things like being able to have confidence that the value of the savings that you put in as a mother on a market stall will actually hold value so that you can send your kids to school for the next ten years, so that they can be able to develop in the first place. And finally, I think those savings on their side are bad because they have no value in the first place. That is when you lose confidence in your economy, you start not doing things like paying taxes, and that is when you get the breakdown of your economy. Why is this more important than austerity? I'll take TG in a second. Firstly, economic growth works with economics. So yes, we get less economic growth, we might get more unemployment in the short term, but that means people accept lower wages, which means that people invest more in these countries because there's a cheaper environment in general, which means more growth. It works in a cycle. However, inflation spirals and can only be controlled by progressively harsher measures. That is when you get worse outbreaks of things like social disorder on their side. CG.

    > POI: If all that people want is to get free money and for politicians to make populist decisions, why is Liz Truss not an office runner?

    Sure, I think that some people have the capacity to be smart and make smart decisions. I think that electorates in some constituencies, in some situations, might make the economically prudent decision, but the comparative is that some people won't, some electorates won't. Ours is policies which are enforced on all of these countries, which means that all of these countries do this. No forces. If they accept that these policies are politically popular, then nighting their opening, we talk about social unrest and people being unhappy about not being able to eat and clean, so they need to resolve that before they can even access that case. Finally, clear it in CG about this recent shit of COVID, and COVID meaning that you don't need this policy in the first place. While this is a very narrow definition of the motion, which relies on a very clear and very bended assertion about what certain words in the motion mean, we know the plurality of cases. But secondly and more importantly, we think we've proven that these reforms are positive things for developing countries, full stop, regardless of the context, meaning that we still take the vast majority of cases. Finally, COVID was inflationary, which means that it falls under the subset of cases that we're talking about. The fact that supply chains were disrupted because people at home increased inflation because it was harder to get shit to people, so that shit costed more. People were pulled out of the workforce because they were ill, meaning you had to pay more wages for people, which means that there was inflation. Insofar as that is the case, our case still stands because it is good for government to lower their budget so that they don't have to exacerbate that inflationary spiral. Inflation kills savings, therefore inflation kills hope. The only way to ensure development is to ensure that you take the medicine. I'm proud to oppose.

    I'll make one point in my speech. It's going to be better than anything I've said before, so it's going to win. I'll just start with one piece of weighing and one piece of rebuttal, and then I'll show you why we think that we don't want blanket policies on all countries, but rather tailored, specific policies that are good for the economic circumstances of each individual country, in which we will prove also why governments are likely to make good decisions on the counterfactual, filling in the link that OG Left and OO seem to challenge. Before that, one piece of weighing and one piece of rebuttal. Weighing. Andrew starts his speech by saying we're going to be contingent on their analysis on why the IMF makes bad decisions. You know why I'm so happy that takes him out of the debate? Because the InfoSci Bureau retells us what the decisions the IMF is going to make are. I don't think they've analysed any part of this, and this is why we think most of OG was in fact off the crash. If we just show concretely why the specific policies in this debate are often bad for countries, we are much better in showing why this will lead to bad decisions, as opposed to some abstract, there are differences between developing and developed countries, which don't ever link to why it means that these policies aren't also good for developing countries, like OO suggests. Secondly, response to OO. First of all, I want to point out, literally all of the OO material is contingent on one link, which is to say that governments are likely to make bad decisions, even when they know that it's bad. And I want to point out that they literally had just one reason for this being true, and that is electoral pressure. Governments are populist and they want to win more votes, even when it means giving people gifts. We come to the POI and ask them, why did the British people vote out this trust, who did give people gifts and was a populist and a bit of not very smart. We get the answer that some constituencies are smart and some constituencies are less. Putting aside that I don't personally think the British constituency is smarter than constituencies in developing countries, and I think many people can still see in their eyes when prices increase and there's an inflation, we have several reasons to think that specifically the populist case here is honestly quite good. A, we think that citizens, especially in times of crisis, where economic crisis is the main thing at headlines on the news, are very much aware of mismanagement by governments and do hold them accountable to this. Especially when inflation in particular is something that is very tangible and easy for me to see. I don't need to have complex understanding of macroeconomics to see that the prices are higher than they were a month ago, even though it's been just a month. So we think people are going to hold governments accountable to it for good reasons. Secondly, note how in many developing countries there actually isn't really much of a democracy, meaning that you are not held to many election processes where you care about immediately being elected and giving people gifts. But rather you actually have long-term incentives as a leader who is going to stay a leader for life or for many, many years, meaning that you do care about the success of your economy at large, even when it's temporarily unpopular. The rest of the rebuttal will be integrated. Let's get to the points. Firstly, why do we think oftentimes these policies are bad for governments? And I want to point out what our burden is. We don't have to prove that in all or even most cases these policies are bad for them. Only that in the cases that are changing by the motion it's bad for them. Because if we show that the government, in the case that these policies are good for them, would still opt for them voluntarily, we don't need the motion. Cool. What are the harms of these policies in some cases? A. We think that increased interest rates are very bad for business. This part OG already said. What did they not already say? We think that uniquely. A. Unemployment, which is something that comes as a result of the lack of businesses because it's harder to start a business when you need to take loans, which are much more expensive when you increase interest rates, are going to be more harmful to these countries than the direct harms of inflation. Reason being, inflation just means prices are higher. But to an extent, salaries are also higher. Not to the same extent sometimes. Difference being is, unemployment means zero salaries. And inflation would still happen even if just a bit less, meaning that the impact on people is worse. Secondly, long-term versus short-term. Inflation is a short-term crisis that will eventually end when shortages resolve, say when the war in Ukraine ends and we all have fuel again. As opposed to ruining the business structure in these countries, which means long-term implications because people lose jobs and you need to retrain them after a year out of the market, when you don't have businesses in the first place, etc. Thirdly, we think that some of them can actually use the current timing to use a comparative advantage. Because if they uniquely, the developing countries, don't increase interest rates or lower their currency level when other countries increase interest rates, it means that businesses have an increased incentive to move and shift into developing countries from the developed world, because this is a much friendlier business environment. And this is a unique advantage that they are losing. Secondly, obviously during a crisis of shortage of energy and food, subsidizing energy and food is uniquely important. It's approximated that about 30 million people in Africa are on the verge of famine right now because of lack of imported grains from Ukraine and other sources. This is something that can uniquely be solved only when governments make good decisions. Why do governments make good decisions on our side? A. Importantly, on both sides when they take IMF loans, the IMF can advise them. They have all of the expertise of a lot of places, they went to business schools and learned everything, because the IMF doesn't have to force them to just tell them what they should do if the problem is information. Secondly, because anti-corruption measures exist anyway, it means that governments will have to be transparent on both sides and justify to voters why they accept or don't accept IMF proposals. The IMF would post what they propose, it will be on the news, people will ask politicians why not accepting them, they will have to justify in this particular case. Thirdly, central banks do exist in many developing countries, and you know what else? The IMF anyway, on both sides of the debate, demands increased independence for central banks. This is not a unique policy in the infosite, this exists in any day. Opening.

    > POI: The UK voted out trust because the IMF criticised the trust plan set the UK markets into free fall.

    Thank you. Okay, just get into that. You know the funny thing? The IMF would criticise the political leaders for this on both sides of the debate. I literally just explained, information is not an issue. You can advise them anyway and you have to be transparent. Central banks also exist, independence of central banks would be demanded anyway. Further, we think that A, it is in the direct interest of these governments to have a successful and economically flourishing population, not just a population that would immediately vote for them for several reasons. A, to increase their relative power in the global arena, they want to attract businesses, they want to have economic growth. And this is something that gives them more power because later today they take taxes that they cannot, because they're elite friends and so on, so they do want people to overall be happy. But secondly, because they want in the long run to prevent unrest. It's not enough that people just immediately vote for you. If they're going to end up in mass protests like happened several times in Venezuela, because people were very unhappy with being starving, this is something that is bad and uncomfortable for politicians. They need to send them on retreat. It is very bad for their functionality. This means that they, again, have an interest for good economic policies. They will listen to the IMF when it's good for them. But in the cases that it isn't, we shouldn't force it. Thank you to propose.

    I want to make one observation in starting this speech, which is that opening government themselves provide the logic to explain why the IMF does not do these loans and these conditions in the deeply uncharitable ways that they describe, that is to say, prevent countries from doing literally any pandemic relief, because, as they know, it is in conflict with other blocs, other blocs like China, like ASEAN, etc. And what that means is I think that the government has to defend, as closing government correctly observes, these specific policies indicated in motion, which means that you're likely to get rid of policies specifically disliked by economists, things like immensely costly and inefficient fuel subsidies, rather than abandoning literally all pandemic relief. What I'm therefore going to prove for the rest of this speech is just to explain why these specific policies specified in motion respond very poorly to the specific context of COVID-19, noting also that the imperative for this debate is the removal of all conditions, something which I think closing government is insufficiently engaging with. Alright, firstly then, why these policies deal with the COVID crisis, or actually, why these countries deal with the COVID crisis poorly in the status quo. I want to note from the outset at this point, that this explains, I think, better than opening opposition does, why these states make mistakes, because I think it's pretty fair for closing government to be like, well, why don't these states just make correct decisions about their own economies? But I think this material explains why what appears to be a correct short-term decision ends up prolonging inflationary crises in ways we should know. So firstly, what is the nature of the crisis these states are facing? I would just note that it is extremely inflationary, like, empirically true, and that's for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it's because of an initial supply shock, but importantly, it is not transitory, like, even the Fed has admitted that, because following that, there are two dynamics that prolong inflation. Firstly, inflationary policies from governments who overreact to the initial supply shock flood the economy with money that then achieves less productivity. And then secondly, reduced trade volumes and COVID, which means that there is less productivity to chase with all that new money. And I think that this responds somewhat to closing government, who I think rely a little bit too much on this inflation being transitory. You can't just wait it out. It's still going. And so I think that that suggests that you need to engage with the specific context that we're engaging in. I would also note, I suppose, that this debate isn't just about one country. Like, there's a lot of countries who face inflationary crises, and that means I think you get things like a race to the bottom if they're controlling interest rates in order to attract corporations. You don't successfully attract companies to come do business in your country. You just have a below-efficient inflation. The second thing to say, then, is how the policies, like how these kind of policies, like fuel subsidies, like trying to artificially lower your exchange rate, how that affects these specific countries. The first thing to say is I think you likely get into inflationary spirals. And that's to say that things like subsidies, which I would like to note are huge, like countries like Mexico have spent literally 1% of their GDP on fuel subsidies over the last two years. They become decreasingly affordable over time. Like, as your economy gets worse, you are less able to continue to prop up those industries. What eventually has to happen then is you have to take those subsidies off and go into a massive supply shop that people were unable to adjust for. I think that that is probably pretty terrible. But additionally, you become decreasingly productive as the value of your currency, which goes down, becomes less appealing to investors. Like, there is less development occurring in your country, which means there is less productivity for all this money floating around to chase. Additionally, you become decreasingly able to pay back loans. Firstly, because loans are often denominated in USD and the US interest rate empirically has gone up hugely. But secondly, because given that your productivity falls, your currency becomes worthless. And that means that you now have to pay more back on your American loans. But also, it's more expensive for you to do so in your own currency. That, I think, means that you are a decreasingly trustworthy state to lend to as these crises go on. So that goes to suggest that these crises must be dealt with in the short run. It's not good enough to wait them out. They get worse over time. The second thing to say is that policies suggested by GovVeg are terrible in a number of ways. Firstly, they're hugely regressive and inefficient. Inflation, for instance, is terrible for poor people. I would note that a lot of poor people in developing countries are not hugely indebted because they have very little borrowing power, but they do have huge amounts of engagement with consumer markets. They have to buy products. And when those prices go up uncontrollably, they are the first on the chopping block. They're also vulnerable to cost-cutting. Their jobs are the first ones on the chopping block as well. Secondly, subsidies, et cetera, are deeply ineffective. They reward the people who consume, for instance, the most fuel. They're captured via windfalls by industry. Fuel companies just absorb those subsidies and do not pass them on to consumers. And as I've already explained, they're unsustainable. All of that means that these economies become incredibly unstable. And that is terrible for your reasons. Firstly, unions and trade relationships are less reliable. Secondly, it deters foreign direct investment because investors do not trust your economy to stand up. Thirdly, it means you have to engage in costly currency production that clearly is unsustainable. And fourthly, it harms democracy for the reasons that opening government observes. The final thing I would note is that this is really bad for the industries that we probably like. It is the industries that create growth that require investment. Rather than primary industries that like low exchange rates, we probably want to propagate in these countries. I would also finally note that fuel subsidies have put Latin American countries back literally like five years on climate commitments. I think this is probably pretty fucking bad for climate change as well. All of that goes to suggest that these specific policies that we're engaging with in this debate do not work and are just terrible. Terrible for these countries' economies. Before I move on to some stuff about corporate capture, I'm going to take opening.

    > POI: Reducing inflation sounds nice, but the question from OG is whether you'd prefer the EU doesn't subsidise fuel at all and lets poor people stuck at freeze this winter.

    I'm responsive to my intro. You can do transfers that help the poorest of people without sinking 1% of your GDP into terrible, environmentally destructive and unsustainable subsidies. Come on. Alright, why then does this empower corporate capture in a really terrible way? The claim here is really powerful because it explains how the policies they describe are likely to be done in bad and inequitable ways. But additionally, it explains why you actually don't go back to normal after a crisis clears because you undermine these governments in a structural sense. Firstly, where governments have the capacity to intervene to protect particular actors, for instance by artificially suppressing exchange rates, that creates huge dividends to corruption. It gives you as an oil company huge benefits if you can do corporate capture because that government is able to intervene on your behalf. If it's not up to the market, you simply, straightforwardly cannot do this. So this is a government that structurally empowers corporate capture that worsens corruption. The second thing to say is that in times of crisis, governments have a seemingly rational incentive to prop up their largest industries, but note that that entrenches those industries in the very governance of that country and makes it decreasingly hard to do things like roll back subsidies even where they're incredibly unsustainable and inefficient. And thirdly, I just want to note that the argument I've made about how this de-incentivises investment and de-incentivises growth worsens the corporate capture, like if it's the case that there is less crisis in tech development because the currency's gone down the chute and you're not considered a reliable country, that means your government is way more likely to prioritise industries like oil, industries like agriculture, which can then do corporate capture and prolong the very terrible economic conditions that I've described. At the end of this speech, I think it's very clear that Closing Opposition is the only team that's actually engaged with the actual context that these loans have occurred in and the actual economic policies which these countries have embarked on. So, so proud of them.

    Two things in this debate. First, can governments make good economic policy and make good decisions for themselves? And second, where we take away the competitive advantage of these developing countries that need this money the most. First of all, I want to point out something about Closing Government. What Closing Government analyses to you – Closing Opposition, okay – analyses to you is why an economic crisis is really, really bad for poor people. Look, we genuinely agree with this state. I agree that inflation and I agree that lack of productivity and I agree that all of this is bad. The question is, on which side of the debate do we manage to mitigate it more? I think that what they don't engage with is that we showed you the ways that these countries have to get out of this crisis or to mitigate it by – I'll tell you, by getting people to open more businesses in their country, by getting other investors in other countries to come into this country because of the comparative advantage of lower interest rates and the fact that the currency is currently lower, interest rates are going lower as well, meaning that they have to invest less to do things in this country and to buy exports from these countries because they're buying them in a currency that's lower value. That's exactly when these countries have a comparative advantage and the ability to get money or to get their economy back on their feet that they wouldn't otherwise. Even if on their side what they do is have less subsidies for oil and gas, they never show why that is enough to get them out of this economic crisis in the long run. Maybe it mitigates some of the damage that's happening right now, but we're the only team to show you an active way out. Without analyzing this, their case just doesn't stand. And notice that I genuinely think this is new material if it comes out in WIC, right? Because I have no ability to engage with the actual mechanisms for how they're going to get things different on the way out. What they can try and do is weigh less subsidies over more companies, but I think that because companies and because exports give you an immediate impact on people's lives because it gives them salaries and it gives the government more money in order to be able to do more things with immediately because of the exports and companies that are coming in, we think that the direct impact on people's lives is so much larger than maybe somewhere down the line less subsidies bringing benefit. Let's get into it now. Why do we think that governments are able to decide what their economic policy is? What happens on top half? Top half basically says sometimes these policies are good, sometimes these policies are bad. Opening government gives you several reasons why these policies could be good. Opening opposition gives you several reasons why these policies could be bad. What are the opposites? I don't know. What opening opposition then tries to do is say that governments are not going to make these decisions because it's unpopular. I think if I take that down, what does this do to the debate? In the cases where it's good policy, we think it's going to happen on either side of the debate, but what changes is whether we're forcing it upon countries when it's also bad. The reason they gave for this is populism and the fact that it's the path of least resistance and people don't know what they're doing. How do we answer this? First of all, their political reasons or incentives that they give are true for a normal political situation and not for economic crisis. We think that when there's an economic crisis, that's exactly when people want to see change. They want to understand what the government is going to do in order to fix this economic crisis right now. We think that is the point where people do think long-term and understand long-term implications because these discussions are being had about how to leave the economic crisis and discussions about inflation and discussions about interest rates is exactly when this kind of thing happens so people know it more. But also, they're more likely to listen to what the IMF is telling them to do and its advice because if they don't know, what they're going to default to is default to expertise, is default to people they think might do a better job in their government. People are going to be supportive of what the IMF wants to do. This means that all of the benefits on the upside happen in the cases they want it to happen. The times it doesn't happen, the times where it would cause harm, is where it doesn't happen on our side. Notice that all of these reasons engage significantly better than just the reason that opening government gave you where it might be good policy and they can do it whatever they want, significantly better than what opening government did with opening opposition. Also, last thing, note that the comparative on both sides is money, right? On both sides, they get money, the question is what they do with that money and on our side, we give them the ability to do what's best for their country. So, why do we take away the comparative advantage? What did opening government tell you? Opening government talked to you about basic needs and the government's ability to subsidize important things for the people. Oh, oh, rightfully attack them on this and say that when there is a default, when there is an economic crisis, the government isn't able to do those things anyways. That's why our addition is so significantly important because we give you the comparative and explain why on our side, the steps that you can take when you don't impose that policy and the natural processes that happen when you have a comparative advantage to other countries allows you to get more money, allows you to do things that make the economy better at the end of the day, meaning that the government has more ability to actually do the things and give the basic needs and maybe not subsidize the things that it wants to subsidize on our side, meaning that even in an economic crisis, it can do more than it would have been able to do on the other side. Opening opposition say that what happened is that subsidies is what caused a lot of this crisis in the first place and therefore if you continue to subsidize, that's going to be bad. Notice that literally this is an assertion. Look at your notes and if it doesn't analyze this at any point, he just says that a national champion is bad. I don't think that's true. I think that what likely happens is that these countries are dependent on other countries in order to help them with their economy because they're usually exported, because usually what they do is give cheap labor for other countries and what other countries are less likely to consume. That means they have less influx of money. It's not yet. What we show is why even if that's true on either side, comparatively on our side, you have more consumption from other countries and more of these other countries trying to help you because you have a comparative advantage. Now I will take closing if you have anything.

    > POI: Yeah, if it's true that countries just make decisions that are good for them, why is Texas currently spent 1% of its GDP on inefficient petrol subsidies?

    I think that maybe in some cases they will make bad, but we show you why it's more likely that they make good choices on our side. I don't have to defend no one ever making mistakes, just show you likelihood. That's why it's about a consumption crisis. That's why it's crucially important that we incentivize other countries and consumers from other countries to continue to consume our products even if it doesn't solve it entirely, it still shows a comparative advantage and why we get more money than we would otherwise. Why is this more important than anything else in this debate? Notice that A, we just think in the long run it means people get more money, both because of the things we showed you, but both because when we show you that countries are more likely to pay back their loans and more likely to show that their economy is growing as a result of this, that's when the IMF trusts more to give more countries things and has more money in the first place. But also we just think that it successfully pulls in companies or pulls in consumption that doesn't necessarily go away afterwards, so then it saves more time. Notice that this is logically prior to civil unrest, so when we show you the way to avoid civil unrest on our side, that is significantly better and shows you your ability to avoid bad alternatives like China in the long run as well and in the next economic crisis. Because we showed you the only way out, please vote CG.

    Two parts to this speech. Firstly, proving why the IMF has greater incentives and capacity to impose conditions well. Secondly, why independent incentives, the specific conditions we are debating, are good. Firstly, who is the best at imposing these conditions? The first thing I'm going to do here is look at opening government. They say the IMF has bad incentives and the mechanisms here are one, it's run by wealthy neoliberal economists and economists care about getting money, they don't care about countries they're learning to. I just want to note that basically all of opening government's harms of subsidies being good, austerity being bad, rely on the benevolence of the IMF. And the reason for that is because it's true that austerity is sometimes good, sorry, sometimes bad, it's true that subsidies are sometimes good, but obviously that's not true all the time. Austerity can be good in times of hyperinflation. Subsidies often, as we explained to Nobel laureate Ellie, support zombie industries, stifle growth, and commit cronyism. That's bad. The question is then, is the IMF able to impose these conditions prudently where they are necessary? Ellie gives a reason of competition, which is conceded by opening government, that if China is supporting these states, clearly the IMF has an incentive to make those good. I'll give additional four reasons. The first is that the structure of the IMF is democratic, which is to say all states have a say. It is not just notoriously controlled by the US. Secondly, other blocs exist, like ASEAN, so states can pull out of the IMF so people know that. Thirdly, the IMF just improves through time on the basis of things like governmental or domestic pressure, on the basis of history and data that people can learn from. Look at the way that, for instance, I'd like to see heavily invested poor countries change from being pretty punitive in 1996 to way, way less punitive in 2006, giving Zambia a $4 billion bailout on the basis of that data, on the basis of that domestic pressure. Fifthly, I just want to say that the IMF has way more capacity to collect information than other actors do. That is why the opening government claim absolutely falls out. We then get the flip side of this from closing government, who say, well actually, here are some reasons why domestic governments are good. The first observation I want to make here is that this debate occurs for countries which make the mistakes. We're not dealing about average domestic governments, we're dealing about the domestic governments who are coming to the IMF because they are in an inflationary crisis. What do they say? They say use the countable, because citizens are aware of government mismanagement and inflation is tangible. The first reason this argument falls through is that people do feel economic hardship, they're right that inflation is tangible, but they don't explain why that means people have the specific information about particular policies or government decisions that would reduce that inflation, right? I think it's more likely in the worst case that people just don't have economic answers, they turn to populism, they vilify racial minorities as being the cause of their economic grievance. Or, more generously, people just demand hugely inflationary subsidies, that yes, are good in terms of giving them a bit of money, but massively worse than inflation over time. Secondly, often you're unable to hold non-democratic or imperfectly democratic governments to account, right? Elections don't work perfectly in many of these states. Thirdly, even in perfectly democratic states, elections occur every four years. Some people are one in two voters. It's incredibly unclear that you have that kind of power. The second claim they make is that governments themselves want growth and they want to prevent unrest. The first thing I note is that short-term growth obviously can be profitable for the government in power, or getting money from a corporation, for instance, helps you. I'm pleased that that's going for your economy overall. But secondly, I just note that empirically, governments have been bad at doing this. Note the observation at the top of this issue. And that's not necessarily because those governments are stupid or evil, it's because managing inflation is really hard. Like, the economic decisions are really difficult. It's important we outsource it to the IMF, who has way better capacity, way better information. I note that there's often short-term political pressure to do inflationary transfers in ways that have turned very bad. And you can obviously, if you're a state that requires this to prevent uprising of your people, prevent unrest in other, more pernicious ways. But the final thing is that our extension clearly responds to this, right? Because we explained why corporate capture is far, far worse. And that is the reason why even maybe initially good governments are worsened by the existence of these kind of subsidies that prop up these sorts of zombie industries that allow them to capture corporations. That absolutely falls through. I just want to note the importance of this rebuttal. It clearly gets us over opening up to people who say, well, our bad austerity is worth the trade-off in development. We say, you don't have to do that trade-off, right? Because the IMF imposes conditions well. Secondly, it clearly rebuts closing governments' claim with that issue. The final thing closing governments says is they're like, well, the IMF can just advise countries. Clearly a huge difference in scale. We would rather actually have good policies imposed. But secondly, if the IMF is so mullet at the lip as their opening suggests, I'm clearly going to advise these countries that they're not taking your vote. Second part of this, the agenda. Specific conditions being debated are good. Before that, yeah.

    > POI: Opbench needs countries to take nasty IMF medicine. If IMF conditions are so good, why do countries reject them or go to China?

    I just don't think it's true. Sorry. The response clearly is that governments sometimes have bad incentives, so they don't always want to take the loans. We think the loans are actively good for citizens, right? That's the claim being made. But also, I would just contest that countries hate the IMF as much as you're suggesting for all the reasons I've already given. So, what are the specific policies we're dealing with? We explained very clearly and with a huge amount of analytical depth at LE that IMF conditions give developing states a path out of the COVID crisis, which is necessarily inflationary, but their side makes inflation worse, and it just has a whole other range of harms. Things like fuel subsidies massively worsening conditions of climate change. That is obviously terrible. What responses do we expect to this? Firstly, closing government is like, well, you guys have no alternative. Firstly, even if we didn't, we're saying this makes inflation worse, so it's a harm you should be avoiding. Secondly, clearly you do have other policies that exist. We can support direct transfers to the poor as opposed to other inefficient subsidies. And I know that most economists support some degree of intervention. We think that happens on our side. The second claim from closing government is like, well, here are some reasons why the specific policies are good for developing states. They're like, firstly, increased interest rates harm businesses. I assume that's bad. I would note, firstly, that if inflation exists on either side, I guess increased interest rates are to some degree memorable. But more importantly, this is not true. Businesses are more scared of rising inflation than they are of rising interest rates because increased interest rates only defer to borrowing. But investors, if they don't believe that their money is going to be worth anything, aren't going to invest at all, which is why that's a comparatively greater harm. The second claim is like, well, inflation is short-term, so you shouldn't restructure businesses. Clearly we explain this as being a long-term issue and you should not have the kind of economic structure that makes you vulnerable to inflation in the first place. The final thing is like, well, food subsidies are good. I don't think this is specified by the interest rate, and clearly if people need money for food, we think those are kind of humanitarian measures that the IMF is not getting to stop countries from getting to. So this is incredibly important. We think that we explain that regardless of incentives, these policies are good. And the final thing that we explain again to no response is why this makes corporate capture worse. I know that that was prior to the clash about good or bad incentives. Right? We explained that even good governments are massively vulnerable to TNCs. The final thing I'll really quickly remind is a claim from OG that states will hate these conditions, then they go to China, and that's bad. Firstly, that suggests that there is a competition with the IMF, which undermines their first benefit. Secondly, it relies on people hating these conditions. We explain why not. Third, it just assumes a tipping point in terms of states being ported by China. Fourth, they assert without proving that China is bad. I think the BRI is pretty good in many ways. It clears the argument. Thank you.

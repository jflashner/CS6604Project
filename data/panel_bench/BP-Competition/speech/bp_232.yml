    The world of opening and closing opposition is a world where academia is seen exclusively as the domain of the left. And the consequence of that is that it has led to substantial opposition towards academia and has weakened its place in society. But more to that, it's also led to the right increasingly not relying on well-founded views, well-documented views, well-proven views. Because the source of those views and the source of the legitimacy of those views has been stripped away from them from politics. I'm going to do three things in this speech. Firstly, briefly on set-up. Secondly, on opposition to academia. And thirdly, on what this does to discourse and research. Firstly, on set-up. Three notes on set-up. Firstly, what does the status quo look like? We think the status quo looks like a dominance among academics, among curriculum, among students, and amongst the general output of universities. Which is to say, that dominance has permeated through all of universities. There aren't healthy pockets of conservatives. There aren't particular factions of conservatives that have sway, that have a voice. They don't have any capacity to push back against the leftist sway. Secondly, what does the counterfactual look like? We think the most probable counterfactual in this debate is a diverse and healthy mix of political views that exist. That is not only because it's very difficult to form a dominant majority from any other particular position, given that the helpful rise of leftism has been somewhat of an accident. But it's also because each of those groups has strong incentives to make sure that their voices are heard. So you would imagine that in a vacuum, the likely absence of dominant leftism leads to a mix of more healthy political views. We think it's extraordinarily unlikely to look like a dominance of right-wing views. But moreover, we also think that even if you believe it looks like a dominance of right-wing views, those right-wing views are unlikely to look like the most vivid, the most aggressive views. Why is that the case? Two reasons. Firstly, because we think the context of universities is not conducive to those views, because they have to be demonstrated to have some basis in reality, to have some proof behind them. And those views factually do not. Secondly, we also think that the context of differing political views all having to clash against one another typically weeds out the most extreme, the most radical views, which is why the most likely counterfactual, even the most favorable one for these guys, doesn't look like bigotry having its place in academia. But the third and final note I can set up there with me is that leftism and liberalism, much to many debaters' dismay, is not an a priori good in this debate. It's not assumed that leftism and liberalism is what we ought to be standing behind in this debate. And it's incumbent upon this opposition bench to explain to you that things like individualism, things like reasonable, sensible, progressive policy done through conservative lenses, doesn't have significant value and shouldn't be what we care about in this debate. Before I move on, closing.

    > POI: If the right-wing can moderate the most extreme versions of their own views, why couldn't the left-wing do it as well?

    The left-wing doesn't do it in the status quo for the simple reason they have no incentive to moderate. When you have complete dominance, there's no reason to moderate behind. The only incentive is to keep proliferating views. But more to the point, the capacity to moderate is limited when those opposing views aren't brought to the fore like they would in our world. So, what does that mean? That means that this debate is primarily about why a healthy mix of political views on university campuses leads to benefits. Which leads me to my first point of constructive. Opposition to academia in the status quo. The reality is that the status quo is not one where everyone buys into academia. Both from a structural political level, but also on the ground with respect to how people view the research and the policy outcomes that come out of university. That is primarily because around 50% of the world views academia exclusively as the domain of left-wing elites. People they are fundamentally oppositional to. Let's explain why that's the case. The first reason is that there are a series of parties that have strong political objectives to delegitimize universities. That is the right-wing. Why is that the case? That's the case because when the left has dominance over universities, it means the output of those universities becomes threatening to the right. Either because it's producing more left-wing students that undermine their voter base. Or, to the point, it produces more left-wing policy outcomes which undermines the right. It's very hard to make a justification for why we ought not vote for climate change when all university academics say that we should vote for climate change policy. Unless you're able to say that universities are corrupt, left-wing, nonsense, high-falutin places that we should have paid no heed to. And that means powerful institutions like right-wing media run by Rupert Burden or right-wing politicians that dominate half of the political discourse across the world have strong incentives to constantly reduce the effectiveness of universities. And they have two tools to do so. The first of which is undermining it through discourse by suggesting that we ought not pay any heed to it. And the second of which is to directly, politically attack it. By defunding universities. By making it more difficult to access universities. By promoting alternate pathways through life and suggesting that universities ought not be something that we should engage with. And the consequence of that has been that around the world, despite attendance rising in universities, funding hasn't risen for universities. And universities have increasingly had less and less effect on the political domain. But secondly, we would suggest that even to the extent that you don't believe that structurally they're being politically harmed, the cultural buy-in for universities diminished significantly. Which means the research that's being produced from universities, people on the ground from the right, don't buy into it. They don't think we should pay any heed to it. They don't think it should be something that's considered in the first place. What are the two impacts of this? Firstly, research and well-founded opinions have significantly less sway in the opposition world. That's important because in this debate, irrespective of the political position of the ordinary intelligent voter, you would have to suggest that well-founded opinions, opinions that have been subject to the marketplace of ideas and the willing down to that which actually has impact on our society, should take precedence. Because the context to a side opposition is that even if you believe that the left is still informed by academia, the right increasingly isn't. And the right still is going to be in power 50% of the time. And we would prefer that that 50% of the time, they're basing their policies on things that we know will have the impacts that they want, that we know will have the impacts that are desirable in society. But secondly, we would suggest that there's harmfulness debate for universities to be funded less. We would suggest that there's an a priori good for people to be more educated, for development to increase, for globally, for us to have more capacity to do good through the mechanism of universities. That's only possible in a world where they're well-funded. Our world solves this problem by not only aligning the interests of all parts of the political sphere towards universities being funded and supported, given that they only stand to benefit now, but also by reducing the capacity to attack universities by suggesting that universities are no longer the left-wing domain. There's no rhetorical sway that they're able to thrust over the left now. Finally, and Dan will expand on this more in depth with me, what do we think the effect of research and discourse is? Notably, side opposition has to defend a world where political views are being formed in a non-critical echo chamber. Sure, the Marxists might criticize the Leninists, but that doesn't lead to an actually thoroughly reputed opinion. It's only in our world where research from all swathes of universities is able to be actually checked and actually balanced. Side government is the side that stands behind political views being formed in a coherent way rather than an absurd way, which is what side opposition has to stand behind. Thank you.

    Acknowledging the structural injustice at the core of society is critical to rendering education as accessible and empowering to its students as possible. A couple of things in the speech. First, what is the alternative? Then reputation, then two constructive arguments. First, on why liberalism and progressivism is something that good and why that spreads to society. And second, on why the dominance of left and liberal views on campus has made it far more inclusive and far more accessible as a space. First of all, in terms of the alternative, the absence of these narratives requires increased conservative presence at the expense of liberals. And the reason is that information and access to more views and education, et cetera, often corresponds to adopting more and more left and liberal-leaning views because you've had access to more experiences and views and the different experiences of other people. So that means they actively have to suppress the hiring of quality and intelligent, left-leaning academics. That means more conservatives exist among administrationals, for example. We think this massively increases conflict and the degree to which administration fails to function for university means more white people getting hired, for example. These are all structural problems in the way that universities are set up in their world. That being said, let's do some reputation first. Their first claim is that this dominance looks complete and it is blanketed in the way that it exists. There are a couple of things to note. One, there is diversity within the left itself, that there are varying views and varying extents to which people are left-leaning. And you probably know this because there are probably differences in the types of people, no thank you, that meet on campus and the extent to which they are left-leaning. But also they claim that there is just not a minority of right-wing people is just untrue. It is alive. It does exist at Princeton, for example. We see it all the time. Finally, it is not conducive to these views. I just don't think that it is true that conservatives can't exist. The reason being, for example, even if you are very, very radical, it is very easy to produce something, get tenure, and then begin expressing your radical views, at the very worst case on our side. In terms of opposition to academia, this is just straight scapegoating from their side. It is not true that if it were the case that academia was less left-leaning, that the right-wing would no longer have an incentive because of the oil lobby, for example, to say that climate change isn't happening and we shouldn't suppress that industry. This is just one way that this is happening, but I still think that to the extent that the left is pushing for climate change activism within the Democratic Party, for example, that that impact still materializes. But even in a moderate world, their claim on Biden doesn't work, the reason being that polarization still exists in other spheres of society. So which material gets your attention, for example? Is it the right-wing or the left-wing academia that is expressed on Fox News, for example, and which is expressed on CNN? That suggests that this is just perhaps the diversity of academia being produced at their best, but that doesn't change the way in which those active chambers exist. First argument, no thanks, on why liberalism and progressivism is good. It is true that sometimes the campus left seems to go too far, but broadly we think they are positive. And the reason is, going too far is usually a mischaracterization. It is what Fox News says is happening on campus, but it isn't actually accurate. The reason being that it is usually a set of students that just agree on the way to solve an issue. But more than that, there is a diversity of left policies, which means that there is a moderating effect on campus in terms of the way that people express their views and the way in which that manifests and the extent of protest and student activism. Why then is progressivism good, responding to the criticism from government that we need to improve this? One, it recognizes structural injustice in society, which fundamentally does exist. Things like slavery, for example, the fact that society is deeply unjust and seeking to resolve this is something that is positive. But it is also important because these injustices exist in a way that is critical for universities, right? It recognizes the way that these injustices have affected access to education and to universities. It is important because recognizing those inequities means that you acknowledge that different people have varying degrees of access and that allows for people to realize their privilege and engage in that. Second, I think that the left and the way it exists on campus, no thank you, is self-critical. And the reason is the left-leaning policies and the way that discourse manifests on campus is often about targeting the extent to which privilege exists. People aren't defensive when being confronted with their privilege. The reason being, A, there is humility, but B, because people in positions of power at university become increasingly representative of minorities in a world where it is left-leaning, which means that the people that are telling you that you ought to be acknowledging your privilege are people that you fundamentally respect. That suggests that the types of discourse and academia that is produced on our side is just more representative and acknowledges structural injustice in society, which is important. Second, progressivism convinces society writ large, and this is important. We concede that, as they suggest, there might be some backlash, but broadly speaking, we think that the extent to which left-leaning dominance exists on campus has actually produced a positive trend toward the broader embrace of progressivism and the left. How does this happen? One, I think that increased scrutiny actually shifts the over to the window that exists when talking about campus. The reason being that media continues to report and identify the ways in which the left is protesting on campus, for example, or student activism that occurs. These things, even when they are on the broader, further end of the left spectrum, end up representing views and beginning to normalize them. People find them more and more normal as they go to university, and so these views that are already considered good are things that can slowly be accepted by society. But second, at home, students start talking with their parents. So can conservatism in the house, it means that people in your family, for example, become more sympathetic to these things, and that is better. I'll take closing.

    > POI: What are your reasons as to why you believe that on your side, for some reason, the right or conservative views will dominate?

    I didn't say that. I just said that they exist in campus and that it is bad. Okay, second argument on minorities. The dominance of left-liberal views on campus represents the rise of inclusion on campus. There are a couple of things to note here. First, I think that, broadly speaking, progressivism does target minorities in the types of rhetoric and policies that it promotes. So that is acknowledging societal injustice, for example. It is things like supporting affirmative action. These are things that are critically targeted at minorities that are left out of the majority and the injustice that exists in society. So that suggests, in and of itself, the types of views and the types of policies that are being supported by people on campus are inclusive to a greater degree. But second, I think that, structurally speaking, on average, minorities are more likely to be left-leaning than the average person. The reason being that experiences that they have faced, things like often coming from low-income backgrounds, for example, as a result of societal injustice, means that you are probably more willing and more accepting of things like broader welfare services. This implies two things, for example. One, it means that you get better affirmative action programs and other sets of redistributive policies. This is important because it proves that there are a diversity of perspectives and experiences that are represented in academia. So it is not just academia from the white person, for example, but it is from all sets of society and minorities as well. Second, it suggests that minorities existing in campus is the function or is what enabled dominance in the first place. It is that universities slowly began accepting more and more people of color and that that is why that dominance happened in the first place. So societal trend toward acceptance enabled the dominance of the left to occur in the first place. So regretting this narrative, so regretting their acceptance on campus and their inclusion in these spaces to begin with. On that basis, oppose.

    I want to start by addressing opening opposition's justification for why progressivism is an a priori good. Because we explain, head prime minister, that if you are not convinced of this fact, then dominance is neither strategic for the reasons we explain, nor acceptable in the fact that it drowns out other perspectives and does not provide a healthy balance of perspectives. Their claim is that progressivism is better because it helps minorities, it helps other ranges of oppressed peoples. They claim that since progressivism is a result of diversity, in order to regret the dominance of that progressivism, we need to regret that diversity. But there are four problems with this argument. The first is that they fail to prove why dominance is necessary for people to be protected, for people to develop compassion, for people to develop empathy, for people to engage in other perspectives. And that also explains why their meta trick doesn't function correctly. Because you can still have a diverse campus without liberals or leftists dominating it. Plenty of minorities are conservative. Plenty of minorities are free to experience their own perspectives. And they do not provide real reason to think otherwise. The second problem is they don't explain why conservatism cannot help minorities as well. And we would point out that even if they give you a reason to think progressivism might be preferable to conservatism, the burden they need to meet is that conservatism is not helpful, it is not valuable, or it is so much worse that it is not worth representing on campus. And we explain to you that things like diversity can be valuable in markets. We explain to you that individualism can be a helpful way for oppressed people to raise themselves up, or to hold onto hope, or to organise their ambitions. For this team to explain to you that that level of diversity is not valuable ideologically, they need to do much more to explain that conservatism is not helpful. Thirdly, we point out that there is a diminishing return on dominance of left or liberal views. That is, at the point where the primary debate on campus is between Trotskyists and Leninists, it's unclear that any of that discourse is helpful. We explain to you, as Prime Minister, that in order for leftism to succeed, in order for liberals to be effective at achieving their political ends, they need to not be effective at defeating people more radical or more fringe than them, but effective at explaining to the average person why their views are valuable, why progressivism is helpful. And the current level of dominance does not endow anyone with those skills. There's a diminishing return there. But the final and most important thing I want to add here is that our case also explains to you why, even if you think progressivism is better than conservatism, so much so that it is not worth valuing something like ideological diversity, we not only make that progressivism more effective when campuses are more diverse, but we also make conservatism less toxic. I'm going to move on to the second part of my speech which addresses that, which is the effect on research and the effect on discourse when campuses are more diverse. There are two important mechanisms to note here. The first is that we provide a much broader marketplace of ideas on campuses, which is valuable in and of itself, before analyzing exactly how it works out. That is for three reasons. Firstly, it's for the reason that we force individuals to interrogate their views more closely, which is valuable because it helps them form more precise views, it helps them form well-informed views, it helps them engage more deeply with the arguments that they claim to make. Short question.

    > POI: Conservatism has been dominant in academia for the past 300 to 400 years. What makes you think that's suddenly going to go away under your side?

    Um, conservatism hasn't been valuable for the past 300 to 400 years. Society might have been more conservative, so from the current perspective, it looks like academia was dominated by conservatives, but that's not the same as what you're claiming. We give you reasons to think that a mix of views is a far more likely result, and in fact, the very analysis you're hoping it gives, which explains that campuses have got more diverse from an IGPOL perspective, explains why it's likely to be a mix of views. Secondly, we point out that individuals have to justify their views more in an environment where they're not supported by individuals who have the exact same views as them, and that's a valuable set of skills for individuals to be trained in as part of their education. You're less likely to be required to justify the premises of your ideas, i.e. why diversity is good, or why redistribution is fair, in an environment where those things aren't being challenged. And thirdly, we would just point out that the presence of conservative views can sometimes be valuable for individuals to engage in. That is, as we've talked about at length, notions of individualism, of personal ambition, can be helpful. But secondly, and on top of that, we point out that individuals are forced to communicate those ideas more effectively, and learn skills which are more relevant to them, even politically, going forward. That is, at the moment, university discourse is not at all reflective of what happens in society. Progressives are not tested in their ability to convince the median voter, they're tested in their ability to form a coalition between the Trotskyist on campus and the Leninist. And we point out it's far more valuable, even if we think that progressivism is the only important thing in this debate, to train people, you know, to engage in discourse and argument which is more relevant to society as a whole. Can people still hear me? Okay, that has three impacts in this debate. The first is that right-wing policy and discourse improves as well. That is, when conservatives have a place on campus, they are more likely to base more of their claims in research. That is, under their world, conservatives do not have a place in universities. They are not represented in research. It's hard for them to find factual basis for their claims. And that's what leads to extremism. That's what leads to misinformation. And we explain why those problems are much less likely to happen when they're represented on campus. Secondly, academia is more likely to have a pronounced impact on society. When people are, both students and researchers, are engaging in problems which are more reflective of society, you're more likely to get, like, an actual impact on society. Because people are seeing the views which are relevant to them debated and discussed, not just more fringe, left-wing, and liberal ones. And thirdly, we point out that simply the quality of your education is stronger in an environment where you are forced to engage with a greater degree, like a greater variety of views, and question the premises which you operate on. Even if you're convinced that conservatism is so harmful or so invaluable that it should not be represented on campus very much, we explain to you the reasons that it needs to be there for progressivism to flourish. Some additional rebuttal. The first claim they make to opening opposition base is opposition to climate change would exist anyway in response to the argument we give. But there are three problems with that. Firstly, we point out, no, not everything has a lobby behind it. For instance, research on something like racial disparity might be more likely to fall on people who are listening if there is no, like, kind of politicization. Secondly, we point out that you're less likely to have denialism in the first place, and conservatism isn't forced to completely ditch universities and ignore them, you know, wholesale, which is what we explained to Prime Minister. And finally, we point out the capacity to ditch universities, to characterize them as extremists, is much less in an environment where universities are not seen as the sole domain of leftism or liberalism. So even if the incentive exists, it's much less likely to happen. The only other meaningful claim they make is diversity within the left exists, and conservatives exist. Firstly, diversity within the left isn't always useful. They operate on the same premises. Second, conservatives are often marginalized, because the left tends to oppose trade-offs. And thirdly, we point out it's about perception. The thing we explained to you at Prime Minister is universities are marginalized when they're deceived to be dominated by the left and liberals. Even if they avoid that reality, that perception is still terminal for their case. For those reasons, we have to go.

    Being misgendered or being forced to use a bathroom that doesn't match your gender identity ruins your day and makes it impossible for you to go to classes. It destroys your confidence and your quality of life. The reason why dominance is necessary is because pre-existing social structures crush minorities and make it impossible to access the privileges that university confers upon us. At today's university, 9% of the student body is Hispanic, despite them constituting 30% of the population of the surrounding city of New Orleans. At Princeton, the percentage of black students in the university sits below 15%, despite the fact that they make up about 30% of the population of New Jersey. The issue is, on their side, that there is no correction for the systemic class injustices that exist in society today. We are willing to trade off benefits to discourse or to academia, as long as right here, right now, formal students in universities are currently feeding a press who would, on their side, feel like they do not have a place in these halls of prestige, feel like they can have a home here, and as long as we can make sure that we increase social mobility by helping them access this. Three clashes in today's debate. The first thing I want to do is talk about the quality of discourse, because that's the majority of the advocacy from side 00. Their claim here is that it becomes impossible to challenge views because there's no challenge to your views. It then means that children do not learn how to justify their opinions, and this makes them less persuasive. Their analysis is not actually unique to universities, but rather to echo chambers in general, and I think that this idea that people all around have the same opinion is way more true and more a function of geographic and demographic functions than anything else. If I go to a school in Manhattan, for example, and I'm surrounded by other children who are from suburban neighborhoods with WASP parents, then it's the case that I will have some degrees from them because my parents will be the same gaze, because I've used the same social media, because I looked at the same influencers, or because I just experienced the same kind of economic circumstances and priorities in my life. The issue then is that they have people who come from this position of ideological gridlock already, and universities are way, way, way better for this for two reasons. One, because kids come from all sorts of different backgrounds and disagree on issues intrinsically. It's absurd for them to say that liberalism is all exactly the same because they're just cherry-picking examples to say that liberalism is all about intellectual, and liberalism is all about theories. For example, Marxists and Leninists and Trotskyists. The average STEM kid does not know who Lenin is. They do not understand the difference between Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky. I think this is not the case. The priority that is placed by leftist universities is rather on issues of social justice and class and race. Before I go any further, I'll take a closing.

    > POI: Yeah, so far you've been talking about things that liberal judges like, like progressivism and stuff like that. Why don't you talk about the communist idea, socialist idea, and these type of things that are also propagated in universities that are dangerous for people?

    So, the 20 seconds I had just said explain why liberalism in universities focuses on ideas of social justice as opposed to these intellectual ideas. The second thing I want to say, though, is that it's also misleading for them to say that conservatism is all about individualism and that this is mutually exclusive, the brand of leftism that exists on campus. Very simply because it is true that this appeals to people and they don't associate it with conservatism to such a large extent. So, as I was saying, people come from all walks of life and their upbringing and their religion and their parents influences their opinion more than the university does. Over the course of your time at school, you talk to each other and you come to a consensus to a large extent where you become persuaded on some issues. It's disingenuous for them to say that because people agree that you don't therefore diverge across your opinions, very simply because the point of education is to understand why the things you're doing are true. Like, if a professor just shoves CRT down your throat and tells you this is objective truth without explaining why, the class gets like three-star reviews and no one comes back again. People want to understand why. People want to understand the different objective, the different perspective, and this has just become a fundamental truth of academia and a fundamental of teaching in the classroom. So, for those reasons, I think that transferring liberalism from something that exists exclusively in social media among young people in wealthy communities to something that exists in academia means that discourse and justification is better, not worse. The second clash I have to talk about then is on polarization and social progress because they say that the harm is that there's a demonization of universities that de-legitimizes academia. So, I just want to call bullshit on this issue because the idea that people, that right-wingers all see universities as dens of corruption that are dominated by the left is incredibly extreme. First of all, because honestly, academics intrinsically have a ton of authority. Jordan Peterson is called a professor because everyone has a respect for academia. But second of all, it's also the case that this narrative runs counter to the majority of right-wingers, especially people in positions of influence. It might exist for some extremists, but the average person still perceives university as a source of prestige and social mobility. Like, you will know someone in your family who went to school, and that will be an achievement which you celebrate, not which you condemn because their income is higher afterwards. But also, the majority of politicians went to university. The impact of this, then, is that the narrative of rejection of liberalism in university does not look like a wholesale rejection of academia, but rather a claim that the rise of liberalism in universities is bad, and that there's, like, shit just being perpetuated by it. Therefore, there is no rejection of objective truth such as climate change is happening as a result of this trend, and the condemnation of universities as a perpetrator of harmful abuse is something that would exist on either side of the house. So, OO gets no offensive advocacy on the idea of polarisation. Finally, then, on why it's the case that dominance of liberal abuse is necessary for protecting students on campus, for two reasons. The first thing is, liberalism and progressivism, and making sure that people feel included, does not require 50% in order for things to pass. It requires an absolute majority because it requires you to change structures that already exist in school. And more aggressive affirmative action programs, for example, mean that awarded trustees or people who, like, analyse children, are less able to get into schools. You must be able to defeat their interests in order to achieve these action policies. But second of all, because it only takes 20% of the student body, or 40% more, in order to make someone feel unwelcome. For example, if it's the case that conservatives feel like it is just very, very easy to criticise someone for being transgender, then transgender kids cannot attend school. For these reasons, very happy to embrace liberalism.

    As a right-wing debater who spent six years debating with all of you, running all of these stupid socialist cases, I am incredibly proud to propose this motion. What we will prove to you in extension is that this necessarily polarises societies and makes left-wingers more far-left, supporting things like communist policies, belittling madmen like Bernie Sanders, and the right-wing to become even more radicalised in this particular case. We will also frame you, why this is necessarily more balanced in our psych house, with better reasons than opening government, but that in the end. Why does polarisation happen? Notice there are two groups of people here. On the first extension, people who do not have predisposed beliefs. Why are these groups of people very likely? When people go into universities, they're usually newcomers, so they didn't have much experience communicating with people, they didn't necessarily think that much about politics, their brains are usually low. But secondly, professors have authority bias towards them because of their titles, because they're rhetorically persuasive, because they can control discussions and pick and choose what particular things to talk about, similar to how persuasive a debater can pick and choose evidence to talk in this particular case. So they're likely to skew this sort of thing. The bottom line is, they're specifically susceptible to being brainwashed by this sort of thing. Notice this four-year process, where these students go into these particular things and are taught about these theories, and are taught about this sort of thing, and the discussion is likely to be limited. I will analyse this a bit later, because it's a right compassion at all, but just to get the impact in. These people, after going through this process, are likely to support things like high taxes, likely to support things like radical distribution, socialism, all of these particular things, etc. And they have to defend these policies of these particular views, because their inherent spectrum of left and liberalism do not get them to get away with this. These things are bad, because they're counter to the actual things that they care about, because they stop jobs from coming in in this particular case, because they create corruption in these sorts of cases, and lazy people who exist on welfare in this sort of case. No, no, no. The nuances, to a certain extent, we can support this, but not to the full crazy extent as they talk about on their side of the house. The response we hear is, there is a diversity of political opinions and liberal opinions. I call bullshit on this particular thing, for four structural reasons. Firstly, they do not doubt fundamentals of liberalism in this particular case, like socialism is always good, like abortion being always good, even though abortion is a fairly debatable issue in our society, and in fact could be an argument that you're killing people. But secondly, they collectively agree that the other side is bad. That low taxes are always necessarily bad, and that guns should always be banned, and people who own guns should be in this particular case. And you know how this is annoying? Sometimes they make jokes about this particular thing. Ah, we're not like a redneck from Alabama or something like that in this particular case, etc. But let's give more structural reasons to this. First, you're likely to virtue-signal during the discussions in order to obviously signal that you are liberal in this particular case. This process is both a process to a professor or to a student, because you want your students to like you, and because you want to show them that you are most liberal in this particular case. You are, obviously, the favorite one who supports the actualists, but also student to professor. So, because students have an incentive to basically say, what was the word first? If the professors ask, I'm sorry, myself, they necessarily would want to say that yes, they support this particular area, or yes, liberalism is good, or yes, abortion should always be legal in this particular case. But you know what's the second thing? There is no voice to counter these opinions, because you feel ashamed to say that you're right-wing, because you feel ashamed to do this. Similar to how right-wing debaters feel ashamed to wrong-write in this particular case. So there is no counter-gallancy mechanism towards this. It always aggregates to the farthest edges of these particular cases. The bottom line is that you have a total amount of population brainwashed into these crazy ideas. They do not have counter-voices in their head when these people go out. They vote for crazy people like Bernie Sanders. They vote for people who will back up your country and do these particular things, which causes instability. But what happens to the right-wingers? And this is the important thing. And let's directly compare with the opening government. Their mechanism is top-down, as to what the politicians will say based on this argument. But I have no idea if I'm receiving money from oil companies, why I won't deny climate change in any way, why I won't destroy a thing in this particular case. I will split the bottom up. I will split up the process of what right-wing students go through in this particular case. Firstly, you feel ashamed for speaking out your opinions as if you can't speak in this particular case. You feel anger in this particular one because you feel silenced. Because your personal identity is being attacked as someone who believes in this sort of thing. This is a grueling process that takes four years in your university where you have to go every day and you have to do this. But second, you feel ashamed that you can't be who you are. You feel ashamed for believing that maybe a portion is wrong in this particular case. That something is wrong with you that you believe that you should be able to carry on in this particular case. That you cannot speak out freely. That you cannot argue with your professor. But this is the third thing. You have a horrible experience in your universities because you will not go talk to your professor after class in this particular case because you feel like you won't do this sort of thing. Because your professor actively controls your brains and has active strongman mechanisms to break you in this particular case. And when they go out of university they are likely to feel bad. Even if they could be sensible people. To be more susceptible to writing rhetoric. To find more appeal and more closure into this particular case. And to demonize the other side. To say, yes, you are smart, please. I've been to university. But this process also impacts other writing people who you talk to who didn't necessarily go to this university and perpetuate the stereotype that these are left in this particular case. So these people get further to the right. Supporting things like no abortion laws whatsoever. Total gun control. And you have what situation is America in this particular case. Before I get to call this better on our side of the house. Yeah.

    > POI: These people are the same people who tell me I am a mentally ill sexual predator because I am transgender.

    No, no, no. This is the nuance here. Let's be honest here. Right-wingers are not all pricks but you make them crazy on their side of the house. This is the important thing. Now, why is this better? I'll prove balance in a second. You have more discussion in this particular case which leads to contact theory. You are less likely to demonize the other side and to think they are genuine when they are all freely openly talking about this particular case and you can do a story. And this means this discussion cannot be perfect but it's a basic way for these left-wingers and right-wingers to agree on common facts in this particular case and to not be susceptible to this rhetoric once they get out of university. Why is this a likely characterization? Such a civil rights movement in the United States they have it irrespective of academia such as for example rise of middle class people getting rich in this particular case being when you are rich or middle class you are less susceptible to rationalist rhetoric or how do you say us versus them devices in this particular case so you are not likely to be transphobic, racist in all these particular cases you are probabilistically less likely without these particular things but also it's like technology lowers the amount of religion that exists in our society. I know this doesn't flip them but it proves to you that to a sufficient extent you will be able to gain most of your protections from minorities but do you know what minorities won't be protected when Donald Trump is in power because he radicalized the right to this extent and after that you get a socialist Bernie Sanders in this particular case. I have never been prouder to propose.

    In the Philippines the horrific reign of the Marcos regime was only toppled because universities were brave because universities were courageous enough to be left wing to be liberal to dominate and to construct a lot of the horrible conservative ideologies that existed in the very first place in Hong Kong the umbrella movement and the protest against the extradition bill only existed because universities were a liberal hub for people to be able to critique not only the regime of China but the regime of accountability the regime of people that were constantly in power and had already benefited from conservatism in the very first place the extension coming from closing opposition will be very simple we think that even the most extreme versions of liberalism the most extreme versions of progressivism only improve, only become a representative of the realities of society because universities allowed them to be and universities allowed them to be dominant and secondly because this is what bleeds into protest movements that improve society address societal inequality and keep our powers in check and keep them afraid of the youth two extensions coming from closing opposition first, why is it that the most extreme form of liberal values only exist in the dominance of liberalism within these universities and why do they improve and secondly why is this bleeding to protest movements that ensures our societies are not only equitable but constantly improved let's go to the first extension why are liberal values when dominant continuously improve only in universities the problem with the government bench push is that they only said that liberalism is not inherently good and closing government gave a really wacko jacko extension of Bernie Sanders bad and everybody will vote for Bernie Sanders but notice that opening opposition shied away from this burden they were afraid of taking on the burden that a lot of these extreme values can be beneficial for society and only got the low hanging fruit of minorities we're going to give you the story that the notions of socialism and radical redistribution are only checked and balanced and only improved in universities because of the pressure of the academia because of the pressure of legitimacy why do these ideologies grow within universities and why are they constantly evolving, one, we think we're going to spend a lot of time opening government mechanisms because of the pressure to be well founded the pressure to have academically rigorous research, the pressure to be able to be published and to ensure that your classes are not only fair but are more critical and more accurate representation to society that's why we're more likely to generate things such as what is a fair tax what is an equitable immigration policy what is an equitable form of policing that is necessary to guarantee the security of society while also minimizing the prejudice against racial minorities in the very first place, but secondly we think that it is the dominance of liberalism that allows the proposition of these ideas not only by professors in the academia but by students, by people that are outside of the school, that want to be researched and that want to prepare up and want to partner up with a lot of these universities that's how we constantly improve a lot of the radical policies that ensure that not only minorities get benefited with opening opposition only wanted but the general society, but the general notion of society and the lowest common denominator person, because liberalism is not just about diversity, it is about benefiting the most amount of people while hurting the least amount of people in the very first place this is how our ideas evolve, this is how they get turned into classes, this is how they get turned into research that ensures that they're actually practical and implementable within society and not just airy-fairy notions of philosophy that people debate over in prestigious competitions such as this. Thirdly, I think a lot of the pluralism that only exists on our side allows us to speak up against the structures of authority that's how we are able to speak up against professors contrary to what closing government says notice that a lot of professors who teach things like government, political philosophy and economics tend to learn from their students, and that only happens in society or a liberal-dominated value system, because that understands that every value system, every opinion is equal and more importantly legitimate. That's why students not only feel more empowered on our side, like what opening opposition said, but secondly, a lot of their ideas are implemented into policy implemented into discussion, and that's why it's incredibly good. That's how we beat government bench, even if it is true that liberalism is not inherently good, even if it's true that it sometimes leads to bad policies. It is only corrected, it is only improved, it is only well researched on our side, where there's the courage to stand up to be liberal, the courage to say that maybe we should back the rich more maybe we should let more immigrants in even if there might be some increase in power in the very first place. But more importantly, we beat opening opposition because we don't shy away from the burden and show that sometimes the most extreme versions of liberalism are good, but they're only good if they're checked and balanced within these institutions Let's go to the second example. Before I move on, sure, opening.

    > POI: Both sides have a faction of socialists that can go out and protest or advocate, don't the outside that equips that faction with the skills to justify their beliefs and speak to the average reasonable person?

    No, you have to justify your beliefs on our side, you have to be able to speak to the average reasonable person, because I believe in university everyone is taught how to write, everyone is taught how to communicate, everyone is forced to do those cringy presentations to the most reasonable or the lowest common denominator person. Let's go to the second extension. Why do universities lead to crucial protest movements that help improve society regardless of their political ideas? Opening government's argument here is that we need a broad marketplace of ideas and we need well-founded facts. And opening opposition's clash in this is a little bit weird, because they said that we want to focus on structural injustices and somehow universities' diversity somehow fixes that. We're going to argue that the combination of dominance of liberalism of universities and the existence of these universities provides the necessary conditions for a lot of these protest movements. Why is this the case? One, on either side of the house, the conservative elite, the conservatives that run Fox News, that campaign that climate change is not real, that fund corporations like Shell to be able to enrich themselves, still go to these universities. What that then means is that A, we get their valid opinion on a lot of the discussions that exist, because often times these are people of privilege, that are not just not afraid to speak out, but incredibly proud of their opinion. But it is only the dominance of this liberal movement that allows an equal and fair discussion between a person at this point of the Princeton Democrats and a person that is funded by a lot of conservative politicians in the very first place. But secondly, this is where we actually get the contact theory, because this is only the instances where a lot of people can collectivize, join organizations such as the debate, join organizations such as, for example, minority group movements, that not only fund communities, but start protest movements that spread out into society. That's where we start protest movements that are A, harder to crack down, because the conservative politicians in these regimes do not want to crack down into schools of their children, but B, more importantly, have all of the legitimacy, because it is harder for conservatives to critique the top universities in the world if their own children are in it in the very first place. That is why we get more effective protest movements, more legitimate protest movements. Even if all government says that this is somehow misconstrued as elitist, it is fine, because this elitism is what grants them the freedom to say that I have well-founded facts, that my protest movement is legitimate, my protest movement is well-founded on research and all of the like, and that's how more people join into these things. Universities start the protest movements that change society. Universities start the protest movements that ensure that we can hold the most powerful individuals accountable, irregardless of their political views. For all these reasons and more, the motion forms.

    So, when I go into the debate round, unless there is judges here, most of the time what I do is I tell all the liberal bullshit that you want me to hear, and I got a pretty good idea to get to the Open Semifinals without actually believing most of the things that I've been saying to you all of this time. Why is this important? It is important because it's the exact same mechanism that occurs in these university lectures, in these activism groups, in these particular conversations. So, you see, because I want to get into that diversity, I start faking and hiding my actual particular political views, because I know the admission commission is not going to let me in if I say something conservative, because they don't care about these things, because nobody pushes for these particular opinions to be represented in the lecture for you to have all political views and things like that. So, when I go into universities, if I believe those particular things, or even if, let's say, I don't believe them, but I would like to become part of the Republican Party someday because I get a lot of influence and things like that, and the Republican Party is powerful on both sides of the house, basically, I just don't engage with you. I don't talk about my actual opinions. What does that mean? It means that you don't get to hear my actual opinion and engage with the platform, but it also means that there is no actual things like that. So, I lose the ability to actually, like, when I'm in university, maybe go to that different lecture that is a little bit left-wing, and actually hear their opinions, because I know that the minute I walk in, my different opinion is never going to be even acknowledged. Nobody's even going to talk about it. Why is this important? Because I lose the opportunity to hear people's stories of, like, engaged people from minority groups and things like that, that actually have structural problems. Especially if, like, look, and this is important, because these educated conservatives on our side of the house are the only people who can actively change how the conservatism in the future is viewed. And actually make sure that on both sides of the house, we accept at least the same facts, so we can work on from there. So, if I never engage with people that give me more reasons to believe, and actually believe that it's important for me to protect climate change, or it's important to have some minority rights, or some minority votes in universities and stuff, it's much, much less likely for me to do those things when I actually become a politician, but not also a politician. Any person in power in society. Because, look, people who go out of these universities, like Harvard, Princeton, and things like that, these are the people who are going to become the next CEOs, the next media hosts, the next people with, like, disproportionate power in society to change opinions, because they are pretty, they are very well educated, they know how to say the beautiful words, they're EPL, and they have huge persuasion to them, which is extremely important. And they can use that persuasion, sometimes for the good sides, but let me tell you how they get out of this place. I even believe some of them are conservatives as well. They're going to go to their company, because they have been feeling like an outcast, and somebody that their opinions were rejected all of these times are likely going to be more radicalized, and say these people don't deserve anything. Because every person that advocates for, like, let's say African-American rights or things like that is radical. They don't see the middle point, so let's not engage with them at all. Let's paint them as somebody who we don't care about. Let's not cater to these people as a political party. Let's diminish them, demonize their opinions and things like that much more, and these are the people in control. Or if you're a CEO, let them get a job in the first place. And then a lot of these things. I think this on its own deals with a lot of what's coming from opposing opposition in terms of what is actually going to be the opinions of that. Liberalism and the dominance of something definitely doesn't mean that all these other opinions that still exist in the media are completely educated. Otherwise, what you have had in the last 20 years is more and more people that are younger are less or more conservative. But I think it's still 50-50 to a lot of degrees, especially if we see conservative people actually rising to power. So I think the important thing is to actually make sure that at least we agree on the basic stuff. How does this look like? I think it's basically like, look, maybe, in the short term, we'll have less of the most inclusive policies, like bathrooms and things like that. But, look, we don't have these things in society. If you go to Alabama, if you go to a lot of European places, you don't have gender minorities bathrooms. This is the problem. The only way to achieve a lot of the things that we have on their side of the house is good liberal policies, or at least some of them. Like, we all agree that climate change is an issue on both sides. Some of the usual things that they've done. Or we agree that minimum wage is important for poverty groups. Or even in reverse, we agree that sometimes overspending is bad. Sometimes stimulus checks are better over stimulus. On both sides of the house, in order to achieve some middle ground, where more people are actually benefiting and at least the most radical versions of radical opinions are removed, is when we get this particular change in society through actually making sure that both sides of the house are engaged with these particular things. They know what the other side is talking about. It's less likely for them to demonize it, especially in the future, especially the people who have the most say and power in these particular institutions. Before we continue, opening.

    > POI: So you and Ruben are pretty big brain, or able to maintain eccentric beliefs. But isn't that brainwashing mech that Ruben's extension is about more effective than discourse when it comes to impersonating the average person?

    Look, the problem is that you don't have better discourse on your side of the house. I'm telling you there is a mechanism where this gets better on some particular issues. I think that's overall better because more people are this. If the fucking Republicans agree that climate change actually exists, at least we can have some type of policies that accommodate to a certain extent. We limit fracking to a certain extent even if we don't completely remove it, which is much better than what is happening currently on your side of the house. I think a lot of the inclusivity things that come from them are directly reported by Ruben. I think of social movements, the last thing that I'm going to say is that social movements need to engage people of both political spectrums in order to achieve the critical mass that they need to make active changes in society, which we only get on our side of the house if you don't demonize the other side because you've been an outcast your whole time. I think finally all of this, a lot of good pushes as to why people are still going to go to universities. We explained to you that they will and the problem is not that they're going to completely distrust the data and things that we do like that, but it's more about the mechanism of how we actually achieve them believing and engaging with probable things on the other side of the house, which is far more likely because I don't think people are going to distrust actual data information, but they are far more likely to accept it and talk about it to their political constituencies, which is what we need in this round. Very fucking happy to stand for all the conservative debaters out there.

    Every other team in this round is debating on the margins. Even on either side of the world, there's probably going to be some level of polarization. There's still going to be some level of discussion between different parties. There's still going to be some level of research. I don't think any team in this round actually proves what the margin of their change is. And on closing opposition, we're here to say that we're here to talk about what specifically is unique about colleges and I think it is the ability to push protest movements forward. I think that puts us above most other teams in the round. Not only because it is something that is unique to what is specific about colleges, but also because of the fact that the margin of change is so large. That is when social movements are successful, when protest movements are successful, it doesn't change just the people who are engaged in that particular discourse. It makes the world a better place for every single person. We think that's the meaningful difference in the round. I want to talk about why protest movements are important and why closing government's response is insufficient. I think there are two broad maybe implicit responses coming from closing government. Closing government first makes the claim, why do you actually need dominance of liberalism in order to push forward these protest movements? The reason is very simple. In order for protest movements to be successful, you require two things. The first is, you need to cross a particular threshold of attention. Obviously, if more individuals are engaged in that protest movement, that means that it's more likely to cross the threshold such that the protest movement gets traction in the first place. Secondly, the reason why protest movements are oftentimes unsuccessful is because you do not necessarily have the resources, you do not have the same backing within it, and that necessarily means that universities are a necessary way of doing so. Another possible criticism from closing government, which they actually didn't say, but I'm just going to build one for them, is closing government may make the argument that says, oh, but what if these movements fail? Our claim is that failure is oftentimes inherent to protest movements, but over time they become more successful. In the instances in which they do become successful, we think it makes the society a better place. I don't think anyone in this room would dispute the fact that Chinese dominance within Hong Kong is a good thing. I don't think anyone would dispute the fact that things like the oppression or corrupt government is a bad thing. We think that those are the things that people are more likely to coalesce over, and that necessarily means that you need universities to be able to do this, and Mattie gave you the evidence as to why that is the case. I've only given you the way as to why that is round winning. I want to then talk about the rest of the round now. But before I go on, I'll take opening.

    > POI: Our material explains that left and liberal dominance means mistrust of universities, conservative misinformation in response, which is the reason why your protests are by and large ineffective.

    I think Mattie gave you the response that says that mistrust cannot happen as much as any other organization. It is much easier to mistrust a climate change organization as opposed to the very colleges that literally people like Trump and literally anyone who's in power went to, so I don't think this argument has a lot of weight in the round anymore. I'm going to then respond to closing government. The first thing I want to note on closing government is I think their case is very interesting. Closing government makes a claim that says the vast majority of people who come from privileged institutions like colleges are eventually going to gain a lot of power, but at the same time they make the claim that people are oftentimes coming in with a blank slate. If this claim is true, we would rather these people be brainwashed such that they support things that are better for society because in the absence of that, they are only going to enrich their own wealth. If 80% of the people at Harvard are on the left and they tend to become more powerful within society, we absolutely support that. Secondly, I think closing government is actually not explaining why liberal policies are bad. They just say higher taxes create unemployment, like literally why? They don't actually explain why that is the case. I actually want to give you some reasons as to why their claims are actually economic bullshit. The first is that I think governments are oftentimes better at using money than corporations because the money that is used by governments take into account the aggregation of preferences of all individuals as opposed to just the shareholders, which necessarily means that it's better for society. Secondly, they say radical redistribution is bad. I don't know if they've heard about the concept of decreasing marginal utility, but even if they have some beliefs that say, oh, some people use money really poorly, the $500 that goes to someone who's really poor is far more impactful than the $500 that goes to someone who's really rich. So they needed to prove why leftist policies are bad. I don't think they've done that in the round. Thirdly, their argument on brainwashing necessarily cuts both ways because if you look at their mechanisms, there's power dynamics between professors and students. You guys also have power dynamics between professors and students. They make claims that say you're going to listen to the loudest student. You're also going to listen to the loudest student, which on your side is probably going to be the white, privileged, rich man who's at one of these institutions. I don't think they've proved the margin of their argument. What then is the difference in the round, though? I think what Biden tells you is that liberalism fundamentally relies on an acceptance of other ideas, that there is pluralism, whereas conservatism doesn't necessarily do that. Because in order to push for some kind of change in society, you need to be accepting of the fact that there are diverse ways to change society, and pluralism necessarily is the basis for liberalism. That means that professors and other students are going to be more accepting of other people's ideas. We actually flip a lot of their impasses. The final thing that they say is that right-wing people are going to go crazy, and they're going to do really weird things. The problem is, one, this is intentional with their own argument that just those people enter with a blank slate, so it's unclear how many people are going to go this much crazier. But secondly, if their claim is if you tell individuals anything with an academic basis, people are not going to believe you anymore. Presumably, you're still going to have academic research, you're still going to have people trying to convince other people of their ideas. And hence, their argument doesn't stand. This is an argument against having any kind of interaction between people with different political ideologies. I say it's bullshit. Finally, let's talk about opening government. I think opening government unfortunately does not have much left standing in the round. Opening government's main push is the idea that there's going to be an opposition to academia. One, Maddie's exception beat this material very directly. But secondly, even if this argument is true, as every other team in the round has successfully recognized, the margin is very, very small. It's unclear why other radical movements will not be the reason as to why the left is criticized. It's unclear why other forms of research is the reason why the left won't be criticized. Finally, opening government talks a lot about research and why people are just going to propagate their ideas without any kind of reason. I don't think they've actually read any economics papers. Even those that are read richly by leftist individuals have very good research, have very good data, have very good standing. I don't think they deal with the reality that we are living. Ultimately, this debate is a question about how much change universities have the power to create in society. We say that it is only on closing opposition that you can create active change in the world that destroys the kinds of oppressive structures that people live under. We're extremely proud to stand on closing opposition.

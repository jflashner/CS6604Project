  During the recent economic crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has provided certain conditions to developing countries for receiving loans. These conditions require governments to adopt more market based economic policies. Targets include reducing government budget deficits and increasing international currency reserves. The policy conditions provided by the IMF include 1) reducing or eliminating fuel subsidies and fertiliser subsidies; 2) setting the currency exchange rate to international market rates; 3) implementing market-based interest rates; 4) anti corruption provisions.

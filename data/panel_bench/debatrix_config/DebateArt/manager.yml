      judge_debate: Please summarize the use of arguments of each debater in the debate and compare them. This includes what arguments are made, whether they are on topic and sound, whether their backing premises and logic are clear and reasonable, whether they are supported by credible evidence, whether the language is appropriate, and whether the counterarguments provide effective refutation against the opponent or fail to respond to some arguments from the opponent. Also analyze the relative strength between each debater's argument sets, and their impacts against each other, by analyzing the clashes between both side's argument sets, comparing the relative strength between sides critically and logically. Award the debater that, within the context of the debate, affirms (for pro) or negates (for con) the resolution the best.
      analyze_speech: Please provide references of the use of arguments in the new speech. This includes what arguments are made, whether they are on topic and sound, whether their backing premises and logic are clear and reasonable, whether they are supported by credible evidence, and whether the language is appropriate.
      use_previous: To clarify arguments already made in the debate, you should refer to previous speeches; you need to report whether the counterarguments provide effective refutation against the opponent, or whether it fails to respond to some arguments from the opponent. In addition, analyze the clashes between both side's argument sets; for each clash, think critically and logically to compare the relative strength between sides.
      judge_by_analysis: First, for each debater, summarize their use of arguments in ALL their debates, according to the given argument analyses. Next, analyze the relative strength between each debater's argument sets, and their impacts against each other; also analyze the clashes between both side's argument sets, comparing the relative strength between sides critically and logically. Award the debater that, within the context of the debate, affirms (for pro) or negates (for con) the resolution the best.

    prompt:
      judge_debate: Please summarize the use of sources of each debater in the debate and compare them. This includes what relevant outside evidence is used, and how they are used to support the arguments. If all of the debaters do their research due diligence, or the quantity difference of external sources is not large (even if one debater uses one external sources while another uses none), they are tied; otherwise, award the debater that, with a strong quality lead, better supports their side's case with external sources. Note that unreliable sources, if enough to diminish their own case, should receive a penalty.
      analyze_speech: Please provide references of the use of sources in the new speech. This includes what outside evidence is used, whether their sources are credible, and how they are used to support the arguments. Note that sources providing common knowledge or are the subject of the debate DO NOT count as a valid external source; you should think critically and analyze the references to EXCLUDE such sources. Lack of evidence, evidence with unreliable sources, or source spam without relevant analysis should be reported; however, if the arguments can firmly be based on common knowledge without actually needing extra sources, the speech should not be criticized as lacking evidence.
      use_previous: To clarify quotes across speeches, especially the ones related to previous sources from either side, you should refer to previous speeches; you need to distinguish these quotes from normal sections.
      judge_by_analysis: First, for each debater, summarize their use of sources in ALL their speeches, according to the given source analyses. Next, compare the use of sources between debaters. If all of the debaters do their research due diligence, or the quantity difference of external sources is not large (even if one debater uses one external sources while another uses none), they are tied; otherwise, award the debater that, with a strong quality lead, better supports their side's case with external sources.

    prompt:
      judge_debate: Please summarize the use of language of each debater in the debate. This includes sections that affects the clarity level and the conduct level. Informal language and/or aggressive tone are allowed to attract the audience; do not punish the debater because of such language use. However, extremely illegible paragraphs and extremely unsportsmanlike or outright toxic behaviors like repeated personal insults should receive a penalty. Finally, if one debater deserves a penalty, award the other one (unless all debaters are penalized); otherwise announce that they are tied.

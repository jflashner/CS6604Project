                "content": "**Pro's theory is unfalsifiable**\n\nPro is making a claim that is impossible to prove. She is claiming that people always act to maximize their satisfaction. If they act against their own interests (in terms of satisfaction) it can only be through ignorance. If they knew better, they would act better.\n\nIt is easy to recall examples of people acting in ways contrary to their own satisfaction. They give in to addictions, cravings. They procrastinate. They are lazy - they don't exercise even though being fit would make them happier. I say they, but I mean we, of course. We all do it.\n\nThere are examples the other way - people behaving against their own self interest to help others, the rescue people, to care for people. People can even hurt, exhaust or impoverish themselves for others. We've all seen that too.\n\nI hope you will excuse me anticipating Pro's argument here. I do so because this argument already exists in utility theory and the theory of intrinsic motivation. That is, people may not realise or express their true motivation. You may say that it doesn't make you feel good to give up to your job to care for your sick mother, but at some level it must, otherwise why would you do it? Similarly, at some level you must prefer to watch TV now rather than go for a run. Otherwise, you wouldn't make that choice.\n\nThis theory is unfalsifiable. Worse, it assumes two things from one piece of information. The only information we have is the action. From it, we assume both the action and the motivation.\n\nNo, to prove Pro's theory we need two pieces of information. We need the action and something else. That could be the expressed feeling of satisfaction, but as we know, people do not act to maximise this in all cases. Or it could be something else.\n\n**Why do we need a theory of satisfaction/motivation?**\n\nHumans evolved from simpler animals. These animals did not have goals and satisfactions, they simply responded to their environment. Action came first. It was only many thousands of years later that there were animals with central nervous systems capable of experiencing something like satisfaction. Therefore, satisfaction is not necessary to explain action.\n\nNevertheless, humans are obsessed with trying to explain action in these terms. Even evolutionary scientists talk about the \"goal\" of particular actions that animals or plants make, or of evolution itself. Often they will make a friendly comment in the introduction explaining that of course evolution doesn't have a purpose, and we can't assume purpose in relation to plants or animals. However, once this has been stated, they go on to talk as if you can assume purpose. They use that language.\n\nWhat would happen if we didn't make that assumption though? What if people didn't watch TV to maximize satisfaction, but rather the action just existed without purpose?\n\n**Coordination**\n\nIn order for humans to coordinate, they need to talk in terms of purpose, especially shared purpose. As Pro described, in the work place, it is a straightforward matter to decide whether an action furthers the organisation's goals or not. However, not all human action is coordinated. When an individual is not at work, or not working in a voluntary group, they do not have formal goals any more.\\\n**Summary**\\\nThere is no reason to suppose that humans always act to maximise their own satisfaction.\n"

In order to maximize her evolutionary fitness, any woman in a wealthy family would try to have as many children as possible, given that the family could support all of them. Women are physically capable of having at least 12 children in a lifetime, and yet very few wealthy women choose this path. This is not because they are uneducated in the basics of genetics and evolution. They are aware that not having children, or having few children, will limit their evolutionary fitness. They simply don't care.\n\nAlternately, consider the case of a childless couple in their 60s or 70s. It is too late for this couple to reproduce and there is absolutely nothing they can do to enhance their evolutionary fitness. Yet, they continue to act. They continue to make decisions.\n\nPro has shifted the argument from being about satisfaction to being about evolutionary fitness, thereby weakening her position. Humans often act against their own evolutionary fitness, even when fully aware of the alternatives. Further, many actions that humans take have demonstrably no effect on their evolutionary fitness, and yet those actions continue to be made.\n"

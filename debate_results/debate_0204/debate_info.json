What they're doing is not the right way to deal with this \"problem\".\\\n   (by \"problem\" I mean that I don't think there is a problem)3.Racial equality already exists in this country.\n\nPoint #1: **The Colin Kaepernick movement is founded in a blanket statement.**\n\nThe blanket statement that the movement is founded in is this: The police are racist.\n\nMy argument is simple. Not ALL police are racist. In fact, I think the vast vast majority aren't. That statement is very unfair. That's like saying, \"everyone who lives in Green Bay is a cheese head.\" Which isn't true. There is at least one person in Green Bay who isn't a cheese head, so it is unfair to categorize them as such.\\\nAnd doing things such as making socks with pigs in police hats on them is just flat-out wrong and I think it is ridiculous that anyone would do that. I think it's fair to say that per capita, there are just as many racist black people as white people. I think it's foolish to say that the only racist race is whites.\n\nPoint #2: **What they're doing is not the right way to deal with this \"problem\".**\n\nThings like profiling police officers as all being racist and making pig police socks to pigeonhole the police is wrong as well. I think that two wrongs don't make a right and to do that because of so called inequality in a country where no laws exist that discriminate is downright ignorant.\n\nPoint #3: **Racial equality already exists in this country.**\n\nName to me one law, one legislation that discriminates against blacks or any minority for that matter. In fact, most policies in place by employers and colleges look to give minorities a better chance at being enrolled in a college or hired at a job. Just because a group of people was discriminated in the past does not mean things are unequal now.\n\nI appreciate my opponent's acceptance and the opportunity to debate on this topic. Rebuttals next round. Good luck!\n"

Thank you I guess.\n\nI don't care about what's in someone's head as much as what they do. There's not a way to scientifically study something such as implicit bias, so we're swinging at ghosts effectively. Also, implicit bias isn't solid enough to hold up in a court room which is why it's never been used in a courtroom as evidence for any case. I don't care about what people think in their head so much as if they act on it because I'm not a mind reader.\n\nTo your source, how would they know that???It still doesn't explain how the test works, it explains what the test does and how it is administered, but no hint to how it works. Granted I did scan the article, but if you want to explain to me exactly how it works, please do that.\n\nIf there are no laws that are racist, what exactly are you fighting?\n\nNo, I'm not triggered by cartoons on socks, I disagree with how that group of people is handling the situation. To call cops pigs is obviously extremely disrespectful and it's obvious when you look at how Nike is making those socks, that it is because of the Colin Kaepernick movement. I don't need to explain the correlation there.\n\n\"It is a fact that job applicants with black sounding names are less likely to get a response, even with identical resumes. I see nothing wrong with policies that attempt to correct this problem.\"\n\n\"Black sounding names\", that's racist. And maybe that has nothing to do with their race, and more to do with the fact that those names are harder to pronounce. The same reason support people from India make up white washed names so that people don't have to say the \"indian sounding names\". It's not to do with the names, but rather that their names are harder to pronounce, and when dealing with people, you don't want them struggling to say your name.\n"

You can't just say \"institutional racism\". You have to tell me what institution/group of people is racist and if there is not reasonable doubt that it is racist, I'll fight it with you.

Second, and more fundamentally, based on data from the U.S. Department of Education itself, the assumed funding disparities between racial and ethnic groups _do not exist_.\"\\\n\"The Education Trust, a non-profit advocacy group committed to closing the achievement gap, published a 2005 report on funding differences between the highest-minority and lowest-minority school districts in states and large cities.Leaving out the districts in the middle, however, can lead to misleading results.\"<https://www.heritage.org/education/report/the-myth-racial-disparities-public-school-funding#_ftn10>\\\n<http://www.hartfordinfo.org/issues/wsd/educationfunding/FundingGap2005.pdf>\\\n\"Colin Kaepernick is no longer in the NFL as a result of his activism, you seem to be discrediting his intentions for no apparent reason.

            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it directly links implicit bias to negative consequences for black individuals during police interactions, which is a significant and relevant issue in society. The Con argument, while raising valid points about the challenges of measuring implicit bias, does not address the real-world impact and implications of such biases in policing.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it presents a clear example of discrimination in the hiring process based on names. It provides a specific and tangible issue that needs to be addressed. The Con argument, on the other hand, focuses more on the language used rather than addressing the underlying issue of discrimination.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it focuses on the substantive issue of disparities in the criminal justice system, which is a critical societal concern. The Con argument, while mentioning the importance of constructive discourse, does not directly address the underlying issue of systemic injustice that Kaepernick's protest aims to highlight.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive because it acknowledges the existence of implicit bias and systemic discrimination, which can perpetuate inequality even without explicit laws targeting minority groups. The Con argument focuses solely on explicit discrimination through laws, which overlooks the broader impact of institutional racism.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it directly addresses the issue of underfunding in the education system and its disproportionate impact on people of color. The Con argument, on the other hand, makes a broad claim about racial equality being achieved in the legal framework without addressing the specific issue raised in the Pro argument.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it directly addresses a significant issue within the criminal justice system. The Con argument, while mentioning superficial symbols, does not provide a strong counterpoint to the importance of highlighting disparities in the system.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it focuses on Kaepernick's intentions being driven by social justice rather than financial gain, which is a strong moral stance. The Con argument, while raising a valid concern about generalizations, does not directly address Kaepernick's motivations for his actions.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it directly addresses the issue of biases based on names and highlights the need for proactive policies to address this issue. The Con argument, while relevant, does not directly counter the Pro argument and focuses on a different aspect of affirmative action policies.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it clarifies that the movement does not make a blanket statement about all police officers being racist, which addresses the concern of unfair generalization. It shows a more nuanced understanding of the movement's stance.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive as it directly addresses a serious issue of systematic oppression within the criminal justice system. It highlights the importance of shedding light on this issue, which is a crucial step towards creating positive change. The Con argument, on the other hand, focuses on criticizing the form of protest rather than engaging with the underlying issue.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive because it acknowledges the reality that discrimination still exists despite legal protections, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by marginalized groups. The Con argument is less persuasive as it oversimplifies the issue by claiming that racial equality has already been achieved within the legal framework, which ignores the systemic inequalities and biases that persist in society.",
            "The Pro argument is more persuasive because it highlights the concept of systemic discrimination and how laws can have disparate impacts on people of color without explicitly mentioning race. It addresses a deeper issue of structural inequality that may not be captured by the Con argument's focus on explicit discrimination in current laws."

                "content": "Allow me to lean on Aquinas, et al,\na bit here.\n\nA physical thing is composed of\nmatter. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a gas,\nliquid, solid or plasma\u2014it is still composed of matter.\n\nWe arrive at this simple conclusion by\nobserving the world around us and using our reasoning:\n\nA physical thing can not create\nitself.\n\n- That rock over there didn't create\n  itself. Something else had to create it.\n- That car over there didn\u2019t will\n  itself into being. Something had to\n  create it.\n- That building was created by\n  something.\n- The earth was created by something,\n  it didn\u2019t create itself.\n\nWe observe this fact, through\nscience, about every physical thing around us. There is not a physical thing that we observe that is believed to have\ncreated itself.\n\nOne can ask these basic questions\nabout every physical thing we observe\u2014 how did it come into existence? It could not have created itself, so WHAT\ncreated it?\n\nAs stated, when one asks this\nquestion repeatedly of everything, one ultimately arrives at the question \u201cWell,\nwhat about matter itself?\u201d (Reminds me of that Rocky & Bullwinkle quip, \u201cWassamatta\nU.!\u201d). \u201cWhat created matter?\u201d\n\nWell, when one asks the question \u201cWhat\ncreated matter?\u201d, it\u2019s reasonable to use our experience about everything else\nwe observe, via science, and draw the following conclusion \u201cMatter could not\nhave created itself because, as we witness around us, a physical thing can not\ncreate itself. It\u2019s reasonable to deduce\nthat this would apply to \u201cmatter\u201d itself.\u201d\n\nTherefore, \u201cmatter\u201d could not create\nitself. It\u2019s reasonable to conclude that\nwhatever created matter must be \u201cim-material\u201d (i.e. not composed of\nmatter). In fact, what created the\nuniverse must exist OUTSIDE the universe (how would it be part of the universe\nand create the universe?).\n\nThe sun is a physical entity in this\nuniverse. It is composed of matter, as\nis other physical entities in this universe. As shown above, the \u201csun\u201d could not have created itself. Nor could hydrogen.\n\nWhile it is true God has power over\nnature, why is that? Is it because maybe\nGod created nature?\n\n- Did the sun create nature? No\n- The Sun, though powerful, is still\n  subject to the laws of physics as well as the theory of relativity. These physical laws/theories bind things\n  within this universe. In other words, physical\n  objects in this universe (me, you...the car...the surfer...and yes, the Sun) are\n  bound by the laws of physics\n\nYour origin of life on Earth is\nflawed. The sun may have simply just provided the right temperature/pressure for life to begin, that in no way can be translated into \"The Sun created life\". That would be like saying the oven \"made the cake\"-- it just simply provided the right environment. In addition, timply because science has\nreplicated the building blocks of earth, this in no way proves that is HOW life\noriginated on earth. I can construct an Atari video game in my garage....that\ndoesn\u2019t prove my way was the way the original video game was constructed.\n\nYour theory on the formation and structure\nof the Earth is appealing. However,\nwhile it might explain the earth and it\u2019s formation, it fails to explain the\nformation of other physical objects outside our solar system. Nor does it explain things that have\nnon-physical existence, like thoughts, ideas, and concepts.\n\nJust because we schedule our\ndays/nights around the rotation of the earth to the sun, it the beginning it\nwas done out of necessity. Now, with the\nadvent of technology, it\u2019s more of a convenience. In fact, many activities are independent of\nNight/Day (can I get three cheers for them finally installing lights at Wrigley\nField??). I tend to schedule my work day\naround my Boss\u2019 needs\u2014I\u2019m not about to start worshiping him as a God.\n\nSo wow you may follow the path of\nthe ancient Egyptians and worship the Sun (Ra), one would question why? Through your power of reason and deduction, you\nshould be able to deduce that something had to have created the sun, and thus,\nbe more powerful than the sun.\n\nWhile I could refute everything you write in defense of worshiping the Sun, er, hydrogen, there's no need to -- the agove is sufficient refutation of your argment (particular what I drew from Aquinas, et al).\n\nThanks for playin'.\n"

                "content": "**Round 2**\n\nThanks for that response Con.\\\nCon seems to spend a lot of time discussing the creation of matter, the creation of nature, and the creation of objects outside of the solar system, none of which are remotely relevant to the resolution.\\\nBut, I've got 10,000 characters, and it's time to rebuttal.\n\n***Matter***\n\nPardon the irony, but this portion of Con's argument, well, doesn't matter.\n\nThe sun, praise be unto hydrogen, just needs to be worshiped as having power over nature and human fortunes to be considered god, so how matter is created or not is irrelevant to whether or not god is worshiped for particular characteristics.\\\nWhat's more important is whether or not the god of heliolatry exists, affirming half of my burden.\n\nCon begins:\n\n> \"Allow me to lean on Aquinas, et al, a bit here.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nOk, allow me to lean on the definition of god here, which mentions a superhuman existence **worshiped** for having power over nature and human fortunes, so let's try to stay relevant here, ok?\n\nCon naively continues:\n\n> \"What created matter?...what created the universe must exist OUTSIDE the universe...the sun is a physical entity in this universe...the Sun, though powerful, is still subject to the laws of physics.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nFirst, Con **concedes here that god exists** as a physical entity in the universe, so this **concession**, directly related to the part of the resolution \"God exists,\" cannot be overlooked by voters.\n\nSecond, what created matter is IRRELEVANT to the existence of a superhuman being worshiped for its power over nature and human fortunes.\\\nCreating matter, resisting physics, and existing outside of the universe are all NOT characteristics of the agreed-to definition of god in this debate.\n\nGod is worshiped?\\\nCheck.\\\nHumans depend on god to live?\\\nCheck.\\\nThese two points I just made were more relevant than ALL of Con's previous round.\n\n***Power Over Nature***\n\nI had pointed out a litany of examples where god has power over nature...here's what Con said.\n\nCon concedes:\n\n> \"While it is true God has power over nature, why is that?\"\n\nMy response:\\\nCon admits here that god has power over nature, supporting heliolaters in their worshiping of god for god's power over nature.\n\nTo answer the question, the reason why god has power over nature is that all of the things we consider part of nature here on earth are controlled by the power of god, I mean, without god, there is no nature on earth, so on the contingency of earthly nature on god ALONE demonstrates god's power over nature.\\\nPlus Con concedes god's power over nature.\n\nCon obliviously asks:\n\n> \"Did the sun create nature?\"\n\nMy response:\\\nYes.\\\nI had sourced that the formation of the earth was done by god mixing the right elements and coalescing the earth, and I also sourced that these created-by-god elements were the ingredients for the origin of life on earth, and these two components, earth with life, are the literal creation of nature on earth.\\\nGod created the nature we experience every day on earth.\n\n**Origin of life on earth**\n\nCon reckons:\n\n> \"Your origin of life on Earth is flawed.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nIs it now?\\\nDo tell why.\n\nCon shows ignorance:\n\n> \"The sun may have simply just provided the right temperature/pressure for life to begin, that in no way can be translated into 'The Sun created life'. \"\n\nMy response:\\\nI never said the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, created life, check the debate, I said that god was central to the origin of life on earth because of god's power over nature.\\\nAlso, Con ignores that it wasn't just temperature/pressure from god that allowed organic molecules and subsequent life forms to originate, because Con didn't bother to read the source I had provided on the subject.\n\nMy source had indicated god was \"used...for long-wave UV radiation to **generate** alanine, glycine, serine, glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and cystine from a CH4, C2H6, NH3, and H2S gas mixture,\" which were created by god when god formed the earth.\n\nGod was not only a catalyst for the origin of life.\\\nGod made the ingredients photo-genetically, and then mixed in god's energy to originate organic compounds and subsequent life forms.\n\nThe compounds were solar generated, Con.\\\nWhy did you ignore that?\n\n**Formation of the Earth**\n\nCon admits:\n\n> \"Your theory on the formation and structure of the Earth...might explain the earth and it\u2019s formation...it fails to explain the formation of other physical objects outside our solar system.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nNo one ever claimed that god created objects outside of the system of god.\\\nWhat a preposterous thought.\\\nNothing about god in this debate indicates that god must be responsible for creating things outside of the system of god.\\\nNothing.\n\n**Our Days and Nights on Earth**\n\nCon concedes:\n\n> \"we schedule our days/nights around the rotation of the earth to the sun\"\n\nMy response:\\\nCon concedes to the point that we organize our lives around god and that the value of a day-night cycle is only possible with god.\n\nCon continues:\n\n> \"in fact, many activities are independent of Night/Day (can I get three cheers for them finally installing lights at Wrigley Field??).\"\n\nMy response:\\\nCon highlights why we typically schedule baseball games during the day and, for that matter, most of our outdoor activities, because we are utterly dependent on and we function concurrently with god's appearance and lack thereof.\\\nGod provides us with guiding light when we are active, and soft, quiet darkness when we're resting.\n\n***Creation of the Sun, praise be unto hydrogen***\n\nThis bit from Con is another argument in a series of irrelevant arguments.\n\nCon gets condescending:\n\n> \"Through your power of reason and deduction, you should be able to deduce that something had to have created the sun.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nYeah, it was a cloud of interstellar dust that gravitationally collapsed into a hydrogen ball.\\\nThis doesn't change the fact that we heliolaters worship god for god's power over nature and human fortunes.\\\nThe event that created god does not negate god's existence, in fact, that event validates god's existence.\n\n***Worshiping God***\n\nCon puffs his chest:\n\n> \"While I could refute everything you write in defense of worshiping the Sun...\"\n\nMy response:\\\nYou're not going to because the arguments are insurmountable?\n\nCon continues:\n\n> \"...there's no need to.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nSo instead of Con using his round to refute that god exists or that god is worshiped or that humans depend on god to live, Con finds it sufficient to arbitrarily talk about matter, a really dumb argument from Thomas Aquinas, the creation of objects elsewhere in the universe, and then claim at the end of a completely irrelevant round \"I could refute...there's no need to.\"\n\nCon drops ALL relevant-to-the-resolution points made by Pro 1st round.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nHumans depend on god and Con agrees this god exists.\\\nPraise hydrogen.\n"

                "content": "Not remotely relevant? The whole point is, if you can use logic and reasoning to show that some \"thing\" had to create the universe, the sun, etc, it stands to reason that worshiping the Sun is illogical when something much larger, much more powerful than the Sun is \"out there\".\n\nSo if you make the claim that people are dependent on the sun, then I would argue \"Yes, and because the sun is dependent on something else, this something else is also super human and should be worshiped as a God. \"\\\nYep, and my response is, there something much greater than the sun-- superhuman too - more deserving of worship than the Sun. In fact, the sun depends on IT for it's existence.\n\nSorry, I did not concede that God is a physical entity. When did I concede that? Perhaps you have this debate confused with another one. lol. What I said is something immaterial (not of the material universe) had to create the universe (and thus the sun).\n\nCurious, why don't you worship Earth? We are totally dependent on the earth, are we not? Without the earth, we wouldn't survive. Earth's gravity holds us to it-- without it we'd drive off into space. The earth provides the nutrients we need, the rain we need, etc.\n\nHaving one or two super-human abilities does not a God make. Sorry. While the sun can melt an ice bridge extremely fast, that is not the only pre-requisite for being God. I can name a whole host of things that a human can do that a sun can't do. One would expect a God to do everything a human can do, and more:\n\n1. Type a response on a debate blog\n2. Play Eddie Van Halen's Eruption on guitar\n3. Make a margarita\n4. Think a thought\n5. Send a man to the moon.\n\nHow many suns can do the above things?\\\nSo while the sun may have super-human abilities, humans have quite a bit of super-sun abilities--things the sun can't do. If there are things we can do that the the supposed god can't do, one should question why it should be worshiped as a God.\n\nFormation\\\nYour argument claims that the Sun formed the Earth. Scientists disagree with you.\n\nOur Days and Nights - Again, my argument is simple:\\\nWe are not dependent on the sun any more providing guiding light. sorry.\n\nYou did mention one key word in your defense of God-- you said \"perfect\" shape.\n\nCurious, how do you define \"perfect\"?\n"

When did I concede that?\"\n\nMy response:\\\n1st round.\n\n> \"The sun is a physical entity in this universe. It is composed of matter.\"-Con\n\nYes Con, since you've already agreed that I, like the Egyptians, worship the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, and you agree that this entity is physical, you've affirmed the resolution for me.\\\nThanks again Con.\n\nCon asks:\n\n> \"Curious, why don't you worship Earth?\n\nMy response:\\\nSometimes I do...I'm sorry was this supposed to be a relevant point negating that my god is worshiped?\\\nIf so, it sucked.\\\nSo what if other things are worshiped for being superhuman?\\\nWhy does there have to be only one, again?\n\nCon gets ignorantly errant:\n\n> \"Having one or two super-human abilities does not a God make. Sorry.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nActually, by your own doing, that's exactly what it makes...sorry.\\\nYou agreed to the definition of superhuman and god, Con.\n\nsuperhuman - having greater powers than humans have.\\\ngod - a superhuman existence\n\nI demonstrated countless examples of the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, having greater powers than humans have, and that exactly does a god make.\\\nThanks for playing.\n\nCon continues:\n\n> \"I can name a whole host of things that a human can do that a sun can't do.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nSo?\\\nThis doesn't make god any less superhuman, because all of those things that god can do that humans can't.\\\nEven if humans have supersolar powers, it wouldn't negate that the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, has greater powers than humans rendering it superhuman.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nGod exists and humans depend on god to live, just ask Con.\n"

YOu have to point to other things, and not the dreams/thoughts themselves.\n2. You stretch definitions to fit what you want.\\\n   Likewise, you think the \"God\" simply means has some greater powers than a human. No, there is more to a God then just that. The mighty elephant is stronger than any man. One can say it has super-human strength. But i stand by my statement, having one or a few powers greater than a human does not a God make. Sorry. It doesn't work like that.\n\nGod exists and humans depend on god to live. That I believe. What you haven't proven is this: the sun is a God. The sun is a god in your mind. I get that. However, a key thing to remember is simply because you think it doesn't make it so. Of course, as an atheist, I'm sure you believe Truth is subjective. If you think it's subjective, one wonders why you engage in debate in the first place. If truth is the subjective, then you have to believe the other person is right as well-- it's their subjective truth, right?\n\nIn case your curious, I've already won the debate. This post isn't an argument, it's me just filling up space to complete the round. You know when the Spurs are winning by 25 points and there is like 2 minutes left in the game? They would sit Duncan, Ginobili, Parker, etc and put in the scrubs, the benchwarmers. My posts now are me just sitting Ginobili. I've put in the benchwarmers. The game is in-hand already. Watch out though...back in the day even the Spurs bench players were pretty incredible.\n"

You stretch it to mean what you want.

The sun is a god in your mind. I get that. \"\n\nMy response:\\\nNot only have I proven that the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, is worshiped, Con has proven it over an over again too.\\\nCon's called me out for worshiping the sun, praise be unto hydrogen, as god, Con referenced the Egyptians who worshiped god, and Con keeps repeating the error every round, right here as well, solidifying that my god is worshiped.\n\nThe mere fact that I've repeated the damn phrase about hydrogen so many times proves that I praise and worship the great hydrogen ball, and this satisfies the resolution.\n\nCon mentions truth:\n\n> \"Of course, as an atheist, I'm sure you believe Truth is subjective.\"\n\nMy response:\\\na) I'm not an atheist, I'm a heliolater.\\\nb) Even if I reject the god claim made by countless religions, I still believe there are objective truths.\n\nCon speaks foolishly:\n\n> \"In case your curious, I've already won the debate.\"\n\nMy response:\\\nHere's one last thing I've learned from debate.\\\nThe person who claims \"I've already won,\" is always insecure, uncertain, cowardly, inferior at debating, and the actual loser.\n\nWhen children know they're losing, they stomp their feet and say that they're winning.\\\nThanks for the concession Con.\\\nMaybe I'll prove that **your** god isn't real in a different debate...it'll be fun to watch you squirm to try to demonstrate such a ridiculous god.\\\nHahahaha, Con looks funny when he squirms.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThanks everyone, vote Pro.\n"

In this sense, beliefs are a necessary component in any question for truth, as we must accept things as true (believe them) in order to build upon those beliefs and reach new heights.\n\n**Specific Refutation**\n\nGranting that, in this context, the instigator is referring specifically to beliefs that without factual basis, are assumed, or otherwise lack a solif foundation on which to establish truth. Even these are still required in any search for the truth.\n\nIn making a deduction about available facts, the soundness of any conclusion depends on the validity of our initial premises. Our premises are themselves deduced from more basic premises or are assumed. If we discount any assumptions, then we can only have premises which have been deduced from other premises. This results in an infinite chain of logic argument without beginning, robbing us of the ability to even begin our quest for truth. We must start somewhere!\n\nWhere we start are the assumptions and axioms of our system. They are present in all of the sciences and even in more \"pure\" areas such as mathematics and logic. Some basic assumptions in science\\[2\\]:\n\n- That cause and affect exists as all as natural phenomenon;\n- That our observations of past events can give us insight into future events;\n- The physical world is governed by laws which are consistent everywhere and throughout time;\n\nWithout adopting _any_ beliefs whatsoever, we lack the ability to make any reasonable predictions of the future, and the grand adventure of science is ended before it can begin.\n\n**Point-by-Point Refutation**\n\nThe instigator made a number of points in this Round. I present those points in quotes, and my response in italics.\n\n- \"Humans are highly superstitious animals, and it is actually the norm to be delusional in human societies.\" - _Though irrelevant to the point at large, I will note that \"delusions\" are generally defined and identified by their abnormality._\n- \"The scientific method was designed to ascertain object truths about the physical mechanics of reality\" - _While I do not object to this simplification of the scientific method, I will note that its role in history runs counter to instigator's argument. The modern scientific method was largely built upon the views and ideas of Karl Popper. While Popper eschewed the role of induction in science, he did not object to the use of beliefs in the pursuit of science. In fact, he embraced their use! Rather than eliminate beliefs (which he calls \"conjectures\") Popper provided a method by which we can choose among them. The goal was not the elimination of conjecture, but to criticize it and, through falsification and empirical testing, arrive at the one that best describes reality\\[3\\]_\n- \"A scientific thinker is someone who has no beliefs or opinions about reality, and only holds to speculation, inquiry, theory and proven facts.\" - _I will note that the instigator offers no support for this definition of \"scientific thinker.\" (Indeed, it is presented as instigator's own opinion, which is ironic). Every person on Earth has held beliefs and opinions about reality (by any definition). We must then conclude that there are no \"true\" scientific thinkers, or perhaps this definition is incorrect. Given the purpose of such a definition as to classify something that exists in reality, we must discount this definition as flawed. Plenty of \"scientific thinkers\" throughout history have held beliefs or opinions about reality._\n\n**Summation**\n\nBeliefs, even those that are pure assumptions, are necessary in the search for truth. In addition to their necessity, there are immensely useful. I do not claim that they must be held without critical analysis, or never questioned, but rather it is through this process that we separate the wheat from the chaff. One has no use without the other and I challenge the instigator to provide any scientific fact, no matter how trivial, that is not rooted in some belief about the world.\n\n\\[1\\] _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy._ \"\\[T\\]he attitude we have, roughly, whenever we take something to be the case or regard it as true.\" From: <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/>\\\n\\[2\\] <https://undsci.berkeley.edu/article/basic_assumptions>\\\n\\[3\\] _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy._ \"\\[T\\]he nature of science as Popper sees it: at any given time there will be a number of conflicting theories or conjectures, some of which will explain more than others.\" From: <https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#GrowHumaKnow>\n"

Secondly, concluding that delusional notions are defined by their abnormality is assanine. Delusional notions are defined by their relationship to objective reality and if you think the majority of humans can't be wrong about a lot of things then I don't know how to help you other than to refer you to the nearest psychiatric ward.**While I do not object to this simplification of the scientific method, I will note that its role in history runs counter to instigator's argument.

These \"conjectures\" are merely postulations, guesses maybe, but not necessarily beliefs. Also the scientific method was built gradually and still has room for improvement, Karl Popper was significant to it's formation but he did not lay it's foundation or complete the development of it's methodology.**I will note that the instigator offers no support for this definition of \"scientific thinker.\" (Indeed, it is presented as instigator's own opinion, which is ironic).**\\\nThere is no official definition for scientific thinker, the irony is entirely semantic. What I am referring to is someone who applies scientific standards to everything they allow themselves to accept as truth.\n\n**Every person on Earth has held beliefs and opinions about reality (by any definition).**\\\nTrue, but that doesn't make it the best way to think. I am thinking long term here, humans will not always be humans (provided we don't go extinct before we reach type one civilisation status) and we will learn to think in entirely different ways. The first step towards that point is to change our culture globally and change the way people form ideas to make it impossible for them to be indoctrinated or programmed in the way they currently are by society.\\\n**We must then conclude that there are no \"true\" scientific thinkers,**\\\nIt's quite possible that this is the case. It is something that we must work towards through shifting the culture and changing the way successive generations are brought up.**Given the purpose of such a definition as to classify something that exists in reality, we must discount this definition as flawed.

To summarize:\n\n- Beliefs cannot be avoided;\n- Beliefs are necessary in order to build up to additional truths;\n\n**Beliefs Cannot be Avoided**\n\nMy opponent response to this point was to concede that humans are predisposed towards belief, but argued that this was not the \"best\" way to think and then speculated that, at some unspecified point in the future, humans will undergo some unspecified metamorphosis that results in human beings thinking in different ways. My opponent offers no evidence that this is the case, nor presents any sort of reasoned argument. It is bare speculation and should be rejected by the reader.\n\nAdditionally, the criteria of \"the best way to think\" is not what this debate is about. The debate, as presented originally, was that beliefs are useless and have no role in scientific thinking. It is this argument to which I am responding. If my opponent wishes to have a different debate, that will have to wait until this is one is over.\n\nHuman beings naturally believe things. This is undisputed.\n\n**Beliefs are Necessary**\n\nI alluded to a famous problem regarding logic in my previous round. Arguments and reasoning cannot be purely deduced. They _necessarily_ rely on premises which are accepted as true, but axiomatically, not based on reasoning or justification. My opponent does not dispute that this dichotomy exists, but suggests that these premises are merely \"considered\" rather than \"believed.\" While there are many cases where premises are accepted for the purposes of argumentation, the axioms that serve as the foundation of science, mathematics, and logic, are accepted - and believed - as true. To suggest they not be believed is to undermine the very foundation of the disciplines of knowledge upon which they are built.\n\nI presented (by way of example, and not as limitation) a series of axioms that are accepted in science. Of the first two (the existence of causation and its predictive qualities) my opponent simply states that they are not axioms, but provides no basis for accepting that claim. In contrast, I provided reference for these things _as assumptions_ rather than the results of reasoned argument or evidence.\n\nThe third assumption, that of the consistency of physical laws, has let to a confusion. I did not mean to suggest that our human-made models are consistent everywhere and throughout time, but that the actual laws of physics, _whatever they may be_ are what they are and are not different here, or there, now, or then, or in the future. Our approximations of these laws necessarily change as the accuracy of our observations change, upon which we refine our model to better reflect reality.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMy opponent has made a number of bare assertions, without actual argument or external support. In other places, my opponent simply offers bare refutation and, failing that, insults. I submit that these bare assertions are not enough to counter my arguments, cited and supported, and encourage the reader to vote accordingly.\n"

The reason humans feel the need to \"believe\" in things is because they don't know things and they are too much of a primitive gaggle of apes to admit it or realise it.\n\n\"speculated that, at some unspecified point in the future, humans will undergo some unspecified metamorphosis that results in human beings thinking in different ways.\"\\\nThis is a fact, actually. If humans don't go extinct or fall from civilisation somehow then we will inevitably evolve, implement biotechnology to guide our evolution, and develop new ways of thinking and ascertaining reality. On top of that even without anatomical changes to the brain humans have **always** developed new cultures and ways of thinking. Literally all of human history is proof that my statement is true, because humans constantly undergo change in their culture, values and thought processes over time.\n\n**Additionally, the criteria of \"the best way to think\" is not what this debate is about. The debate, as presented originally, was that beliefs are useless and have no role in scientific thinking.**\\\nThis is very relevant to the debate at hand, if you don't see that then I really think you need to adjust your meds. The debate is primarily about what thought process is **best** for ascertaining objective truth. Scientific methodology has proven to be the most effective methodology known to man, and my argument is that superstition is useless AKA faith based beliefs.\n\n\"Human beings naturally believe things. This is undisputed.\"\\\nThen human beings naturally form useless neurological connections known as superstitions. Whether humans can be conditioned to think scientifically in a general sense is debatable, but that doesn't even matter when it comes to whether beliefs are useless or not. Do men need nipples just because they have nipples?\n\n\"the axioms that serve as the foundation of science, mathematics, and logic, are accepted - and believed - as true. To suggest they not be believed is to undermine the very foundation of the disciplines of knowledge upon which they are built.\"\\\nThere is a reason that almost nothing is actually called a \"fact\" in science, have you noticed that? The things you refer to mostly pertain to theory, and some of it is proven methodology. But nothing in science is merely assumed and believed, this is antithetical to science. Science is about making observations, forming ideas and testing those ideas, to blindly accept an idea before it is proven is the exact polar opposite of what science is supposed to do.\n\n\"I presented (by way of example, and not as limitation) a series of axioms that are accepted in science.

In contrast, I provided reference for these things as assumptions rather than the results of reasoned argument or evidence.\"\\\nLOL. You literally just asserted that those things are assumptions but in actuality they are theories which are supported by evidence and logic. You debate in a deliberately deceptive manner, appealing to semantics, telling the opponent what their own statements mean and making assertions while claiming the opponent is making assertions when they are providing reasoned arguments.\n\n\"My opponent has made a number of bare assertions, without actual argument or external support\"\\\nI had hoped that whoever excepted this debate would be scientifically literate and know the difference between a theory and an assumption instead of cherry picking definitions and not only taking Popper's words out of context, but insinuating that he is the sole authority on the scientific method.\n\n\"I submit that these bare assertions are not enough to counter my arguments, cited and supported, and encourage the reader to vote accordingly.\"\\\nOh come off it you soddy pillock, this is a philosophical debate not something that can be addressed with references and citations, especially when your citation consists of cherry picked definitions and arbitrarily deciding that Karl Popper is the sole authority on how to think scientifically.\n"

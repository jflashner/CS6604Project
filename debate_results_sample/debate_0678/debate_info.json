                "content": "Thank you to my opponent for accepting the debate.\n\nI will be arguing this as a political resolution. So our goal for this debate will be to see who's solution to the issue ends up being better. If it is a combination. Then voters will have to decide for themselves who put more into the solution or if it was equal or neither really supported it, etc.. Let's begin.\n\nMy starting solution will be to legalize all drugs. I will hold this position for as long as my opponent doesn't change my mind.\n\nHere are my reasons.\n\n1. Drugs only cause self harm.\n\nThis is the biggest point for me. A person who does drugs is making a person decision in respect to their body autonomy. The act of using a drug in of itself, is not an immoral act. Now some people might say that self harm is wrong, but that's not an absolute and we have to look at individual situations. Lets take a look.\n\nA) Suicide.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, suicide and the next situation I bring up, are the only forms of self harm that are recognized to be illegal in most countries. Suicide is the act of immediately ending or attempting to end one's life. People who attempt suicide often have mental health issues that are so severe, that the person cannot function properly. In some cases. There are not huge mental health issues, but rather lesser ones like depression and this combined with life pressures, often leads to suicide.\n\nB) Self Mutilation\n\nThis is the act of destroying your body in some way. I think this situation gives us the most insight into our issue. Pretty much any form of self harm amounts to some form of self mutilation, with the exception of mental harm. Now the thing that helps us here is that not every form of self mutilation is illegal. Furthermore, many of these forms are accepted by society. So using this, we can establish a good standard for a norm in relation to drug use. So to the best of my knowledge, the only time self mutilation is illegal is when you cause dangerous bodily harm that would require IMMEDIATE medical treatment. Such as cutting yourself, or chopping off your own limb. Now one might say \"wait, don't gender confirmation surgeries apply to that category\" excellent question and yes they do. So now we need to ask ourselves, why aren't those illegal? Now some people might not agree with those surgeries. But there are analogous examples as well such as plastic surgery, and certain surgeries that involve the removing or changing of bodily organs.\n\nWhat we ultimately discover when we look at this is that when a doctor is doing the \"mutilating\" we don't have as much problem with it because there is a professional there to make sure that the person's immediate safety isn't at stake, even though the surgery in question might cause later self harm unintentionally.\n\nI think what this tells me is that society and the legal system seem to have a great deal of tolerance for \"slow self harm\". That is things that might potentially be harmful down the line, but aren't an immediate threat to you right now.\n\nC) Conclusion.\n\nAfter looking at this. It becomes clear to me that if we can hash out the nuances of drug use, we should be able to categorize it based on these standards. Currently, I believe that most, if not all drugs, would fall into the category of \"slow self harm\" and I have a precedent by which to say that we \"ought to let drugs be legal like cigarettes and other forms of slow self harm\"\n\n2. Drugs are a medical issue.\n\nI don't think anyone would deny this unless they thought I was double talking, so I'll clarify. when I say drugs are a medical issue. I'm not saying they can't also be a criminal issue sometimes because they can. For instance, there might be times where drug use during a trial might affect the outcome of the trial due to the circumstances it caused.\n\nWhat I'm really saying here is that whether or not there are times when drugs COULD be a criminal issue, They can still ALWAYS be a medical issue at the same time.\n\nI think it is fair to say that drug addiction is self evident in our society. With that said, we need good ways to fight this addiction. This means we need to invest some of our public resources into fighting this problem. It wouldn't be a handout but rather an investment. If we can lower drug use, then we can spend less money on the problem in the future. If we ignore it, it will climax and force us to spend money on it anyway. I say we take the initiative and stamp it out before it spreads any further.\n\n3. The drug war interferes with medical treatment.\n\nThis will probably end up being the crux of my initial position. It is my belief that the states involvement in drug issues makes drugs worse. Prisons are one of the best place to develop a drug addiction. Nobody is surprised to hear this. We see it on the news all the time. Gangs start drug rings. CO's try to manage it but generally fail and sometimes they get in on the action themselves. So if we want to fight drugs, wouldn't make sense to isolate drug users from non drug users in prisons?\n\nI propose that if we had state drug rehab facilities, we could lower drug use in the prison population. The prisons is the last place we want drug use because a prisoner who gets released is far more harmful as a drug user than the law abiding citizen who quietly smokes pot in their basement.\n\nAnother problem is that the state has historically been horrible about sentencing drug users. The 12 step program is just horrible and it's the biggest solution that courts use. It's even worse for atheists who get sentenced, but I'll avoid that for now because this isn't a god debate. The point is, that we should be trying to find the most cutting edge form of court ordered rehabilitation and the dogmatic implication of the 12 step program is keeping us from this goal.\n\nI would now like to hear my opponent's response to what I've said and we can begin to hash out details towards a solution.\n"

I will be arguing that most drugs should be illegal; and technically, I could focus on one of them due to the title but that wouldn't be very interesting.\n\n**My premises**\n\nMost drugs are addictive chemicals and block psychological inhibitory systems.\n\n_Fairly straight forward._\n\nDrugs cause harm to more than the individual.\n\n_Drugs harm isn't exclusive to the individual any more than suicide or mental illness._\n\nMost drugs and addictive chemicals are immoral.\n\n_Following the prior 2 premises I believe they could be considered 'immoral' by most standards of morality._\n\n**Acknowledgement**\n\nIt is my belief that the state doesn't have to jail people who are guilty of an offense.

                "content": "Excellent 1st Round. Let's Move to rebuttals.\n\n> Most drugs are addictive chemicals and block psychological inhibitory systems.\n\nI would like to add that not every drug is mental. A lot of drugs affect the physical aspect as well. But this statement is correct.\n\n> Drugs cause harm to more than the individual.\n\nDrug use itself does not harm other people. The act of selling drugs does not necessarily harm other people because it's no different than selling cigarettes or alcohol which are legal drugs.\n\nThe only thing that hurts people is their actions while they're on drugs. If the person uses the drug responsibly, there won't be any issue. Furthermore, if a person commits an illegal act while on drugs, we can already arrest them for that illegal act and it was not their drug use that caused the crime, but rather their irresponsible use. So instead of arresting people for drug use, we should be arresting them for drug misuse at the worst.\n\n> _Drugs harm isn't exclusive to the individual any more than suicide or mental illness._\n\nI don't think mental illness should really apply to this argument because it's something that is out of somebody's control and we're talking about behaviors here. Agreed?\n\nAs for suicide, it is the same thing that I said about drugs. The act of suicide in of itself is not harmful to anybody else.\n\nExcept in the rare exception that somebody jumps off a building and lands on somebody. For this case, I would say the same thing I said about committing a crime while on drugs. The person did not commit suicide responsibly, so if for some strange reason they lived, they should be prosecuted for it.\n\n> Most drugs and addictive chemicals are immoral.\n\nThey're only immoral if you're against slow self harm. Most people are not. Most people are okay with alcohol and cigarettes, so there is no reason to hold other drugs to a different standard. Even if people don't like drug use, those same people also probably think arresting them is not the solution. It's a medical issue. We can't help what people do to themselves because they have 24/7 access to their body and we don't.\n\n> It is my belief that the state doesn't have to jail people who are guilty of an offense. Specific to drugs, I believe we should force rehabilitation and psychiatric assistance in those shown to be clinically addicted. Jail time should be reserved specifically for dealers and gangsters.\n\nTo the first statement, if there is no crime, then the court should not be involved in the first place. The very fact that you want people not to go to jail for it reveals that you don't actually think it's a crime. I don't agree with your about dealers and gangsters have nothing to do with this debate so let's leave them out of it.\n\nIf drugs were legal, dealers wouldn't even exist anymore, so if you want dealers in jail so badly, then why not get rid of them by legalizing drugs? Then we'd have dispensaries with strict regulations. Furthermore, If we made drugs illegal. The dispensaries wouldn't sell every drug because some would get more popular and they would restrict their \"menu\" like a restaurant would. So this would even lower the amount of drugs used because if we made drugs exclusive in the dispensaries via the will of the market, people will gravitate more towards the popular drugs by default. Furthermore, people are more likely to kick a drug addiction if they don't get arrested or sentenced in any way. Forced rehab generally doesn't work and makes the problem worse. People need to be ready for rehab of their own free will.\n\nWould you court order somebody to go to the dentist?\n\nHow about the doctor?\n\n> I could focus on one of them due to the title but that wouldn't be very interesting.\n\nYou could do this, but keep in mind that we're aiming for a resolution here, So excluding one drug does not win you the debate, You have to prove that your solution will ultimately work better than mine. So if you exclude one drug, then I just exclude that drug and My solution was closer than your solution. I made this very clear in the description of the debate.\n"

                "content": "**Definitions**\n\nPsychoactive Drug: \"Psychoactive Drugs are chemical substances that act on the central nervous system to alter mood, perception, behavior, and/or consciousness. These drugs include sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, opiates, and psychiatric medications. \" [1]\n\nStimulants: \"Stimulants are drugs that arouse or excite the nervous system and speed up bodily processes. \" [2]\n\nSedatives: \"Sedatives are drugs or medications that act as depressants and slow down functioning of the central nervous system.\" [3]\n\nOpiates: \"Opiates are depressant type drugs that are derived from opium. Typically opiates are used to relieve pain and create a euphoric state of consciousness.\" [4]\n\nHallucinogens: \"These are psychedelic (\"mind-manifesting\") drugs that distort perceptions and produce sensory images (i.e., hallucinations) although there are no sensory stimuli that should produce such images.\" [5]\n\n**Stipulations**\n\nI will not be arguing against drugs with discernably little detrimental effect (e.g., coffee).\n\nAs you've rightly pointed out, many drugs are not psychoactive. I will be arguing against the legality of most psychoactive drugs, as the majority of them have severe consequences when used recreationally (such as addiction). [6]\n\n**Rebuttal**\n\n> \"Drug use itself does not harm other people. The act of selling drugs does not necessarily harm other people because it's no different than selling cigarettes or alcohol which are legal drugs. \"\n\n- Drug use harms both the immediate social environment, [7] and the society as a whole [8].\n\n- Why do you believe that selling these two things specifically does not harm other people? The cigarette is the single most deadly artifact to ever exist, and alcohol consumption is certainly not doing us any favors.\n\n> \"The only thing that hurts people is their actions while they're on drugs. If the person uses the drug responsibly, there won't be any issue. \"\n\n- Recreational drug use makes people more likely to be complicit, if anything this supports my side.\n\n- It's impossible to use a drug (like cigarettes) responsibly, the very act of smoking or drinking implies a lack of prudence.\n\n> \"As for suicide, it is the same thing that I said about drugs. The act of suicide in of itself is not harmful to anybody else.\\\n> Except in the rare exception that somebody jumps off a building and lands on somebody. For this case, I would say the same thing I said about committing a crime while on drugs. The person did not commit suicide responsibly, so if for some strange reason they lived, they should be prosecuted for it. \"\n\n- I'd rather not discuss this topic further, I don't know why I specified it.\n\n> \"They're only immoral if you're against slow self harm. Most people are not. Most people are okay with alcohol and cigarettes, so there is no reason to hold other drugs to a different standard. \"\n\n- I am going to hold alcohol and cigarettes to the same standard. Whether the majority of people believe it's acceptable or not is irrelevent to me as they're simply reflecting current cultural norms. Alcohol is immediately harmful, as are cigarettes.\n\n> \"To the first statement, if there is no crime, then the court should not be involved in the first place. The very fact that you want people not to go to jail for it reveals that you don't actually think it's a crime. \"\n\n- Should we abolish comunity service and house arrest? It seems to me many crimes don't warrant jailtime, the doesn't make them less criminal in nature.\n\n> \"If drugs were legal, dealers wouldn't even exist anymore, so if you want dealers in jail so badly, then why not get rid of them by legalizing drugs? Then we'd have dispensaries with strict regulations. Furthermore, If we made drugs illegal. The dispensaries wouldn't sell every drug because some would get more popular and they would restrict their \"menu\" like a restaurant would.

Furthermore, people are more likely to kick a drug addiction if they don't get arrested or sentenced in any way. Forced rehab generally doesn't work and makes the problem worse. People need to be ready for rehab of their own free will. \"\n\n- Legalizing drugs wouldn't get rid of the dealers. It would just shift the power dynamic of the countries further to the top of the ladder than it ever has been before. All of this by making the rich the dealers of the drugs.\n\n- Addiction adds a new level to this 'hypothesis,' in this hypothetical future, if dispenseries stop selling some drugs for monetary gain we'd be in the exact same position we are now. The only difference is the problem would be unsolvable due to a lack of legislation against harmful substances.\n\n> \"Would you court order somebody to go to the dentist? How about the doctor?\"\n\n- Sure, if their teeth were posing a significant threat to the people around them. Likewise, I would require them to go to the doctor to receive vaccinations.\n\n> \"You could do this, but keep in mind that we're aiming for a resolution here, So excluding one drug does not win you the debate, You have to prove that your solution will ultimately work better than mine. So if you exclude one drug, then I just exclude that drug and My solution was closer than your solution. I made this very clear in the description of the debate. \"\n\n- The title of the debate was: \"all drugs should be legal,\" in order to counter this statement I could simply state one drug which is incredibly dangerous and justify it being illegal. But that isn't interesting, so I proposed we specify parameters and types of drugs.\n\n**Sources**\n\n[1]: https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition-cit.php?term=Psychoactive+Drug\n[2]: https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition-cit.php?term=Stimulants\n[3]: https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition-cit.php?term=Sedatives\n[4]: https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition-cit.php?term=Opiates\n[5]: https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition-cit.php?term=Hallucinogens\n[6]: https://drugabuse.com/addiction/drugs-a-z//\n[7]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3725219/\n[8]: https://www.incb.org/documents/Publications/AnnualReports/Thematic_chapters/English/AR_2013_E_Chapter_I.pdf\n"

I remind you of this because you haven't met yours. We've agreed to specify most drugs rather then all drugs, so you should be attempting to prove most drugs should be legal.\n\nIt seems you haven't made any specific arguments and instead asked me several questions. Therefore, I will dedicate the next section to a response to those and clarification rather then rebuttal.\n\n**Response**\n\n> What would you specifically count as psychoactive drugs?\n\n- Anything fitting the source (1) definition, it isn't really a matter of personal opinion. There's a great many objective standards in pharmacology.\n\n> Wouldn't people do drugs even if they're illegal?\n\n- Even if they do, making it illegal offers us a method to provide them assistance.\n\n- Yes, and people will continue to murder if it stays illegal, that doesn't mean we should privatize the police force.\n\n> Doesn't making drugs illegal have it's own inherent harm by creating illegal drug dealers?\n\n- It certainly does under the current system, and there's a possibility that the future culture could become callous and uncaring towards those who are drug-addicted\\\n  under mine. I'm not going to pretend my plan is perfect, but it's better than having no legal standing and too much.\n\n> Wouldn't it be better to treat it as a medical issue?\n\n- I believe I said as much when I proposed psychiatric assistance to those clinically addicted. Other solutions could also be proposed to teach the disadvantaged and\\\n  addicted work-ethic and instill a positive outlook.\n\n> Wouldn't a drug addict have better chances of getting clean out in the world with the potential to work and make money and get clean rather than being in jail?\n\n- Possibly, but they'd require direction and disincentive at minimum for that to be true.\n\n> Don't you think we can come up with a better solution than using the criminal justice system in this case?\n\n- It is my firm belief that we don't have to abandon a preexisting system. There are many ways to improve our current situation without throwing drug-addled communities into the wind.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCertainly we should not be jailing drug-addicts and that is not my argument. I'm an advocate for both legal reform and illegal drugs at the same time; we are doing a tremendous disservice to these communities by assuming middle-ground isn't possible.\n"

The truth is, that drug use being illegal does not fit into other things that we've made illegal.\n\nMy problem is that I think you want drugs to stay illegal only because it's the norm. You admit yourself that it's a medical issue. You admit that making it illegal has inherent risks, but you ignore what that implies. So you agree with every reason for making it legal, and yet you seem to tacitly want it to be illegal because you want to hang on to some idea that this just HAS to be a good idea.\n\nThe fact is that historically, America did not fight drugs and did just fine. Prohibition was the great reminder that you can't stop people from hurting themselves. The drug war has made the same mistake as prohibition and the bootleggers are still here. History has repeated itself.\n\nOur society has created a new wave of Al Capones. We need to learn from the mistakes of the past and go with what actually works.\n\nI would urge you and the voters to ponder upon what the purpose of jail is. What the purpose of calling something a crime is.\n\nJail is to protect society from dangerous people, it is not a form of drug rehab. Crimes need victims, you cannot be a victim of yourself because it's 100% censual.\n\nYou're wrong that I can't argue for all drugs. Arguing for all drugs supports all lesser resolutions. You haven't given me much reason to step down to a lower resolution because you're not acknowledging that you can have what you want in a compromise. You admit the truth of things I say and then double talk and say that you still want to keep your position.\n\nThe fact is, if you made drugs legal, all of the people that you still want arrested under your view will still be arrested, so what's the problem?\n\nI implore you to consider the fact that you're married to this tradition of considering drugs immoral. Is it for biblical reasons? I don't mean to make this biblical, but I don't think god condemns drug use.\n\nI implore you to look at this without your worldview for a moment to better empathize with the drug users and even the dealers sometimes and I think when you pull yourself back in and really think about it, you can realize that we can both get what we want here.\n\nYour floor.\n"

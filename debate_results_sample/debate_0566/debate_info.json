The existence of God is causally impossible because in order for God to exist it would have to spontaneously appear from literally nothing as a fully developed sentient and all knowing entity. There would be nothing prior to God's existence to create whatever God is made of and nothing would exist for God to \"know\" because nothing would initially exist other than God, therefore God would not exist to begin with but if it did it would literally know nothing. The only way to get around this is to postulate some type of primordial quantum loop or \"possibility cloud\" which God spawned from and draws information from, which is equally impossible because it requires everything to both infinitely exist and not exist at the same time before existence was even a thing.\\\nRM posted this in the comments, I did not use it for this argument as that would be cheating in a way but it may be helpful for you to read this.\\\n<http://www.humanreligions.info/god_is_impossible.html>\n"

This is just the logical fallacy known as an [augment from incredulity](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Argument_from_incredulity).\n\nI am claiming that the rules of causality render God's existence impossible, which is an undeniable statement. We are talking about a sentient being who exists with no substance or force to bring it into existence and an all-knowing being who has no information to draw from. Not only is God's mere existence impossible, but to think the first thing that would spawn out of literal nothingness would be such a complex and perfect construct is also bonkers. My understanding may be limited, but that does not mean the downright ludicrous can be true.\n\n> Our universe could (however much we dislike the notion) be a [simulation](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Simulated_reality).

We are talking about the literal Abrahamic notion of \"God\" here specifically, the supernatural all powerful being that spawned from nothing and created everything. A cyborg alien with a quantum computer doesn't fit the definition of \"God\".\n\n> Merriam-Webster defines [existence](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/existence) as **\"reality as presented in experience.\"**\n\nAre you suggesting that if I smoke PCP and see fairies then the fairies are real just because the dictionary says so?\n\n> We can say anyone who has experienced God is insane, but that does not negate that tangible existence. An experience so strong it has caused countless wars, which furthers the reality of Gods impact upon the world.\n\nYes, people believe in God, people do stuff in the name of God because they believe in God, this doesn't make God real at all.

Not understanding the cause of something, does not make it impossible that there is one.

Oranges for example are generally orange, you can hold a debate that they are secretly blue, but you'll be proven wrong pretty much instantly because words have meaning.\n\nDefinitions are not always so clear cut. Language itself is socially constructed so the definition of \"blue\" could be changed to \"orange\" and if everyone went along with it then that would be how it is. But more to the point, when you get to more abstract philosophical definitions, there will undoubtedly be some issues with the perspective/outlook of the ones writing the dictionary. No human truly understands the nature of existence in a complete sense, and to top it off you merely cherry picked one interpretation of the word \"existence\" to begin with. There are multiple definitions pertaining to multiple contexts and schools of thought.\n\n> Just to remove any doubt that this seals my victory, [more than 55%](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/04/05/christians-remain-worlds-largest-religious-group-but-they-are-declining-in-europe/) (or 4.2 billion people) of the world population actively believes in God; while they may be illogical, God's existence through their experience is not in question. In fact the more illogical that is, the more it suggests they've had some experience with God strong enough to devote their lives to such a belief system.\n\nI couldn't care less what people believe. In fact, this should be so obvious as a non-issue to any thinking person that it doesn't even warrant rebuttal. For the sake of smoking PCP though I will address it. Humans believe things that aren't true all the time and there are countless conflicting beliefs which are believed by many people. What makes you think one idea is more valid just because it is believed by a larger number of superstitious apes?\n\n> Denied.

Also you are straw-manning by claiming that I am insisting that a simulation could never exist. Do you not understand the causal difference between a simulation made in a computer and a magic God that literally pops out of nothing?\\\nAs for the big bang theory I actually do not believe in that either, but at least it has a theoretical basis. There is literally no evidence of God and hence you automatically lose because thus far you have provided no evidence and a bunch of word salads while I have presented a sound argument.\n\n> Thank you for weakening your own case with such a silly [straw-man](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Straw_man) fallacy. You're agreeing that it's possibly a simulation, but impossible that anyone involved could have been come to be known locally as God because you don't know if God is a cyborg, and all beings that run simulations are cyborgs. Going back to the [Scientific America](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation/) article I previously shared, which wrote of an event attended by many physicists (whose job requires them to regularly run simulations) but not one mention of them being aliens or cyborgs was made (the attendance even one \"cyborg alien with a quantum computer,\" would have overshadowed everything else at the event and the rest of the year's news-cycle).\n\nYou're clearly mentally unwell, which is not ad-hominem but an observation which in and of itself brings the validity of your claims into question. By fixating on the term \"alien cyborg\" you are completely ignoring the actual point. A simulation is completely different from a magic God-spirit which manifests from nothing. God cannot exist because of causality and probability, some entity or group creating a simulation in a laboratory is not the same as a perfect infallible being self assembling and creating the universe from nothing.\\\nYou seem to be less interested in the truth than you are in misrepresenting my arguments.\n\n> Are you trying to argue that **The Existence of Star Wars is Impossible?** It would be fine if you want to move the goalpost that that. Star Wars is of course not historically accurate, but people do not pay out billions to see it in theater if it's a blank screen and no sound.\n\nStar Wars exists as a concept and as a work of fiction, that doesn't mean Darth Vader is out there force-choking people in a galaxy far far away. You would need an extraordinarily infantile intellect not to see the difference.\n\n> Thank you for conceding that God has physical existence (even if a limited one). ... Pretty much to backtrack on this, you would need to deny humans exist (along with everything else), since we're walking piles of chemicals and electric impulses.\n\nThis is an absolute train-wreck for you assuming the voters have any brains.

However, I only win this if any were of notable quality.\n- S&G: Tied. Neither of us were illegible.\n- Conduct: I suggest re-reading pro's final paragraph.\n\n**Pro's Star Wars Tangent:**\n\n> Star Wars exists as a concept and as a work of fiction\n\nKey word: \"exists.\" I already pointed out it's fiction (\"not historically accurate\"), so I am very unclear as to the point of complaining about movies that exist; or for that matter how Darth Vader disproves the very possibility of God's existence.\n"

Debating you is pointless because you are a cheap pseudo-intellectual weasel trying to avoid having to actually win by debating.\n\n> My point stands uncontested. Pro did provide a link, but the link was off topic (attempting to prove they did not live up to modern libertarian ideals, is different from implying they were not anarcho-capitalists).\n\nCeltic Ireland was tribal, and had \"kings\" according to the article I posted. Also, Anarcho-Capitalism is a form of extreme right wing libertarianism, rather than just \"small government\" they would eradicate the government entirely. That being said, the article was absolute over kill, because not only are they not Anarcho-Capitalists, they weren't even Libertarian Capitalists.\n\n> \"It didn't last very long\" does not prove \"never\" as would be required by this debate resolution.

In smaller communities it can last a lot longer especially since they had outside support and they still technically were subject to Colonial Rhode Island law so it wasn't lawless.\n\n> **Albemartle (23 years):** I'll grant that it was not a pure sample. While similar, it was libertarian instead of properly anarcho-capitalist.\n\n\"My point stands uncontested.

Sure, the weeds are gone...but so is the garden.\\\nAlso for 99% of it's citizens, China's system does not work as they are living in abject poverty and slavery.\n\n> If they don't work they won't last (and are unlikely to form at all), so this point was in my favor without any need for refutation.\n\nActually, no. A monopoly may \"work\" for a monopolist but it doesn't work for society, which should be obvious. Also since the goal of Anarcho-Capitalism is a free market and to be free from institutional control over your life, and monopolies both inhibit free market activity and have power over people's access to the means of production, it definitely does not work for Anarcho-Capitalism. The more monopoly there is the less Anarcho-Capitalist it is, because the free market is destroyed and the rich become the government.\n\n> Irrelevant as being nice is not required for a system to work.\n\nIt's not about being \"nice\", it's about not murdering someone and stealing all their shit rather than engaging in free market activity because there is nothing to uphold law and order in an anarchic society.\n\n> People on average are not thieves and murderers; it does not take the presence of a state sponsored police officer to stop people from raiding and pillaging the local farmers market en mass. You see something you like at a friend's house, they could probably not prove in court that you stole it, but it remains in their possession rather than yours. Thus the existence of private property does not rely on the government.\n\nIf there was no law, then you would be able to get away with a lot more, thus many people would. In fact, so many people would, that it would cause others to resort to the same thing just to survive, and it would begin a vicious cycle of serial killing, serial looting shinanigans.\n\n> These exist in any system, and do not prevent them from working. As anyone who's been to a dance-club or rock concert probably notes, it's usually private rather than state issued protection. Were the state to do a perfect job on this, private security companies would not exist.\n\nONLY private ones would exist, and they would not be beholden to law but to whoever pays them. Private security agencies are still subject to law when there is a government.\\\nThis would cause the system to not work, because it would destroy the free market and turn anarchy into tyranny.\n\n> **\"Eventually... The One Percent\":** While I could explain the flaws in the assumptions, pro has pre-refuted this point by insisting\\*\\*\"who owns what would be decided very often.\"\\*\\*\n\nThe latter in no way refutes the former. You should probably not be smoking crack before you post in a debate.\n\n> **\"It Would End Up...\":** Pro chose to insist that this (along with point #6) in no way indicate something did not work (R2, P2). That eventual failure is **\"not even part of my argument\"** converts this into a virtually a concession that something lasting long enough\\*\\*\"end up...\"\\*\\* means it worked.\n\nThe way you debate makes me seriously wonder if you have a learning disability.\n"

            "The Con argument provides specific historical examples (Iceland and Albemarle) that support the claim of successful long-term functioning under anarcho-capitalistic frameworks, which adds credibility and relevance. In contrast, the Pro argument is more of a critique without offering a counterexample or alternative evidence, making it less persuasive overall.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it highlights the historical context of societal norms and voluntary interactions that have successfully upheld the non-aggression principle without the need for state enforcement. It suggests a practical framework for how such principles can function in society, while the Pro argument lacks specific examples or mechanisms to support its claim about the wealthy imposing rules.",
            "The Con argument provides specific historical examples (Iceland and Albemarle) that suggest the viability of anarcho-capitalistic frameworks, which adds credibility and context to the claim. In contrast, the Pro argument lacks depth and does not provide a counterexample or evidence to support the assertion that the cited societies were not true anarcho-capitalist societies, making it less persuasive.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it asserts that historical cases provide evidence of functional anarcho-capitalism, suggesting that there are real-world examples where such a system has worked effectively. In contrast, the Pro argument critiques the historical examples without providing a strong counterpoint or alternative evidence, making it less compelling.",
            "The Con argument effectively acknowledges the inevitability of entropy while also asserting that systems can function successfully for a time, which provides a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between entropy and system performance. The Pro argument, while valid, seems to dismiss the potential for temporary success in anarcho-capitalism without addressing the complexity of how systems can operate before failing.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it asserts that historical cases provide evidence of functional anarcho-capitalism, which can be backed by specific examples. In contrast, the Pro argument dismisses the examples without providing a counter-argument or evidence to support the claim that they are not true anarcho-capitalist societies, making it less compelling."

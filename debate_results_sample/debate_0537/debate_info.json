The \u201cclouds and humidity\u201d factor is mind bogglingly complex. For example, high clouds tend to warm the planet, but low clouds tend to cool it. So which effect rules? Models don\u2019t know, but they assume clouds are net-warming. This is not a minor point: The feedback from clouds and humidity accounts for more than half of carbon\u2019s alleged effect. E\u2019Gad.\n\nThus, the above data shows that CO2 has zero effect on the climate and that if there was any change, then cloud cover would compensate for this change and reduce temperatures back to normal. This is because the Earth is a thermostat and can regulate its own temperature using cloud cover. Thus, if my opponent insists that CO2 is adding 0.0000000001 degrees Celsius warming, then this would be countered by cloud cover which would effectively cancel out this extra warming.\n"

                "content": "CO2 is a gas that is present in the atmosphere, that indeed does cause climate change.\n\n**Greenhouse effect principle.**\n\nMost energy gets to the earth from the sun in the form of UV and visible light radiation. It is absorbed and reflected back by the earth in the form of infra red radiation.\n\nGases in the atmosphere that are transparent to UV, but absorb infrared allows the energy from the sun to hit the ground, but absorbs more of the heat coming from the earth. This is referred to as \u201cthe greenhouse effect\u201d\\[1\\]\n\n**Properties of Carbon Dioxide**\n\nThe observable properties of CO2 are such that it also acts a greenhouse gas\\[2\\]\n\nSatellite observations show that the amount of radiated heat is going down as temperatures increase \\[3\\] with a spectrum that correlated to more heat being absorbed by carbon dioxide.\n\n**Effect of heat on the climate**\n\nClimate itself can be affected and modified caused by the heat in the atmosphere, with increased heat driving more changes in climate, including more severe weather. \\[4\\]\n\nThe current rise in temperature of the earth, and the climate that is observably changing coincidence with an increase in co2\\[5\\] because of the above there can be expected to be a causal relationship: co2 traps heat, more co2, more heat.\\[6\\]\n\n**Contribution of heat from Carbon Dioxide**\n\nThis increase of temperature from co2 increase is logarithmic, meaning that each time the co2 in the atmosphere is doubled, the amount of radiation reflected downwards increases by a linear amount 3.7W/m2, this works out to be approximately 1 degree per doubling without factoring any other process.\\[7\\] this indisputably shows that carbon dioxide is able to change the climate.\n\nWhen considering feedback mechanisms - such as changes to the earth\u2019s albedo due to heat, the cumulative effect of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and other related effects, the effect of the increase in thermal energy is actually more significant, or about 3 degrees for each doubling \\[8\\]. This rate is consistent with temperatures in different geological time and the carbon concentrations during this periods, including during recent ice ages and past geological periods where the earth was much warmer. \\[9\\]\n\n**Source of carbon dioxide.**\n\nFinally, it\u2019s clear that humans have been responsible for the current elevated emissions. A primary way we can tell this is that by measuring the isotopic breakdown of the carbon in the atmosphere - this content has increased in line with the isotopic content of fossil fuels rather than other sources: meaning that much of the addition carbon concentration is being generated by humanity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nHuman co2 emissions have increased the co2 content in the atmosphere, which due to its chemical properties is affecting the climate.\n\n\\[1\\] <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect>\\\n\\[2\\] <https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wea.2072>\\\n\\[3\\] <https://www.skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm>\\\n\\[4\\] <https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange//kids/impacts/signs/oceans.html>\\\n\\[5\\] [https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide](https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/)\\\n\\[6\\] <https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21691>\\\n\\[7\\]<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity>\\\n\\[8\\]<https://skepticalscience.com/why-global-warming-can-accelerate.html>\\\n\\[9\\]<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide_in_Earth%27s_atmosphere>\\\n\\[10\\] <http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2004/12/how-do-we-know-that-recent-cosub2sub-increases-are-due-to-human-activities-updated/>\n"

He has, instead, decided to give a lecture on the establishment or IPCC version of climate change.\\\nNote - That the IPCC ignores data that they don't like or disagrees with the global warming preconceived assumptions.\n\nLets go back in time to find the beginnings of climate change thinking.\n\nIt all started with John Ruskin's \"plague wind\"\n\n.<https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/12/ruskin-paris-climate-change/420453/>\n\nCommunists like Karl Marx were influenced by Ruskin, Carlyle and Disraeli.\n\nThus, the concept that the industrial age was a threat to the environment was born. Thus, climate change is essentially a communist system idea and a way of introducing communists ideas through the use of climate change as a clever disguise.\n\nThat leads us to Maurice Strong the person most responsible for the forming of the IPCC.\n\n<https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/paris-climate-change-conference/12035401/Farewell-to-the-man-who-invented-climate-change.html>\n\nExtract -\\\nIn 2005, Strong was caught having been illicitly paid $1 million from the UN\u2019s Oil for Food programme, supposedly set up to allow Saddam Hussein to pay in oil to feed starving Iraqis. He retired to a flat in Beijing, where he had been close to China\u2019s Communist leaders back to Mao. It was from there that he returned home to Canada to die,on November 27.\n\nThus, Maurice Strong was clearly acting for the communists and their ideals.\n\nThe graph below shows that the suns energy varies in 11 year cycles which relates to aether flow blockage from large planets like Saturn and Jupiter.\n\n<http://lasp.colorado.edu/home/sorce/files/2011/09/TIM_TSI_Reconstruction-1.png>\n\nThis can cause an average temperature change of 0.2 degrees over a ten year period. Note - Some periods are stronger than others depending on the planets relative positions to one another in relation to the Earth. Note - More light equals more heat.\n"

As a result, it is an indisputable fact that carbon dioxide is increasing the temperature of the planet.\\[1\\]\n\nSecondly, pro omits a key fact: The earth is heating up, and the climate is currently changing as a result. \\[2\\]\n\nThe idea that changes in cloud cover as a means to stabilize the temperature of the earth is clearly refuted by the fact that the temperature of the earth isn\u2019t currently being stabilized by clouds.\n\nWhile It is true that we do not know exactly the overall effect of clouds on his much the world will heat up, the argument that it will not heat up is clearly refuted by the fact that the world is currently heating up.\\[3\\]\n\n**Climate change is communism / The IPCC leader was a communist**\n\nNothing pro said here offers any argument against the scientific data I provided in the first round.\n\nThe majority of pros point is speculation and insinuation that do not appear to be warranted by the data and sources he provided.\n\nIf pro is to show conspiracy, he must show evidence and argument that the current IPCC, all climate data and science and related studies are all more likely to be fraudulent than not, and give reasons why this is the case.\n\nMerely throwing two tangentially related peices of information, and then asserting that it proves the last 40 years of climate science, and all related data is all a hoax is absurd and should be rejected by voters.\n\nMoreover, this is also a genetic fallacy. Even were it true that the idea that humans are harming the environment, came from communism - doesn\u2019t render anything that has been said wrong.\\[4\\]\n\n**Sun cycles.**\n\nFirstly, the sun varies in cycles of 11 years as pro suggests. However the heating of the earth as measured over the last 100 years, and specifically the continued and rapid heat rise since 1980 clearly shows the heating does not correlate with an eleven year cycle, but has continued to rise consistently.\\[5\\]\n\nSecondly, if the suns contribution is 0.2 degrees, then there is 3 times as much warming still to be accounted for. 0.6 degrees of warming that cannot be accounted for in terms of solar output.\n\nFinally Pro refutes himself here again: after having said that clouds mitigate temperature rises, he now claims that temperature rises are caused by the sun and are not mitigated. How can pro say cloud cover mitigates warming but also doesn\u2019t motivate warming? This is obviously an example of kettle logic.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nPro has answered none of the points raised in my opening round, and has dropped all my arguments. I extend all of these to the next round.\n\nPros arguments fall afoul of basic logic, relying on assertions that are trivially refuted above.\n\nThe resolution is negated.\n\nSources.\n\n\\[1\\] <https://www.skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm>\\\n\\[2\\] <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming#/media/File%3AAnnual_Mean_Temperature_Change_for_Land_and_for_Ocean_NASA_GISTEMP_2017_October.png>\\\n\\[3\\]<https://e360.yale.edu/features/investigating-the-enigma-of-clouds-and-climate-change>\\\n\\[4\\] <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_fallacy>\\\n\\[5\\] <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming#/media/File%3AGlobal_Temperature_Anomaly.svg>\n"

He failed to address the fact that upper and lower cloud formations have warming and cooling effects which lab and computer models are completely hopeless at trying to simulate or predict. Thus, most weather forecasters can't even predict tomorrows weather pattern without any degree of certainly. I have often looked out my window at amazement of the current weather conditions in comparison to the weather forecast by government climate agencies. There is usually quite a huge difference in actual weather to predicted weather. Thus, how can a government agency which can't accurately predict tomorrows weather, then, go on and try to predict the weather or climate in 50 or 100 years into the future?

                "content": "**IPCC Graphs are fakes.**\n\nPro states the IPCC faked its data, but the data doesn\u2019t come from IPCC. The data has been independently measured from at least 3 sources, NASA-GISS \\[1\\], NOAA\\[2\\], and HADCRUT\\[3\\] from the Uk met office. These are all independent and all broadly agree about temperature rises, and all formed part of the dataset from which the IPCC to draw conclusions.\n\nPro has presented no evidence that NASA, the NOAA and the met office all manufactured their data.\n\nIn addition, anecdotal evidence corroborates a warming earth. Glaciers are retreating around the globe\\[4\\], the extent of North Pole ice decreasing\\[5\\], and sea levels are rising\\[6\\]\n\nWhile a graph can be faked, it\u2019s hard to melt glaciers, or raise the sea levels around the world artificially without people noticing if it were possible at all.\n\n**Clouds.**\n\nPro accuses me of dropping his cloud argument. This was clearly and fully addressed in round 2.\n\nTo reiterate: if it were possible for clouds to prevent warming of the planet, the the planet would not currently be warming - which it demonstrably is.\n\nEven pro himself admits the sun contributes 0.2 degrees of warming variation. **_Pro can\u2019t assert the earth isn\u2019t warming for one argument, then assert that it is for another_**\n\nSecondly, as I also pointed, we can tell co2 is decreasing the heat reflected into space, which means we can demonstrably tell the earth must be retaining more heat, and due to the spectrum we know it\u2019s due to co2. (See round 1). This point was **dropped** by pro.\n\nBoth these facts refute pros claim that clouds prevent warming. As pros argument is refuted, haggling over whether high clouds, or low clouds have the most impact is largely irrelevant - as we know that whatever impact they have, is not enough to prevent warming.\n\nThis debate is whether co2 is driving global climate change, not to defend one particular climate model or another, or to defend warming estimates from one source or another. As a result, pros demands for me to justify relative warming of cloud cover are a red herring.\n\n**Climategate proves a conspiracy.**\n\nFirstly, this wasn\u2019t the IPCC, this was a different organization, the CRU.\n\nSecondly, it was talking about tree ring data, not global temperatures.\n\n\u201cMikes trick\u201d, was to show global temperatures on the same graph as tree ring data.\n\nMost importantly, the decline in question was only being discussed, and was part of the scientific literature, and discussed in the IPCCs 2001 and 2007 report.\\[7\\]\n\nThe idea that the decline was being covered up whilst being publicly discussed is mostly nonsensical.\n\nThese hacked emails reflected private correspondence between colleagues, with the worst sounding examples being cherry picked.\n\nConsidering that hackers had thousands of emails and documents, that an easily explainable email is the best evidence - rather than original datasets, emails outlining actual conspiracy such as explicitly stating they were going to make up data, or referencing that conspiracy - clearly indicates pros point is wishful thinking.\\[8\\]\n\nIf this were not enough, an independent investigation found that the CRU's work had been:\n\n> \"carried out with integrity\" and had used \"fair and satisfactory\" methods. The CRU was found to be \"objective and dispassionate in their view of the data and their results, and there was no hint of tailoring results to a particular agenda.\" Instead, \"their sole aim was to establish as robust a record of temperatures in recent centuries as possible\u201d\\[8\\]\n\nThis means the accusation is a matter of perception only, not fact.\n\n**Climate change is a communist conspiracy.**\n\nPro continues to assert, without any evidence, that climate change is a communist plot.\n\nAs discussed pro does not offer any real support for this claim for me to refute. Thus it should be rejected.\n\n**Solar cycles.**\n\nPro says the sub accounts for 0.2 degrees of warming. The earth has warmed by 0.8 degrees (see sources above), meaning 3 times the suns contribution to warming (0.2 x 3 = 0.6) remains to be accounted for.\n\n**The sun is on a 200 year cycle.**\n\nPro blamed the warming that he claimed doesn\u2019t exist on an 11 year solar cycle. When this was refuted he now blames the warming he claims doesn\u2019t exist on a 200 year cycle he provides no evidence for.\n\nPro needs to make up his mind whether the warming patterns exist or not, he can\u2019t argue both sides.\n\nThere is no evidence of a 200 year cycle in sunspots since the dalton minimum, even if there were, as the dalton minimum was a low temperature period, a 200 year cycle means we should current be the coldest point.\\[9\\]\n\n**The IPCC doesn\u2019t account for the sun.**\n\nPro argues that the IPCC pretends that sun doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nPro didn\u2019t even bother to google \u201cIPCC Sun\u201d, as if he had it would have shown multiple resources and links to reports that analyze the suns impact.\n\nThe first 4 links are from the 4th annual report, which factors associated with the sun was mentioned in detail in 4 different chapters:\n\n- 1.4.3 \u201cSolar variability and total solar irradiance\u201d\\[10\\]\n- 2.7.1.1 \u201cdirect observations of solar irradiance\u201d\\[11\\]\n- 6.6.3.1 \u201cSolar forcing\u201d \\[12\\]\n- 9.3.3.2 \u201crole of volcanism and solar irradiance\u201d\\[13\\]\n\n**Drops and conclusion.**\n\nPro argues that warming both does and does not exist. Claiming both that clouds prevent any warming, and that the warming is down to the sun. This is clearly incoherent.\n\nPro **drops** **the majority of the scientific basis presented from round 1**, including evidence to support the role of co2 in the climate. I extend these across the board.\n\nPro **drops** my refutation of logarithmic carbon heating.\n\nPro **drops** my refutation of clouds mitigating climate change\n\nIn fact, pro seems to simply be throwing things at the wall to see what sticks, countering the well evidenced facts I\u2019m providing with mostly insinuations and unevidenced assertions - this is not how debate works.\n\nPro must provide substantial evidence that the IPCC and multiple other organizations are lying and manufacturing all evidence. Once can not simply assert this is the case on flimsy links.\n\nThe evidence and argument provided clearly shows that co2 is driving climate change and has not been addressed by pro.\n\nAs a result, the resolution of this debate is clearly negated.\n\n\\[1\\]\\\n<https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/global-temperature/>\\\n\\[2\\]\\\n<https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201704>\\\n\\[3\\]\\\n<https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut3/>\\\n\\[4\\]\\\n<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850>\\\n\\[5\\]\\\n<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_sea_ice_decline>\\\n\\[6\\]\\\n<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise>\\\n\\[7\\]\\\n<https://www.skepticalscience.com/Mikes-Nature-trick-hide-the-decline.htm>\\\n\\[8\\]\\\n<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatic_Research_Unit_email_controversy>\\\n\\[9\\]\\\n<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle#/media/File%3ASunspot_Numbers.png>\\\n\\[10\\]\\\n<https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ar4-wg1-chapter1.pdf>\\\n\\[11\\]\\\n<https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg1-chapter2-1.pdf>\\\n\\[12\\]\\\n<https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg1-chapter6-1.pdf>\\\n\\[13\\]\\\n<https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/ar4-wg1-chapter9-1.pdf>\n"

The [UN 62nd General assembly in July 2008 said](http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/ga10725.doc.htm): ...**it had been estimated that there would be between 50 million and 200 million environmental migrants by 2010.**\\\n**The Test:** Did population go down in these areas during that period, indicating climate refugees were on the move? [The answer, no](http://asiancorrespondent.com/52189/what-happened-to-the-climate-refugees/).\n\nMore lies from an organisation that Con says is TRUSTWORTHY, RELIABLE and COMPETENT.\n\n4. Clouds can cool Earth issue.\n\nCon tries to navigate around this issue by restating that his temperature graphs are not lies. Thus, Con uses one lie to hide another lie.\\\nNote - The house of cards is getting higher and higher Con.\\\nQuote - \"Pros demands for me to justify relative warming by cloud cover is a red herring\" (grammar corrected version)\\\nNo Con, they are clear evidence that the climate change model is illogical nonsense.\n\n5.Quote -\n\n> - There is no evidence of a 200 year cycle in sunspots since the dalton minimum, even if there were, as the dalton minimum was a low temperature period, a 200 year cycle means we should current be the coldest point.\\[9\\]\n\nI have given Con a reference graph in the last post. Con didn't open his eyes and look at the graph provided.\n\n<https://wattsupwiththat.com/2010/12/20/a-dalton-minimum-repeat-is-shaping-up/>\n\nThe graph clearly shows that the sun's activity has slowly increased since the Dalton Minimum. This would account for any change in climate so you don't have to look for a cause like CO2 when the answer is already staring you in the face. Being a smarty pants. Con will say that I am agreeing that there has been a temperature increase. Well, the glaciers don't lie Con. But the IPCC does. That's all I am saying.\n\n> 6.Pro didn\u2019t even bother to google \u201cIPCC Sun\u201d, as if he had it would have shown multiple resources and links to reports that analyze the suns impact.\n>\n> The first 4 links are from the 4th annual report, which factors associated with the sun was mentioned in detail in 4 different chapters:\n>\n> - 1.4.3 \u201cSolar variability and total solar irradiance\u201d\\[10\\]\n> - 2.7.1.1 \u201cdirect observations of solar irradiance\u201d\\[11\\]\n> - 6.6.3.1 \u201cSolar forcing\u201d \\[12\\]\n> - 9.3.3.2 \u201crole of volcanism and solar irradiance\u201d\\[13\\]\n\nI checked all references. No page found. There are no such documents. I have looked many times and never found any.\n\nYet another fraud exposed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCon relies on flimsy evidence produced by shonky organisations which make huge profits by scamming people with bogus disaster information which never eventuates.\n"

                "content": "**Clouds don\u2019t prevent warming - as the earth is warming**\n\nData: Pros assertions that the IPCC were making up data was refuted by the fact that the IPCC takes its data from 3 independent sources. This was **dropped** by pro.\n\nGlaciers: Glaciers retreat because of warming. Pro states that they have been retreating since the last ice age. Yes - this is because the earth has been warming since the last ice age, with most of the warming occurring in the last 30-40 years. Ironically pro let\u2019s slip here that was a last ice age: **_How come the earth has warmed from an ice age if clouds prevent warming from occurring?_**\n\nSea level: Japan\u2019s sea level has been rising since the 1980s\\[1\\], it\u2019s primarily just the long term trend of sea level for japan is unknown. This data has been discussed by the IPCC, which raises the question: if the IPCC suppress and invents data: **why did they not suppress this?**\n\nNow, while Japan\u2019s past tides have been higher, this is not true of the UK\\[2\\], the US and canada\\[3\\], australia\\[4\\] and South Africa\\[5\\]. What pro is doing here is called **cherry picking**, where he picks tide data that supports his position, and ignores the ones that don\u2019t.\n\nArctic retreat. Some ice melt can be attributed to soot in the atmosphere, but not all. Pro should provide evidence that all ice melt is being caused by soot, otherwise this should be rejected as an assertion.\\[6\\]\n\nAntarctic retreat: Pro again conveniently cherry picks one study that analyzed data up to 2008. Other studies that don\u2019t adjust for the height of the land in the same way don\u2019t give the same answers: meaning that we\u2019re not even certain what the study said is even true.\\[7\\], even so: it seems that even that is not true any more, as the current massive ice melt that is occurring is exceeding the additional snow fall produced by the warmer weather.\\[8\\]\n\nMore importantly, as before: if all the real data is being suppressed, and only fake data is being reported: why did NASA allow this data to be released? This, together with all pros other data completely refute pros narrative that there is a conspiracy.\n\n**UN got estimates of climate refugees wrong.**\n\nThe estimates of people displaced by climate and weather related events were \u201cup to 50m\u201d by 2010. The real number was approximately 22.5m as of 2015, with millions more internally displaced, or temporarily displaced by flooding and natural weather disasters.\\[9\\]\n\nNot a single person will disagree that forecasting and prediction are not 100% accurate, and pro produces no argument or justification as to why he feels that the UN not accurately predicting refugee numbers demonstrates that co2 doesn\u2019t cause climate change.\n\nThis point should be ignored as irrelevant.\n\n**Conspiracy theories**\n\nPro **Drops** his argument and my rebuttal concerning the climategate emails. He drops his argument regarding a communist conspiracy, and neglects to continue to provide any information or evidence.\n\n**Cloud cover.**\n\nAgain - pro switches from arguing that the earth is warming, to claiming it cant warm due to clouds. Which is it?\n\nAs pro himself agrees that the earth is warming in his previous rounds, and this one where he admits glaciers are retreating since the ice age, and where he blames warming on solar cycles - pro himself refutes the argument that clouds prevent the earth from warming.\n\nAs such, even if it is unknown the specific and exact contribution clouds make, by virtue of the fact that the earth has definitively been warming - that even pro agrees with when it suits him - it demonstrates that clouds can not prevent warming.\n\nPro simply demands I answer a question that is irrelevant, and **drops** my argument for why it is irrelevant.\n\n**Dalton minimum.**\n\nAgain, pro now goes from asserting there is no warming at all, to now arguing that the warming that doesn\u2019t exist is caused by solar activity.\n\nPro argues there is a 200 year cycle of solar activity. Pro has no evidence that such a cycle exists. The image provided in the last round, and by pro this round shows a total of 400 years of solar activity. There is obviously no discernible cycle in the 200 years before the dalton minimum, and yet pro asserts a repeating pattern.\n\nIt is illogical for pro to assert there\u2019s a 200 year cycle when there\u2019s is not even a full completed cycle evidenced in the data.\n\nEven so, what pro completely ignores is that while he is fixating on number of sun spots, he\u2019s ignoring that we can measure fairly exactly the amount of heat that is received from solar activity, and we can use that to determine how much heating that would produce.\n\nIt accounts for - at best 0.1-0.2 degrees of the observed warming since 1970, leaving 0.7 degrees unaccounted for. Pro dropped this when it was raised before.\\[10\\]\n\n**Bad links.**\n\nPro claims the links I provided didn\u2019t work, i invite voters to simply click on the link below:\n\n<https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/ar4-wg1-chapter1.pdf>\n\nPro clearly didn\u2019t bother to even open the link before trying to argue that the link didn\u2019t exist. This means pro simply ignores the whole argument. I extend.\n\n**The IPCC is a scam to make huge profits.**\n\nThe IPCC, the met office, NASA, and most climate research are government or non-profit organizations. There\u2019s no goods or services sold, and no shareholders to generate profits for - so that the idea that these groups are attempting to take in \u201chuge profits\u201d is largely nonsensical.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\nPros has dropped multiple points in the last four rounds, and continues to do so; including the entirety of my first round where I provided evidence that clearly shows the impact of co2 on climate, and **I extend all these arguments for a third time**.\n\nPro continues to change his story, drop his previous claims, and is simply throwing things at the wall to see what sticks.\n\nPro has confused the IPCC with other organizations, claimed the IPCC fakes its data when it agrees with me, yet the data is acceptable and valid when he feels it suits him.\n\nPro has also repeatedly switched between arguing the earth is warming and that it isn\u2019t.\n\nAs a result, the science, evidence and logic clearly refute his position, and you must vote for con.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n\\[[1](https://www.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/kaiyou/english/sl_trend/sea_level_around_japan.html)\\]<https://www.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/kaiyou/english/sl_trend/sea_level_around_japan.html>\n\n\\[[2](https://www.ntslf.org/products/sea-level-trends)\\]<https://www.ntslf.org/products/sea-level-trends>\\\n\\[[3](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/)\\]<https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/>\\\n\\[[4](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.shtml?stnid=680-140)\\]<https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/sltrends/sltrends_global_station.shtml?stnid=680-140>\n\n\\[5\\]<http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0038-23532007000600017>\n\n\\[[6](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140610-connecting-dots-dust-soot-snow-ice-climate-change-dimick/)\\]<https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/06/140610-connecting-dots-dust-soot-snow-ice-climate-change-dimick/>\n\n\\[7\\]<https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2361/study-mass-gains-of-antarctic-ice-sheet-greater-than-losses/>\n\n\\[8\\]<http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2017/05/16/is-antarctica-gaining-or-losing-ice-nature-may-have-settled-the-debate/>\n\n\\[9\\]<https://www.unhcr.org/climate-change-and-disasters.html>\n\n\\[[1](https://skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=58)0\\]<https://skepticalscience.com/graphics.php?g=58>\n"

Global plan to manipulate people with carbon taxes.\n\nDelingpole was among the leading journalists who reported the Climategate scandal, in which he analyzed e-mails among leading climate scientists that had been hacked and posted on the web. What he discovered was a pattern of purposeful and coordinated efforts to:\n\n- Manipulate the data supporting the claims of a sudden and dangerous increase in the earth's temperature;\n- Not disclose private doubts about whether the world was actually heating up;\n- Suppress evidence that contradicted the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming (AGW);\n- Disguise the facts around the Medieval Warm Period, when the earth was warmer that it is today;\n- Suppress opposition by squeezing dissenting scientists out of the peer review process.\n\n<https://www.forbes.com/sites/charleskadlec/2011/07/25/the-goal-is-power-the-global-warming-conspiracy/#6af1ea217c08>\n\n3. Sea levels not rising?\n\nIf there is one scientist who knows more about sea levels than anyone else in the world it is the Swedish geologist and physicist Nils-Axel M\u00f6rner, formerly chairman of the INQUA International Commission on Sea Level Change. And the uncompromising verdict of Dr M\u00f6rner, who for 35 years has been using every known scientific method to study sea levels all over the globe, is that all this talk about the sea rising is nothing but a colossal scare story.\\\nDespite fluctuations down as well as up, \"the sea is not rising,\" he says. \"It hasn't risen in 50 years.\" If there is any rise this century it will \"not be more than 10cm (four inches), with an uncertainty of plus or minus 10cm\". And quite apart from examining the hard evidence, he says, the elementary laws of physics (latent heat needed to melt ice) tell us that the apocalypse conjured up by\\\nAl Gore and Co could not possibly come about.The reason why Dr M\u00f6rner, formerly a Stockholm professor, is so certain that these claims about sea level rise are 100 per cent wrong is that they are all based on computer model predictions, whereas his findings are based on \"going into the field to observe what is actually happening in the real world\".\n\n<https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/5067351/Rise-of-sea-levels-is-the-greatest-lie-ever-told.html>\n\n4. CO2 properties.\n\nCO2 has similar properties as glass. That is, glass only reflects infra red light up to a certain thickness and then it is ineffective after the saturation point is reached.\n\nYour response was inadequate because you didn't logically explain why this isn't the case. Merely stating that the temperatures have risen, therefore, CO2 is to blame isn't adequate or sufficient.\n\n<http://joannenova.com.au/2010/02/4-carbon-dioxide-is-already-absorbing-almost-all-it-can/>\n\n5. The Earth has been warmer previously.\n\n<https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11647-climate-myths-its-been-far-warmer-in-the-past-whats-the-big-deal/>\n\nThis proves that humans have nothing to do with warming or cooling. These things happen of their own accord whether humans are present or not present.\\\nImagine if the sun just suddenly disappeared. The earth would quickly turn into a block of ice as cold as Pluto. Thus, the sun is 100% in control of Earth's climate and nothing else matters. The amount of influence that CO2 has on Earth's global temperature would be so small that it wouldn't be worth trying to measure. Probably less than one billionth of a degree Celsius. Get over it. Its really just a game of politics and control/restriction of important commodities like oil, coal and gas.\n\n6. Seas rising nonsense.\n\n<https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/5067351/Rise-of-sea-levels-is-the-greatest-lie-ever-told.html>\n\nOne of his most shocking discoveries was why the IPCC has been able to show sea levels rising by 2.3mm a year. Until 2003, even its own satellite-based evidence showed no upward trend. But suddenly the graph tilted upwards because the IPCC's favoured experts had drawn on the finding of a single tide-gauge in Hong Kong harbour showing a 2.3mm rise. The entire global sea-level projection was then adjusted upwards by a \"corrective factor\" of 2.3mm, because, as the IPCC scientists admitted, they \"needed to show a trend\".\n\nNote - It only takes one anomaly to disprove any theory. This reference has dozens of anomalies. lol\n\n7. Displacement of 50 million people by 2010 due to oceans rising.\n\nCon didn't find many displaced people unfortunately. He could only find 22.5 million by 2015. Sorry Con, you are late by 5 years and short by more than 50% of your gestimate. lol\n\nToo bad you didn't read the fine details of your own reference Con. The land actually subsided, so therefore the seas couldn't rise unfortunately. That's what happens when you live on the Ring Of Fire.\\\nOh well, you can't win every debate can you! lol\n\nBetter luck next time! lol\n"

                "content": "**Glacial retreat.**\n\nAs shown in my previous rounds, glaciers around the world are losing volume, pro dismissed this as not being down to carbon dioxide: but **Pro** **conceded** **that it was due to warming.**\n\nPro now changes his argument, and says that that glaciers are not really retreating. The evidence provided clearly shows the substantial and rapid retreat of thousands of glaciers around all parts of the world.\\[1\\]\n\nPro is **cherry picking** a half dozen examples of glaciers from a single year - and ignoring the overarching and broad pattern of glacial retreat and asserting these half dozen examples justifies rejecting the idea. Even the primary example of Greenland is incorrect, with simply less melt than expected - not a lack of melt.\\[2\\]\n\n**Climate gate/Conspiracy**\n\nPro engages in a **Gish Gallop**, throwing out half a dozen points about conspiracy without justification, argument or additional details - simply throwing out the claim (as he has been doing throughout), and expecting his opponent to expend energy, effort and word count to refute it in detail.\n\nThese claims all come from a famous climate change skeptic - as pro simply asserted his claims are correct, and they are so broad and all encompassing that it is not realistically possible for me to refute them all - I will simply link a rebuttal link:\n\n<https://climatefeedback.org/authors/james-delingpole/>\n\nAnd assert that these rebuttals are correct.\n\nHowever, much of the specific article linked by pro is that there is a conspiracy based on climategate emails.\n\nThis was already refuted in round 3: and it was also pointed out that there was a full investigation into the individual group.\n\n**This was dropped by pro.**\n\nAs the issue of climategate was refuted in round 3, and the refutation simply dropped by pro. I simply extend those arguments here.\n\n**Sea level rise.**\n\nPro provides links to Japanese tidal gauges, and used this as evidence that the sea level is not rising,.\n\nI produced links to British, South African, Australian, USA and Canada tidal gauges that show this sea level is rising.\n\nPro **cherry picked** data that agrees with him, and ignoring the broad wealth of data that disagrees with him.\n\n**Pro drops this point.**\n\nPro also ignores that even that tidal gauge data shows Japanese sea level has been rising since 1980. It is not the case that the sea level is not rising in Japan, it is that there was an unexplained drop in sea level prior to 1980.\n\n**Pro drops that point to.**\n\nIn addition, NASA satellite data indicates a broad sea level rise, multiple independent tidal gauge data sets - including the Japanese tidal gauges that pro himself sites - indicates the sea level is rising.\\[3\\]\n\nPro must provide a rebuttal to this data from multiple independent sources over different parts of the world. Pro simply **appeals to authority** asking everyone to ignore away actual data and evidence - and believe the expert that agrees with him.\n\nEven so, the expert himself has been largely refuted and described as a \u201cserial promoter of his nonsense\u201d \\[4\\] and, hilariously:\n\n> \u201cand among his claims to fame are that he possesses paranormal abilities to find water and metal using a dowsing rod, and that he has discovered \"the Hong Kong of the \\[ancient\\] Greeks\" in Sweden\u201d\\[4\\]\n\nSo in this case, pros source is hardly credible.\n\nSaying this, if pro believes simply citing a scientist that agrees with his position is sufficient to prove his point, then:\n\n<https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/>\n\nThis is a detailed list of multiple science organizations, academies, groups and agencies who have all concluded co2 produces climate change.\n\n**Carbon dioxide ineffective.**\n\nI should refer pro back to the opening round where I demonstrate the impact of carbon dioxide on heating. Pros complaint was covered in detail there:\n\nPro asserts that co2 has no effective about a given concentration. This is not true, as I explained in detail in round 1, the relationship is not linear, so a doubling of co2 produces a specific amount of heating, but the effect is substantial - and evidence was provided to that effect.\n\nPro **dropped** this point despite it being pointed out over multiple rounds, and now simply reasserts that initial conclusion.\n\nIn addition, it was also demonstrated through the analysis of heat reflected from the earth, that co2 is indeed absorbing more of the radiant heat coming our from the earth.\n\n**Pro dropped this point also.**\n\n**The earth has been warmer in the last**\n\nYes. The concentration of co2 has also been far higher (3000 ppm), and the sun has also been much less strong in the past.\n\nThis is completely consistent with the idea that co2 produces a warming effect.\\[5\\] In this case that co2 in the past had a more significant warming effect which kept temperatures higher, even when considering a lower solar output.\n\nPro then asserts that carbon dioxide has a negligible effect on climate. Pro cannot simply assert this without evidence - as the only two arguments he\u2019s provided to support this claim have been roundly refuted.\n\n**Summary.**\n\nIn the opening round, detailed analysis and evidence was provided about the physical properties of carbon dioxide, and the measurable impact it has on the climate.\n\nThis involved providing evidence from multiple sources.\n\nPro has not challenged the science here, other than the single false assertion that carbon dioxide cannot impact heating which had already been fully refuted in the opening round.\n\nPro made a never-ending series of claims in this debate which he either dropped or didn\u2019t bother to defend.\n\nHe claimed the suns 11 year cycle was responsible for warming, then that there was no warming, and the that it was actually a 200 year sun cycle that produced the warming he claimed didn\u2019t exist.\n\nEach one of these issues he\u2019s raised has been systematically dismantled in the rounds above, only to have been dropped and ignored.\n\nPro makes claims of conspiracy. He confuses NASA with the IPCC and the met office, and the NOAA, asserts that it\u2019s a communist plot without any rationale or evidence, he\u2019s cited climategate, a completely different organization that isn\u2019t the IPCC who\u2019s research has been broadly vindicated by investigations. He\u2019s cited two highly dubious individuals when trying to support his conspiracy.\n\nPro cherry picks data that he feels agrees with him, then claims the research is suppressed, and conflicting data is ignored - repeatedly cites studies, and data sets such as the climategate tree rings, Greenland ice sheet data, an Antarctica study, sun spot data, data on the effect of cloud cover, sea levels of Japan that I showed were either outlined and discussed at length by both IPCC or generated by the very organizations pro claims is inventing data and suppressing inconvenient data.\n\nThis is clearly absurd, and fundamentally undermines pros claims of conspiracy.\n\nIf that were not bad enough, pro intersperses his claims that the earth is warming for different reasons with his claims that the earth is not warming.\n\nHe blames the sun and a recovery from the last ice age as reasons for warming - then asserts that clouds prevent any warming from occurring.\n\nThis is again, patently absurd.\n\nThe remainder of this debate has consisted with pro dismissing data he doesn\u2019t like as faked, cherry picking data and studies that agree with him and systematically ignoring the majority of points that have been raised.\n\nThere is no other rational position than a vote for con in this debate.\n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\]<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850>\n\n\\[[](https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-the-greenland-ice-sheet-fared-in-2018)2\\]<https://www.carbonbrief.org/guest-post-how-the-greenland-ice-sheet-fared-in-2018>\n\n\\[3\\]<https://sealevel.nasa.gov/understanding-sea-level/key-indicators/global-mean-sea-level/>\n\n\\[4\\] <https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/dec/02/spectator-sea-level-claims>\n\n\\[5\\]<https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-higher-in-past.htm>\n"

            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it is supported by the consensus of independent scientific organizations, which lends credibility and authority to the claim that CO2 drives climate change. In contrast, the Pro argument lacks specific evidence and relies on a general assertion about self-regulating mechanisms without addressing the overwhelming scientific data linking CO2 to climate change.",
            "The Pro argument makes an absolute claim that CO2 has zero effect on climate, which is not supported by scientific consensus. The Con argument provides a specific mechanism (SAT data) that explains how CO2 contributes to warming, making it more grounded in scientific evidence and therefore more persuasive.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it presents a clear and direct correlation between global warming and the retreat of glaciers, which is supported by scientific consensus. In contrast, the Pro argument lacks context and does not adequately address the overwhelming evidence of climate change's impact on glaciers.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it provides concrete evidence by referencing independent organizations (NASA, NOAA, and HADCRUT) that corroborate the IPCC data. This adds credibility and supports the validity of the climate change data, while the Pro argument relies on allegations without providing substantial evidence to back its claims.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it emphasizes the lack of substantial evidence for the claims of data manipulation, which is a critical point in evaluating the credibility of such allegations. It also highlights the importance of independent corroboration, which strengthens its position. The Pro argument, while it raises a concern about political motivations, does not provide evidence or reasoning to support its claim, making it less compelling.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it acknowledges the complexity of climate change by recognizing both solar activity and the significant impact of human-induced factors, specifically CO2 emissions. It provides a more nuanced understanding of the current warming trend, emphasizing that it exceeds natural variations, which is supported by scientific consensus. The Pro argument oversimplifies the issue by suggesting that solar activity alone overrides CO2 effects without addressing the substantial evidence of anthropogenic climate change.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it provides a broader context by referencing multiple global regions, which strengthens the claim of climate change impact. In contrast, the Pro argument relies on a singular finding that may not account for the overall trend and evidence supporting rising sea levels.",

The Pro argument lacks specific evidence or examples to support its claim, making it less persuasive.",
            "The Con argument effectively counters the Pro argument by highlighting the inadequacy of Earth's self-regulation in the face of current CO2 levels. It presents a specific mechanism (cloud cover) and emphasizes that it is insufficient, making it more compelling in addressing the limitations of the Pro argument's claim. The Pro argument lacks detail and does not adequately address the potential consequences of high CO2 levels.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it presents a broader and more comprehensive view of global warming by highlighting the accelerated retreat of glaciers worldwide, which is a direct consequence of rising temperatures. In contrast, the Pro argument focuses on a specific instance of ice growth in Antarctica, which does not negate the overall trend of global warming and can be seen as an isolated phenomenon rather than a counterargument to the larger body of evidence supporting climate change.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it acknowledges the existence of solar activity fluctuations while emphasizing that the current rate of warming surpasses these natural variations. This provides a more nuanced understanding of the climate issue, suggesting that while natural factors play a role, they do not account for the significant changes observed today.

            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it provides a broader perspective by referencing multiple global regions, which strengthens the claim of a global phenomenon. In contrast, the Pro argument focuses on local data, which may not accurately represent the overall trend of rising sea levels due to climate change.",
            "The Con argument acknowledges the complexity of cloud cover in short-term modeling but emphasizes that this does not undermine the long-term effects of CO2 on climate change. It presents a more nuanced understanding of the issue, suggesting that while there are challenges in forecasting, the overarching impact of CO2 remains significant. The Pro argument, while valid in pointing out the limitations of models, does not address the broader context of climate change and its long-term implications.",
            "The Con argument provides specific evidence of sea level anomalies in Japan and other regions that align with global trends, suggesting a broader pattern. In contrast, the Pro argument lacks context and does not address the global perspective, making it less persuasive.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it directly connects anthropogenic CO2 emissions to observable and impactful phenomena, such as increases in extreme weather.

In contrast, the Pro argument relies on a single aspect (Antarctic ice growth) without addressing the broader context of global climate patterns, which diminishes its overall persuasiveness.",
            "The Con argument presents anecdotal evidence of observable phenomena (melting glaciers and rising sea levels) that are widely recognized and documented, making it more relatable and compelling. In contrast, the Pro argument relies on local data, which may not capture the broader global trends and lacks the emotional impact of real-world examples.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it presents a scientific fact about CO2's role as a greenhouse gas, which is fundamental to understanding climate change. In contrast, the Pro argument relies on past predictions that did not materialize, which does not effectively address the ongoing and scientifically supported impacts of climate change.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it relies on empirical measurements, which provide concrete evidence of CO2's contribution to global warming. In contrast, the Pro argument is less persuasive as it only states that existing data are insufficient without providing a counter-evidence or alternative explanation for the observed warming.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it provides specific sources (NASA, NOAA, and HADCRUT) that corroborate the IPCC data, which adds credibility and supports the claim of global warming.

In contrast, the Pro argument relies on a claim of bias in data interpretation without providing specific evidence or examples to support the assertion, making it less compelling.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it directly addresses the Pro argument by stating that the Climategate controversy was thoroughly investigated and found no manipulation. This provides a clear counterpoint and suggests that the claims of manipulation are unfounded, whereas the Pro argument lacks specific evidence or details to support the assertion of manipulation in climate data representation.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it directly addresses the inadequacy of sun cycles in explaining the current climate changes, emphasizing the need for a more comprehensive understanding of climate dynamics. The Pro argument, while acknowledging a natural cause, lacks specificity and does not effectively counter the evidence presented in the Con argument regarding the magnitude and pattern of warming.",
            "The Con argument effectively counters the Pro argument by highlighting that the IPCC does consider natural factors, such as solar impacts, in its reports. This directly addresses the claim of bias in the Pro argument, making it more persuasive. The Pro argument lacks specific evidence to support its assertion of bias, making it less compelling.",
            "The Con argument effectively addresses the broader issue of global warming by stating that clouds do not hinder its progression, which is a critical point in the climate change debate. In contrast, the Pro argument focuses narrowly on the limitations of climate forecasting models without directly addressing the implications for global warming, making it less persuasive in the context of the overall climate change discussion.",
            "The Con argument effectively addresses the credibility of the Pro argument by highlighting the lack of substantive evidence for the claims made. The Pro argument makes a broad assertion without providing supporting evidence or context, making it less persuasive.",

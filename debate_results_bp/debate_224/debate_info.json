                "content": "The integration of AI and machine learning into many of the world's leading industries has seen highly problematic issues arise. I would say this is going to be far worse for politics, where misleading information and nefarious incentives will likely lead to the deprivation of choice, of variance, and actual political consent. I'm going to do two things in my speech, right? The first thing I want to do is talk about what we think the goals of political campaigns are, and secondly, why it is that elections address these problems right now, but these processes are likely to be perverted by these machine learning systems. Before that, though, I just want to characterize what we think advanced analytics looks like, right? I think there's two broad features that are important to point out from opening government. The first is to point out that advanced analytics allows a much better understanding of voters' pre-election preferences, and about the weighting between those preferences, right? We have polls to know how people feel about X, Y, Z, but we don't know whether the same person who Our model is then going to be very simple. We're going to ban it. We're going to ban it everywhere. If there's a gray area, we'll also ban it. Any POIs about hypothetical middle grounds, I'll ban it as well. Firstly, then, what do we think the goals of the political campaigns generally look like? I think there's two things, right? The first thing that we think political commands look like is that we'll probably agree with Op that democracy should fulfill preferences and the end outcome is that we want to serve people, but the second function political campaigns have is that elections are both preference-fulfilling and preference-creating. A crucial function of elections is to help people figure out what they want and to better understand the trade-offs between issues and how various decisions will impact them and the people around them, contingent on the issues of others, right? Just note a simple intuition, which is that the reason why all democracies are representative as opposed to direct is because people lack all information they need at the outset to create a reasonable government. For example, some people assign far more value to issues than others. Some people just don't understand some issues and some people would change their minds if it was clear of the effect some issues had on other people. In light of this, a one-person, one-vote system does not necessarily maximize beneficial outcomes without having a mechanism to address these irregularities. So how do elections address these problems right now and why then does this pervert that process, right? I want to talk about three mechanisms here. The first mechanism I want to talk about is most elections have a multi-level structure in which there is a phase where people get to test ideas and then a later phase where winning ideas get used to win the election. Think primary systems or voting for a set of local candidates by following a national list. What this allows for competing versions, what this allows for is the competing versions of ideal messages and even the same message to be fleshed out on a macro scale. People test these ideas in a campaign and end up in disagreements and debates. These discussions are valuable because they allow people to understand the trade-offs between issues that are counterintuitive, not just in terms of which message they like most, but also in-depth analysis on what is politically possible, what other voters want, and how they should balance their concerns, etc. This plays a crucial role in helping voters reshape their ideas and as they want changes, candidates can respond in real time by updating their positions to account for negotiated compromises from the primary based on real-time input to changing poll data, etc. Lastly, advanced analytics makes this impossible because what it does is it identifies people's initial views at the onset and tries to maximize what increases their desire to vote for you immediately. Note the potential for this to go wrong right now. This looks like micro-targeting people who may have extreme views in one dimension and activating them with the most incendiary message possible in a way that turns them off from other candidates before the fact and makes it impossible for this process of persuasion or discussion to happen in the first place. Moreover, it looks like giving people information that incentivizes them to lock in their existing positions before there has been any negotiation. Now before I move on to the second mechanism, I'd be happy to take a POI from closing.\n\n> POI: So will parties still be able to use this data outside of political campaigning or do you completely ban it?\n\nYeah, yeah, we're going to completely ban it. In any way that politicians can use this advanced analytics to alter their decision making, we don't want it. So second mechanism as to how we address these problems, right? But before that, I just want to quickly address one thing, which is I think a lot of arguments in this debate are likely going to focus on why it is that this allows you to make better policy that is exactly what the people are looking for, right? Some type of like oblivious simplification of how this process is actually going to look. I just have a couple like preemptive responses and layering to explain why this argument is so significant, right? I think the first thing to point out here is that in many cases, they are not going to get their best case scenario, which is that problematic policy that reinforces inflammatory rhetoric in conservative localities is probably equally as likely as them getting good policy in areas that have very homogeneous beliefs, which is also probably unlikely considering I would imagine that most places have pretty divergent beliefs, especially where it is politically inflammatory or politically important to win those areas, right? But the second thing to point out is even in cases where this creates more tailored policy, it omits part of how politics is about discourse and preference creation, which is now entirely reliant on this technology. Thirdly, this also lowers the variance overall in politics, right? So the comparative here then becomes that in the status quo, there are processes in which politicians need to use an aggregated platform to react to shifting popularity of different policies to create reasoning and justifications around the things that they support. An alternative in which every politician already knows what they think is the best or an alternative in which only the richest candidate knows what is actually best is a draconian future in which there's less choice in the political system overall. But next, I want to talk secondly why advanced analytics creates an incredibly strong competitive advantage for candidates who use it in the initial instance. Since campaigns have a very high incumbency and early polling advantage, everyone will rapidly converge to this system, right? The first thing to point out is that this makes politics have much lower variance, which is that far fewer people like Bernie who enter the election with a set of issues that nobody is committed to beforehand. This then means that most candidates end up looking quite similar. Crucially, even if this fulfills preference as well, the processes of new candidates of a high variance is good because it provides an educational function that expands on what issues people are thinking about. This shifts the Overton window and brings in information that the algorithm can never access beforehand because it hadn't existed before. Overall, for the formation of better preferences and the selection of better preferences, I am so very proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "First, why this will be regulated and done in a good way. Secondly, why to lead to more accessibility in political campaigns, which evens out of the field and crowds out privileges and the fact that many politicians have a shit ton of money. And thirdly, on to maximizing preference. Let's begin firstly with regulation, which directly quashes with the vast majority of the case coming from OG. A few reasons as to why this will be regulated in a maximally efficient way. The first thing that I just want to generally point out is that the state has a massive incentive to regulate it as well, because otherwise it would undermine the fundamental principles of any which stands for, that is to say democracy, rule of law, maximizing the freedom and preference of people. Secondly, political parties have a maximally selfish incentive to do so, considering that if another political party actively uses this more efficiently or abuse it, this actively undermines the chances to be reelected, which means that they're going to be strict regulations. Thirdly, in terms of civil society, many people care a lot about their privacy. That is to say, their data specifically is used and they don't want to be manipulated because people intrinsically care about freedom or some nations, for example, the UK or USA, or the US have a culture that is engraved on maximizing their preferences and generally caring about freedom. Fourthly, generally speaking, there is a scientific community, for example, that is developing those technologies that are generally speaking very ethical, care about developing humanity in a very good way, generally speaking, are going to again lobby the government in a way that ensures this will be regulated in an effective way. I think the bottom line of this is pretty intuitive. In the vast majority of cases, political parties, the scientific community, and generally speaking, people care about fair elections because this is something very personal to them, because it allows them to maximize their preferences, it allows them to live a prosperous life, but generally speaking, they also have selfless incentive to do so, which means this will be done in a way that allows us first to effectively select out the data that is actively being used, most likely there will be independent committees that are actively checking whether or not this will be used in a proper way, or thirdly, there is going to be strict regulations on private entities that are actively developing those algorithms. Secondly, on to accessibility. The problem in the status quo is pretty intuitive. You are a politician who either by virtue of privilege have a lot of money, or secondly, you are a massive political party that by virtue of existing for so long as compared to small political parties, have a lot of money and a lot of donors and specific nepotistic connections that you can actively use. This is crucial because your capacity to specifically target people, to make sociological-like posts, to specifically make huge campaign-like events, to have a shit ton of volunteers, to actively have a lot of advertisements, and generally speaking, to reach out to people is strictly tied to money prior to the existence of this policy, which means candidates that don't have those connections, specifically the connections that give them money, are gated away from the opportunity to get the same accessibility in terms of political campaigning. Why will this policy be very accessible, or it's on a trajectory over the long term? The first thing that I just generally want to point out, there is state funding for many policies or many technologies that are considered essential for a party or for a candidate to succeed. This is why intuitively political parties receive funding for campaigning, which actively means that the state and political parties have an incentive to lobby to receive adequate access, either to an algorithm that is state-based, or secondly, to finance it in order to have this algorithm. Secondly, in terms of the private sector, there is a massive amount of competition between companies that are basically racing themselves to the bottom to make it as accessible as possible to private agents and to political parties, considering that there is a massive amount of lucrative profits if they manage to do so, and secondly, they want to increase their market share, which means over the short term they're willing to undercut their profits in order to actively ensure that they get contracts over the long term with political parties. This actively means that this lucrative market over the long term leads to more accessibility. Thirdly, the AI, and specifically the analytics community, isn't just about profits. There are massive amounts of people that are very enthusiastic, passionate, and care about values like democracy and freedom, which are developing those technologies and are making it accessible. They're basically making them open source, which actively means that it is accessible, regardless of the selfish incentives of many actors. Why is this important? Firstly, I think it is important because now it levels out the political field, because now politicians can maximize their scarce resources, especially if they're disprivileged and don't have the same capacity like big parties to actively ensure that their campaigns and specifically that the way they're targeting people are firstly more accessible, more efficient in targeting people, which maximizes resources, but second, at the point which they're more efficient in meeting their targets of actively engaging people, this actively means they can reach out to more groups instead of specifically targeting and being risk averse and specifically targeting previous demographics. Now, before I talk about maximizing preferences, I'll take a point from CG.\n\n> POI: You've proven that there is access to data, but you haven't proven why people in positions of power with more capital will not be better able to use that data to weaponize it for themselves.\n\nOkay, but still, if this is accessible, and the info slide basically says that the algorithms are going to be semi-autonomous, which means you require two or three experts, or in the best cases over the long term. Secondly, this becomes fully autonomous, and it can do this on its own. This means that the capital you require for you to hire experts and to have expertise is very minimal, which means that, again, it is very accessible to people. Now, on to maximizing preferences. How does this maximize preferences as OG-like kind of already concedes that this is able to do so? Firstly, it gives us a closer understanding of the beliefs of people. Secondly, it allows us to get more persuasive messages that specifically target demographics, preferences, and the personalities of certain people. Thirdly, the analytics give us the capacity to see changing demographics, and also to see correlations not only between a specific demographic caring about certain values and policies, but also why a certain person who cares about certain policies may also care about other proximate policies, which actively means it allows us the ability to maximize the efficiency of targeted advertisements. Why is this hugely important? Firstly, politicians in the vast majority of cases exist in bubbles, or even if they are disprivileged over the long term, they start to exist in bubbles. That is to say, demographics are constantly changing, but they don't have access to the way in which they are not actively like living with normal people. They live in their own social privilege bubbles, which means they get out of touch or have different privileged beliefs that are out of touch with the preferences of people. Secondly, this is uniquely powerful in actively engaging people. That is to say, persuasive messages are the precondition for you to actively get interested again in politics, to feel as though somebody wishes to represent you, which gives you an incentive to get more informed. But secondly, this allows us the capacity to target multiple groups at once. While in the status quo prior to this technology, certain political parties would only cater to their own demographics and would entrench in those beliefs. Now at the point at which you can do this more efficiently, and you can maximize your resources better, this actively means that you can cater to different groups, which means you reduce the amount of echo chambers. And finally, the alternative is much worse. If politicians don't know what's happening, they rely on populism. That is to say, us versus them rhetorics. That is to say, actively critiquing the character of people or boasting their own personal qualities and sending fake messages, instead of actively relying on concrete policies for which over the long term, you can hold them accountable if they get reelected. For all those reasons, I'm proud to oppose.\n"

                "content": "The first thing I want to explain in the DPM speech is why the construction problem is the most important problem that democracies have to solve. What we explained to you is that democracies should not just be about preference fulfillment, because if they were to be about preference fulfillment, in theory, we could have a direct democracy, or at least we could have AI administer a direct democracy, and we would end up getting the best outcomes. But we've learned that this is not the case, that in general, brute majorities don't make good decisions, because there are certain structural issues with democracy that render them impossible, that we can't get every single thing that we want, because there are anti-democratic features built into our system that force us to have compromises, that sometimes, even if 51% of people want things, 49% of people have a much stronger preference for that thing, and that's a legitimate reason for us to want that outcome in a democracy. And finally, people often have a limited understanding of issues that don't directly affect them, or about the trade-offs between issues and the way in which they indirectly affect one another, and these kinds of relationships, when become aware of them, can change what you vote for, and what kind of policies you end up wanting. So a crucial problem we have to solve on opening government is to help people construct their preferences in a way that is better. And note the practical outcomes of this, right? We think that there are two broad things. The first one is, this is virtually the only way to solve policies passing in the polarized environment that we live in, in that given that people are digging in their heels increasingly, given that in basically every democracy on earth, political polarization is trending up and not down, it's important for politicians to negotiate compromises as early as possible, because if they don't, and if they commit themselves to the position that their core base wants, it's incredibly hard for them to then turn on what they committed themselves to, and dug in their heels on, and say, we're going to work with the other side. So it's only in the instance in which you make those compromises early on before you're elected, and you convince people of their utility, that you're able to pass policy, versus a world in which basically the policy process stagnates. I want you to note that a corollary of this is that the less policy gets passed as a result of this polarization, the worse that polarization gets, because people become increasingly convinced that it's impossible to work with the other side, and that doing nothing, or not working with the other side, is only going to result in things deteriorating more, hence it's better to remove the other side from the conversation. So when they talk about things like political populism being used to exclude certain groups in the process altogether, that is a consequence directly of a narrative that says that we can't work with the other side, that compromise is just not possible. Second general implication of this though, is that we need to bring more ideas into the system, and that crucially requires us to bring in ideas that we were not previously aware of. So one thing I'm going to note here is that AI just does not have the capacity to know our preferences before they exist, right? It can test against available data, but it cannot generate an out-of-sample fit for something that is not in sample, and that is critical, because what we say is having an imperfect politics, one that is a high degree of variance, in which people can say new things that have not been tested at a very high risk to themselves, is the only way to bring in ideas that represent groups or ideologies that previously were disadvantaged for systematic reasons. So if you're coming in representing felons, and felons have not been a huge part of the political discourse, then there's a higher chance that people start to care about that, and that if you can bring other people on that side, you can start to bring about change on those people's behalf, if not in a major way, then at least in a minor way, in terms of getting political compromises that can favor those groups. That is something that is essentially impossible and ruled out on their side of the house. Let's deal with OO's case. There's three general ideas here. The first one they give is there's going to be regulation. Most of these warrants are very selfless and ripped from Matterprep. They say people care about rule of law, and parties want to make sure that other parties don't abuse this. This is not true in the environment we live in now, because first of all, politicians and parties are operating in a highly polarized, highly populist environment, and so there is no short-term incentive for you to try to give up all of your power and essentially say that in the long term this will save democracy. If you can maximize your odds of winning right now, and if your base believes that the other side winning is tantamount to murder, is tantamount to you letting tons and tons of issues that you care about never pass again, then it's very, very likely that politicians opt for that short-term incentive. It's very, very hard to opt out, and even if you think it would be better that you did opt out, if you believe that there's even a five percent chance that the other side is cheating on their end of the bargain, then you're incentivized to opt in as well, just to maximize the chance that they don't corrupt and capture the political system while you unilaterally disarm. That also then deals with the idea that some people care, or that some people value privacy, or the scientific community matters, right? Because ultimately the only two actors that matter here are a. the people who create the technology, for which I would say large technology companies that produce tech have much more of an incentive in selling technology than they do in heavily watering down that technology, which is why, for example, there's about 100 times more people developing AI algorithms than there are working on AI ethics, and secondly, if politicians and political parties want to use it, then they're going to have willing sellers. On top of that, I just think we're very pessimistic about the prospect for regulating these things. I mean, the entire point of an AI model is that it's a black box, is that you don't understand how it gets from point A to point B, so the point in which you're getting to point B, going backwards and saying we didn't like how it got there, is going to be near impossible. Next thing they say is that this is going to undermine privileges in politics. The first thing I want to note is that if we think that this technology is bad when lots of people use it, we're happy to concede that everybody gets the technology and it makes politics worse. That enough is enough to beat the argument. But on top of that, I'd say two things. Firstly, I think that we're trending in a way that makes this less of a problem. Things like free media and social media are making politics more accessible. The correlation between having money and winning elections has severely broken down in most of the countries that we're talking about as a consequence of this. But secondly, and more importantly, even if your algorithms allow you to get an even playing field, then the only other way you can differentiate yourself, right, is taking the insights of those algorithms and just reaching as many people as possible, which still, according to them, requires a huge amount of resources. So it's not clear that this resolves any disparities, just changes on the intensive margin, what strategies people with and without money use. The final thing they say is that you're going to be able to see things that you could not see before. And before I deal with that argument, I'll give CO a chance to engage.\n\n> POI: Campaigns usually have platforms they run on regardless of using this kind of tech. When potential governments start coalition building, compromise has to happen regardless of the campaigning that happened during the election process.\n\nYou're right that compromise has to happen eventually. But our claim is that it's much harder if you commit yourself to a different set of views in the election. And we're seeing this empirically where governments are breaking down because they can't get things done. In terms of positions that they would campaign on otherwise, yes, we agree there's some degree of static in politics, but we made two specific claims. The first thing we told you is that in the process of those static ideas being debated, trade-offs that you were not initially aware of become revealed. And when you become aware of those trade-offs and the interaction effects between things, your preferences change through time and the best politicians respond to that, which is how they win the first stage of the election and get to the second stage. The second thing we told you is that when there's a higher degree of variance, when nobody has the really strong competitive incentive to have the exactly right message in the very first sentence, because if they don't, they automatically lose, that means that people like Bernie Sanders can come into elections and can change what people are talking about, can challenge the existing norm at a high risk to themselves. But that high risk, high reward strategy can often completely change what we're talking about in politics 10 years later and create new issues that nobody knew about prior. This then is what beats the opening opposition final argument, right? Which is just that they say that you might be able to expand people's view of ideas because the AI is picking up on it and you're not. But if you're using micro-targeting, then you're not making everyone aware of these issues, right? You're making specific people aware of these issues. What we explained to you is that everyone has to be aware of these new ideas and the trade-offs between these new ideas, because only that is the way that people can actually learn about how they relate to others in the political process and actually make the compromises that are necessary to keep democracy afloat for a long period of time. We're very proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "The interesting thing is that OG already conceded our case. They said in PM, this becomes lower barriers for politicians to enter, which is bad in their own analysis. But I think the point at which they already conceded this is very easy for us to take this one, but let's engage with their case. Firstly, what do they say? You will be able to change some people's opinions in a worse way. Here's the thing. I want to prove to you why the alternative likely is very much either good for big parties already or just worse for smaller politicians. Why is this the case? Firstly, note that while this is banned, it means that you will go to other worse alternatives for you to reach this data. This looks like you're buying data from social media companies and actively looking at who interacts in what way. Maybe it's not as advanced as the AGI, but it's very similar. For example, if you get the data from Facebook, you can see what people like and this subconsciously shows you how much or in what way they interact with the political views in the sphere, which means that this, however, is only accessible to the big parties because it's, one, very expensive, but two, you need to have the connections in order to be able to do so. Smaller candidates and parties don't have access to this. Secondly, even if you buy that, oh, maybe this is a regulated, even though I don't think in the status quo it is, I think there's another thing which shows why big parties have access to do this anyways, which is they have the money, the capital, and the connections to hire very good researchers who can give them similar data that the AGI can, who are very geniuses in their fields and basically can see how people interact with what. I think to the fact and to the point to which you can do this, the problem is just that those people who have the information anyways, the delta here is whether smaller parties have, this is just if everybody has access to this and basically makes it more equal. But the last thing, you have other ways to specifically target individuals in a way that is not with this like algorithm, right? This looks like, for example, doing rallies in specific regions that are, for example, red states, and you know that the moment that you do this and you go on specific issues that you already know that they are doing because of the polls your researchers do because you pay them good money, you can target them and still be able to radicalize them to that extent. So what's the point here? You can also buy very big billboards in specific areas and still convince them. You can, well, probably control the medias because most parties are affiliated with different medias such as Fox being controlled by the Republicans and stuff like this, which means there's a huge advantage for political parties currently to stay in power. And please note that this is not a US-centric debate. Most countries have more than two parties in parliament, which means smaller parties are very important to get into power. And if we prove that big parties have a big advantage now, even in now the playing field is very important. But I'm going to weigh this in a second. Why is it firstly likely that you will help smaller parties? A few things. One, it's not only that you can see their preference, but rather that you can do the targeted ads for specific regions and peoples in a more accessible way. Because currently for you to buy a billboard, it costs like a million. To do a rally, even more, which means that those people don't have this kind of money and basically do not do this and just go to different areas that is just cheapest for them to do so, which often is not as many people as they can reach and most often not what people necessarily want. So why would this help? First, you are able to reach the people that potentially could be swing voters, right? That's the most important thing, because people who are already radical have no choice. They will probably vote for the radical party at all cases. And the liberals, same thing. But rather it's about the people you can't access, the swing voters. For example, Republicans, that is kind of hesitant and doesn't know if they want to vote for Democrats. Now, for example, Democrats can target those people and not put them in echo chambers where they're only surrounded by Republican ads right now because they're the ones that go to that region. Secondly, you, for example, don't have to go to every city because it's unaccessible for you to do so. You don't have to do those big rallies all the time. Now you have this alternative way. But secondly, why is it so important for those people to get into power? Firstly, they're the ones that most often bring the innovation. OG claim, oh, but once you have this information, all people want to win and basically you will not bring new ideas. Three rebuttals as to why this is unlikely to be the case. One, not that many people get into politics because they want to bring innovation and something new. Why? Because being a politician sucks. It takes a lot of time. It's low paid unless you get to a very high position. And it's generally you have to sacrifice things like your privacy, which means that people get into politics like the newer ones and the newer parties and more progressive people get with the incentive to bring something new, not necessarily win at all costs, which means that the moment you give this mechanism to them, they're better able to maximize it and actively bring the goods that they can, right? Such as, for example, bringing new policies and improving discourse within parliaments and not having just old guys argue about random stuff that young people don't care about. Or, for example, more progressive things because they're likely more progressive in that regard. But secondly, they're the ones that hold the government accountable. They're the ones that actively want to expose corruption and break the status quo. And they're also the ones that are likely to do this in a more passionate way. Why is this very important? One, most of those parties represent people that were never represented before, which is more important than maybe radicalizing a few people that are already radical, right? Because if you get representation from people that were not represented before, you're better likely to improve their quality of life and actively make them less vulnerable in that regard. But secondly, it just impacts more people. Yes, their impact might exist for some people who shift their opinion, but that is unlikely because many people who are already extreme in that regard will do this. Or even if they have the initial exposing, like initial ideas on this, that they might get radical, they will likely get swayed by other mechanisms that big political parties have. The idea is for us to counter this and actively be able to expose them to different views and maybe increase the chance of those smaller parties winning. Even if we get their votes to get up by like 10%, this is extremely important because it gives them more money from parliaments that they get from the budget. But before I continue, CG.\n\n> POI: Isn't it also true that if these small parties have particular weaknesses because of the limited capital, you having access to specific data that can challenge them and mitigate them also empowers you?\n\nBut again, this is the thing, you probably already have this. I'm unsure why this specifically gives you this advantage. But even if I presume that you do, the benefit outweighs it. You don't necessarily get a lot of data. What is their weakness? Because this is not as personalized. The idea is for you to understand how to get those politicians, those people to reach them, such as with targeted ads, or just generally want to know what they necessarily want and you're not going to be populist and just representing the higher elite that they're educated, but rather being able to reach the vulnerable people who are not as educated in an understandable manner, because you don't know how to do this as a new politician, as a smaller party. Now, let's continue with this. A few other things to rebut. Secondly, I already rebutted no ideas are brought. I think this is absurd. I already rebutted why you will be able to shift opinions. I think what the best thing they have to do here is about regulation. They say this will not be regulated as well. I think this is not the case because if you have competing parties, they have the incentive to not give advantage to either one of them. So this is regulated. And also, there's likely to be committees that look this in an independent point. What's the most important here to know? This is that this is likely to become very accessible with time because companies compete, even if it's not currently. But secondly, even if we're able to maximize preference and represent more people, this is not only morally correct, but practically good for people and improve their lives, as well as allowing smaller parties to come to power, improve the political system and hold them accountable. Vote us.\n"

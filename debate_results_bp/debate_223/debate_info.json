                "content": "We place a variety of existing restrictions on political campaigns when they threaten the ability to subvert the will of the populace or increase radically the amount of inequality such that it is not a true election. How will we ban analytics, specifically advanced analytics? First of all, just as a note, we will use these specific forms of banning to prove that it is very, very difficult to do, or if they can still do it, their impact is small and extremely limited. And a wholesale ban is the only way to realistically regulate these things. So there are two main methods of banning. Number one is we will ban contracting with tech consultancy firms and do audits on the capabilities of your employees, as well as the campaign teams of the politicians themselves. So it's very hard to develop insights with large data sets in order to use it. Secondly, though, we will also track their expenditures. So in the same way that we track any political campaigns, political budget, we will ban them from using targeted advertising through proxy. So for example, they can't use Facebook for campaigns. So even if they have these insights, they can't be productively used to target people and they can't be used on a wide scale because if they did, obviously we'd be able to track them. We will also work with corporations such that even if we can't get all the tech consultancy firms, we will get platforms to cut off certain APIs to use a certain feature such that we can't use those tech firms. Briefly, why is this impossible to regulate without a wholesale ban? And by the way, we're also willing to defend the world where it's properly regulated and that's still inherently bad, but just the fact that it is impossible to regulate it makes it worthy of a ban itself. There are five reasons. One, the line is impossible to define. The use of selective regulation for what is or isn't polarizing can be taken advantage of by the incumbent party increasing the amount of inequality and the amount of loss of parity in that election. Two, parity is almost impossible since inequality means that social media will sell it to the highest bidder. Proprietary data sets and algorithms have an incentive to exclude political parties that won't support them. Hence, this gets an increasing amount of control in use in the political scene. Thirdly, fiat is on our side since while public understanding of individual regulations is weak, there is a widespread understanding that generally use of AI to manipulate people is bad. That's why there's a very, very large push against Cambridge Analytica as a whole, but not so much push for a specific form of regulation. Four, its use in advance also improves its ability to evade regulation by becoming increasingly lifelike and imitate humans. Hence, the only way for us to stop it would be to stop them from contracting in the first place or to stop their widespread use on social media. And fifthly, is that the truth is that reliable indicators are just not there. When political campaigns pay out to build better language-generating models, scientists and talent goes away from the truthful net because it could take their job and goes into making these models better and better. We have three arguments in this speech. One, AI impedes access to democratization in three ways. Number one, its use allows it to make widespread propaganda with AI being able to optimize for the palatability of individuals, as well as being indistinguishable from other humans, essentially being able to fabricate social consensus out of thin air. Number two, moreover, fake information also allows it to have the ability to fool fact-checkers such that it is difficult for you to be able to distinguish true information from fake information. Remember, democracy is only important insofar as you're able to determine that the facts that you are debating on or the truths or the platforms you're debating on will actually be what happens in the real world when you elect a candidate. And a matter of fact is, is that when you have advanced analytics to be able to generate these insights such that it is maximally convincing, but doesn't all have to be true, then you have the capacity to fool people and fool fact-checkers additionally. Thirdly, is that output massively increases, which improves our ability to shatter and fracture the ability for people to come to a consensus and just generally know things. Because the fact that you have AI that can generate these things autonomously, you can substantially reduce the quality of political discussion by flooding the internet with cheap, human-adjacent work that makes it difficult for people to come to consensus on common facts and even just be able to do things like make facts wholesale out of thin air. The source of these things is the political motivation and your ability to profit from them by being able to get a return of investment once you get into election and once you get into office. Seriously, we stopped this by making it very, very expensive for them to do so or impossible for them to do so on a wide scale. You should care about this outcome and this argument because the moment that we stopped doing it, number one, we stopped the widespread theft of people's taxes and their ability to benefit from society by making sure that people can't just easily lie about the kind of democracy that you have. But number two is that you also reduce a very, very large barrier to be able to participate in that democracy, which means that it's just simply easier for you to get with your voice heard and have important policy be passed down. But number three is that we also reduce barriers to entry for other political parties because now to be able to play in the same field, they don't have to pay billions out the ass in order to convince consultancy firms to go to them, which means we also improve the amount of political candidates available as well as increase the amount of available political platforms such that people have a better array of choices in order for them to avail of democracy. That's the first argument. Argument number two, fractionalization. We have learned a great deal about AI and human emotion and that the most reliable and strong emotion AI can use to get votes is anger, fear, and riling up your old base. The problem is that AI doesn't just know you better, it can personalize it specifically to you. And when the ability to cater to each individual granularly is there, messages are more likely to get divisive rather than unifying. When Trump campaigned in 2016, he used extensive analytics and machine learning models to send messages to more vulnerable individuals to drum up hate about their particular issues because they could do this. The more you can personalize messages, the easier it is for you to authorize people safely without fearing that this could get to them potentially. Moreover, it's impossible or difficult to just target a few people on our side, which means that you have to cater more broadly to a wider audience. And hence, messages that prioritize one group over the other lose voter basis, which means on our side, you're more likely to get unifying messages and one that's able to unite people. What are the harms of allowing a democracy that may potentially be representative, but is increasingly polarized and increasingly fractionalized? There are three harms. One, you polarize people, which means that they are less likely to come to consensus and agree on common things, which means that regardless of who wins an election, the wins are more marginal and less people are happy and represented for any given election. Two, it polarizes people in such a way that they feel unsafe to vote, they feel unsafe to go out on the streets, which means overall their access to democracy is impeded. And number three is that there is a direct increase in hate crimes because of the increasing inflow of facts that makes you feel like violence is acceptable against minorities. This is a large, generalized and wide-scale harm that happens as a direct result of the ability for you to rile up your voter base in order for you to get guaranteed votes, but at the same time, use these guaranteed votes to be able to harm people in the end. Before I move on to the third and final argument about how we envision democracy, I'd like to take a POI from CO.\n\n> POI: Trump would obviously have an incentive to otherize people without advanced analytics because it's a way to mobilize his base.\n\nYeah, well, there are three, obviously, responses to this. Number one is that it's trivially harder for them to do so because it's harder for him to know the exact issues each individual voter resonates with, but it's easier for him to come up with a message of unity that everyone can agree with. Number two, obviously, it is substantially more costly. He would lose way less voters, for example, way more black voters, for example, if they knew that he was otherizing them specifically. And number three, right, again, it's just a matter of capacity. Finally, how do we envision democracy? We consider it to be an arms race between the ability for people to suss out what politicians are trying to do and politicians to lie to people. The problem is that you massively improve the ability on politicians on their side of the fence to sell you things that won't actually help you, but you believe will help you because democracy is only valuable in its ability to aggregate preference. The massing to the point, what happens with advanced analytics is their ability to manufacture this preference. This connects people's fears, anxieties, and so much more in a way, in a scale and a capacity that with many things that did not personally benefit them. So for example, white American workers did not benefit from immigration bans. Building a wall did not solve immigration crises, but people believe that they would, which means the strength of AI and the use of algorithms is equivalent effectively to a gun or a form of coercion or persistently lying to people with the ability to do that because it has the capacity to be recurring, which means you're constantly exposed to an idea that you are primed to accept. And because it is addicting, because it makes you explore more ideas, it uses the rabbit hole to recommend you more and more content that will radicalize you even further. These are not preferences initially. They are driven and convinced to believe these things and would have not believed these things otherwise. We think democracy becomes a sham the moment you allow it into its hearth. For these reasons, advanced analytics has no place in a modern democracy. Affirm.\n"

                "content": "Panel, that Trump campaign that David mentioned had four categories for how they would advertise to black voters in Florida. The first one was there's no hope, don't bother. The second one was dissuade them from voting for Hillary. The third one was you can potentially win these people over. And the fourth was rally the troops. Crucially, because this debate is not this house would ban political campaigns or even this house would ban the use of basic models. This is about advanced analytics. We say they only get the dissuasion. They only get the no hope. We actually try to win people over. The question of this debate is not whether or not you want ads. It's what ads you want in political campaigns. And there's no crucial things about the status quo currently, because we don't say this necessarily favors the elite because there are different fractions within the elite who want different changes in society. People who have different industries would need to either expand or contract, meaning you either want to uphold the status quo or you want to change it, meaning different kinds of political parties hugely get huge funding. This is why in America, despite the Republicans being the party of big business, the Democrats actually will often get more funding and fundraisers. Crucially then, because of this elite opposition, most people have huge access to funds that can access this kind of technology. But moreover, things like active disinformation in advertising is already probably going to be banned very soon anyway, because of the huge pushes against it in most instances. But in other countries, unlike, say, America, the shame of being caught out lying in a political campaign can be hugely politically disastrous, creating a cooling effect on doing it in the first place. But also things like these platforms in and of themselves, libel laws, and false advertising laws, means it's already not that phenomenon across most of the world. What is the metric in this debate? We say, who gets people's preferences actualized the most within democracy? Why is this the metric? Because A, the state as in its existence is reliant on oppressing you each and every day, making you follow its laws and threatening you with violence if you don't do so. Therefore, it actively takes your agency away. And the only way which it can certainly repay that is by giving you agency control back over the state, retrospectively. Because things like benefits, what actually will help you in life can often be uncertain because you don't know what people want. But secondly, note that preferences and what people say they want actually directs them towards benefit in life. Because oftentimes, say for example, if you are someone who doesn't like handouts, you may not vote left-wing, even if it's the best for you, because you won't find it fulfilling to be on benefits. Crucially, then we say preferences within democracy is one of the most important in terms of people living the good life on the ground. One big point in the speech about uncovering and activating preferences, and we get far better advertising on our side. There are four burdens in this. The power of this technology, the capacity to find unhidden preferences, what changes minds, we say it's persuasion, not illusion, and why parties try to expand their base as opposed to shrink it. But even if a burden where that's good, then the benefits. What is the power of this technology? We say it has the capacity to find things about you, to ways that you may vote, deep values you hold that suggest you should vote for a different party to who you currently do, which you aren't even aware of as yourself as an individual. Because crucially, people's socialization is such that it's hard to find the self. Deep introspection about what I hold truly valuable is something very, very hard. And these deep values and virtues are what you then use to transpose onto broader political issues, seeing what I find fulfilling, what I think is correct and moral within a democracy. Crucially then, because this is very hard to do, you have to defer to those around you. This looks like, say, guys not ever watching chick flicks because they think, oh, that's not what guys do, even though they'd actually really fucking enjoy them, they should probably watch Clueless. Crucially then, you defer to those around you. The power of this technology overcomes that though, because A, there's a huge, huge body of data which only advanced analytics has the power to process. Crucially then, you can use trends. You can see the way that other people have changed historically. The fact that people realize their preferences as they get older and older is somewhat true in the status quo, but we're able to activate that in an earlier age and show people their true preferences earlier, getting more represented in democracy, because you use these huge trends, this huge data, to process how people are likely to change. B, you're able to analyze things like temperament, things which have correlations and causations to the way that people vote or are likely to vote in the future. You find out what deep values people have, whether or not they think loyalty or these kind of different basic virtues is what they see as most important, or whether or not they truly do care about other people or if they are self-centered. These kinds of things are heuristics for political values at the top level, and you're only able to find them out through deep, deep analysis of an entire person's whole body of data. Crucially then, though, because it is what determines that, when you have that analysis, you're able to find out what people are likely to believe in the future, what their true values are, what their true preferences are, even though they do not realize themselves, yes, because of their socialization. Second burden, what changes people's minds? We say it is persuasion, not illusion, and this crucially just takes out everything opening government said, because the simple premise here, if you are inclined to believe something, that is easier to convince you of than something you are not inclined to believe. So for example, if you were all, say, globeheads and I told you the earth is flat, you'll say, fuck off, but if you think maybe that these, say, elite lie to you in certain instances, I can appeal to certain key values to make you believe, hey, maybe the Democratic Party doesn't have the interest of Latino voters in mind, these kinds of things. Why is this easier? Because A, you don't have to change people's minds, you just show people what they already believe in and of themselves, so you're not convincing someone of anything, you're actually just making them realize things, which is obviously a lower mental burden for people to do. But B, it's subtle. Because people don't want to believe that they were wrong, they don't want to be caught off guard and think, oh, I was wrong, I'm having my mind changed. So you have to do things in ways where you say to them, this is what you already think, you appeal to preexisting values. And C, the idea that you are able to do those values versus going against common knowledge. People have conceptions of what is objectively true within the status quo, what descriptions of the world are, but subjective values, these kinds of things, you're able to persuade people with, whereas active illusion requires lying about the truth, lying about the objectivity of the world, which lets you do things like fact checkers, bringing in people, just trusting you as a political party, these kinds of things. Before I move on to the last burden, yeah, ANU.\n\n> POI: When Trump sends his most sexist messages to men and he's most racist to white people, how are people not from those groups meant to make educated decisions when they never actually see the ...\n\nBecause on your side, he sends those messages to all men and all white people. On our side, you realize that is not the hidden preferences of some people. That is not the socialization of the group. That is the socialization of the group as a whole. That's not how each individual's true preferences are. So we get less of that polarization, less of that stuff. That's the crucial premise here. B, sorry, C, why do parties try to expand their base as opposed to shrinking others? Because A, if you went over more voters and you get more bases, you're obviously just anti-fragile. If you use one group, you have others. So you're more likely to survive in the long-term as a political party. But B, efficiency and competition. Obviously, it's easier to, rather than try to persuade some swing voter and dissuade another Democrat voter, if you're the Republican party, you can flip a Democrat. That's two for the price of one, essentially. So it's obviously more efficient than different interests. But even if that's not true, why is things like dissuasion good in itself? Because if no party suits you, you should know that. You should be able to complain. You can say this democracy is a sham. We say you should not vote for people who do not represent your interests. But crucially then, even if you don't explicitly complain, the models will see your frustration. And then another party who also has access to this technology is likely to cater to preferences in the future. What are the benefits of all this? It means A, we get a more accurate democracy, which is good in and of itself because we're weighing at the top of the speech with the metric setting. But B, you get proper catering to voters. You realize that certain voters do care about certain social values or do care about climate change. And you get more action because crucially, you want to fulfill what you promised the voters so they don't think, ah, you didn't actually do what you said. You don't actually hold the values that I think you do. I'm not gonna vote for you again. So you have to fulfill your captain promises. But C, you get things like formally disenfranchised groups out voting because you appeal to preferences which they didn't realize they had. You make them realize maybe I should vote in this democracy. We think this is a good in and of itself, but has a limitless amount of benefits. Thank you.\n"

                "debater_name": "OG",
                "content": "So I think the winning clash on opening half is to determine are they more likely to manufacture preference or aggregate preference? Because if we prove they are more likely to manufacture preference, we win the debate. So why are they more likely to do this? Because they say that, oh, you want to cater to a white base, you want to really get to know your constituents, et cetera. I want to know that these are not usually exclusive kinds of incentives. And therefore, actually, absent the knowledge of individuals' preferences and being able to access them at a whim's notice, it is much more likely they're going to actively seek out and try to know their preferences in order to win an election. But what changes on their side of the house? And why is it that you are much more likely to manufacture preference? Firstly, this allows you to win on the extremes, i.e. people like Trump did not want to cater to such a white base. They wanted to divide people and have such an extreme and passionate base. And the reason this is a strategy that works is to note the nature of artificial intelligence in being able to create passion rather than necessarily catering to such a broad demographic for three reasons. Number one is it's much more emotional and personal. And therefore, the first time you feel like a politician is finally going to listen to you rather than this being a product of algorithms that were directly designed for you. Secondly is that it's more addicting. You're more likely to enter this rabbit hole of such a specific amount of beliefs and information that you cannot be convinced is wrong because you've been in these kinds of groups for years and years. But more likely, thirdly, they push you into echo chambers like Facebook groups, like Patriots for America that is a specifically notable Trump group that is much more likely to make you believe and hear that you are correct, et cetera. Why is this strategic with respect to extremes? Because you cannot win in numbers on extremes, but you can win on passion. You can rely on a 51% because even if you cater to a broad demographic, you cannot assure that they're going to show up in election time. And notice, for an extreme base, you also can't assure that they will show up in an election time unless you are able to rile them up so significantly like Trump was able to do that people were willing to not only vote in elections, but also storm the Capitol. And that is uniquely the capacity of artificial intelligence to cater to you as an individual human being and tell you to be angry, to be mad, to be feisty, and they cannot claim will happen on our side as well. But secondly, oftentimes you manufacture preference to justify past failure. When you want to convince people that the material reality they live in is actually different, you are more likely to do that when the material reality is bad and you are the reason for it. So rather than convincing people that we have to have a new response to COVID, a lot of COVID denialism came at the fact when people were so sick of all the lockdowns and an inefficient government response. And therefore, the way in which you do that is to try and hide all the real facts or at least to a significant enough degree that they would not be able, or rather they would be able to actually doubt the science. The reason that doesn't work on our side of the house is because it's much less addicting. It's much less personal. It's much more likely to hear everyone else because everyone is hearing the same message due to the lack of depersonalization. It makes it more likely to be prone to rebuttals from the other side, more likely that it's not going to be as easy to convince people of these different things. Next, why is it then that this beats opening opposition? Because they just say that you're going to aggregate preference. We think that it's much more likely to manufacture preference. First, even if you think it is still equal in likelihood, which I do not think so after both David and I's speeches, I think when you have a political system that is going to reward the evil use of these kinds of algorithms, because they will have the most emotional and passionate individuals, they are much more likely to come to the top. Even when some people use this in a good manner to aggregate preference, they are far more likely to lose out to the people that try and manufacture preference as a consequence. But secondly, is that I want to ask what a preference is, because what I'm saying here is that oftentimes they convince you that your material reality is not real and that you should be okay with it and accept it because of an emotional preference that you might have, that you're angry and you want to be able to reflect that anger by building a wall, by ensuring that America will be great again, et cetera. There are a couple of reasons this is worse. Firstly, is that even if you have a 51% majority that is going to have their preferences extremely aggregated, the likelihood is because of the division and the nature of that division, that only incredibly personal and anger riling kinds of artificial intelligence can create. It is much more likely that for the 49% that are unrepresented, America is not just one that doesn't fully represent them, it is actively bad for them because you have created such an environment of wanting to punish the group that did not vote for the same individuals. But secondly, is that a lot of these people have end goals in mind, i.e. they want to get out of poverty, they want jobs. And I can't blame people who are simply victims of systems and disinformation for wanting better material realities. However, when they are convinced that that's not the case, it is much more likely they pursue solutions where there's an end in mind, but the means by achieving that end is not going to be accurate, i.e. they get a wall rather than actually ensuring that jobs come back to America. And instead what has happened is the jobs have left America more and more so because of the wall, because of the immigration response, et cetera. And as a consequence, it does not reflect their material reality, but it's much more likely to benefit them in nature. But secondly, I think the POI from CEO is uncomparative. They just say, ah, Trump's going to lose regardless. Not only are you less able to do this to such a great extent, but the problem is contradiction, i.e. what Trump did was he told the rich individuals in Wall Street that people are going to steal your money, that they're going to try and get you out. You have to vote for me, I will save you. At the same time, he catered to an incredibly poor base of uneducated white Americans and said you have to swap Wall Street, you have to take their money back, et cetera. These kinds of contradictions are easy to spot when they are so widely publicized, when they cater to every single group and it is done through TV, through messages, et cetera. But if there are subtle kinds of articles, informations, ways to cater to you, it's so difficult to spot all these contradictions. And I'm only using the most explicit one as an example because it's easy to understand. There are many that are far more subtle that are more difficult to understand. And I think those are incredibly difficult to call out. CO.\n\n> POI: There are costs to using misinformation even if you target it well. The media still finds out eventually and people reveal these preferences on social media. Presumably this means that once you have better access to people's real preferences, you prefer to give them positive reasons to vote for you rather than cheap misinformation.\n\nExactly. So I first want to say, absent this, it's a much better counterfactual. When you don't know people's preferences, you're more likely to want to build a representative government of many groups of people that represent different regions. Because absent people trusting that you know their preferences, you will defer to people that actually do. Or you're more likely to create campaigns that are wider scope in nature and geographic in nature rather than ones where you can simply change the minds of those people in those different geographic locations. But I want to note that the POI from Max is that there are significant costs to this, which means that the people best able to allay those costs and achieve like rather afford the huge database that are needed. The incredibly expensive kinds of people you have to hire for this are the elite or the ruling parties or the ones that are the wealthiest. And what that means is, in the same way we can ban things or enforce things like public campaign financing and not have private campaigns. I think this is similar in principle because allowing people to have more choices is better able at aggregating preference when people can actually make different decisions rather than having the wealthiest campaign spenders rise to the top because it's a strong and powerful mechanism. All the mechanism that Max says are ones that do not work for the poorest parties or rather for the richest parties, but will work definitely for the poorest ones. I'm very proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "I think government are trying to have four different debates at once. Let's be clear on what the actual comparative is, what the motion calls for us to defend and what the motion calls for us to ban. Check your phones. It is specifically about the use of advanced analytics in political campaigns. Note, you have the incentive and capacity for the elite to want to maintain their power anyway, so they will use whatever tools are available to them outside of the spamming. What does this mean? First, this means that the elite will be able to use the tools that are available to them outside of the spamming. Second, this means that the elite What does this mean? Firstly, is you still have artificial intelligence doing mass generation of political advertisements because it's not using advanced analytics to determine what those advertisements are. It's just making as much as possible. It's language writing or AI. Secondly, you still get targeted advertising, but it's a little bit more blunt. So you send your black voter, your black voter advertisement rather than something which is specifically targeting their specific needs and wants. Notably, this oftentimes is built up in rigid social biases about what you think a particular group wants or what you think will be persuasive towards them. This means the deputy prime minister example of Wall Street voters versus regular voters getting different advertisements is absolutely not comparative. Thirdly, you still use simple models and analytics about what is the most persuasive thing towards people in general or a particular group of people. The difference is that it's not personalized towards an individual, right? The world is massively dystopian on either side of the house. So let's compare top half now. Opening government. What are the claims that they make? Firstly, they say your output massively increases. Notably, this is absolutely not comparative because of the things I've just said where AI can still do a huge amount of increasing output. Secondly, they say it's easier to fool fact checkers because of the amount of increase in advertising. Note, this is hung on the same premise that you massively increase the degree to which you're doing these things. You can still have disseminated messages. You can still have AI making 5,000 different kinds of advertisements and sending them to the people that you think you want to do. The difference is the advanced analytics about what makes up those advertisements and who they're sending them to you. Thirdly, they say increases widespread propaganda. Note again, this is hung on the previous claim too because it's about the scale rather than what's in the actual message itself. Fourthly, they say there's a higher barrier to entry here because it's expensive. Notably, this isn't really comparative either. Even with the ban, you would still have the most amount of capital for conventional advertising and conventional targeted advertising going towards those with the most power within society. But note the comparative here because we explained to you there's a lower barrier to entry for doing things like unlocking previously locked away voter bases, which is to say under the status quo until like the 2016 election, like black Democrats were absolutely fucked because the Democratic Party knew that they could always rely on their votes and the Republicans knew that they could never access them, which means they never got things like schools built in their districts, proper healthcare, actual catering towards their needs. Now that there is the fear from the Democrats that targeted advertising from the Republican Party could unlock this voter base or could engage with them or could persuade them, that's when they actually had to start catering towards their things, passing policies about defunding the police, all those other things that you've got on our side of the house that you do not get on their side of the house. Let's weigh up these two groups then, right? The increase in political parties from opening government versus on our side when we have increased actualization and preferences. Firstly, we propose to you that you get at least some choice, right? Because if you get more political parties on their side, it doesn't actually really matter if those parties aren't catering towards people in society. Secondly, get better preference aggregation for all people, right? So the Republicans are also catering towards their existing voter base on a better level now. Notably like most political campaigns are like local campaigns, right? What this actually looks like in the real world panel is that you realize that your voter base actually doesn't care about this hospital as much as they care about building this road in this area. That's what the majority of this kind of policy is going to look like. Thirdly, also like a lot of big tech is quite liberal because there are young people in general who tend towards being a little bit more liberal, meaning they're not always going to fund the institutionally powerful actors. They're also going to fund left-wing parties and just in general, other parties as well. But also you have philanthropists and elites who are able to fund smaller political parties, getting into these kinds of domains in the first place. So on a comparative of their preferences, it seems that opening government has very little. What is the remaining claim from opening government and how are we going to win it? The remaining claim, and this is where the case ship happens in DPM when they realize that their actual counterfactual doesn't really work, is the idea that you're going to focus on manufacturing preferences versus catering towards preferences. So let's run through that now and why it's more likely that our side is the more plausible. The first thing they say is that, aha, anger is really useful in terms of, as a tool of rallying people up. Notably, this is not comparative because if you already know that anger is the most persuasive thing, that's what you put in all your messaging. The comparative is on our side when we're able to determine that for some people, anger is not the best tool for riling them up, but things like hope for a better future, persuasion along the lines of helping out your neighbor and that kind of thing, we can get that uniquely on our side of the house because their side has to be more rigid and dogmatic about what they're engaging with in these kinds of political campaigns. Nor would we then, misinformation is still going to be used on either side of the house, but we would portray to you that on our side of the house, it's easier to do things like catering to preferences because look at the comparative here. On their side of the house, they must both persuade you that the world is not what you think it is and then also persuade you to vote for you. On our side of the house, we just need to persuade you to vote for you. We say that when you can cater to individual preferences, maybe things that they did not even realize yet, that is far more easy to do when you have this kinds of analytics because it means that you can access what opening governments say, the idea that someone is truly listening to you for the first time, truly speaking on your behalf, et cetera. When you do not have the ability to properly do that for most people, that's when you have to rely more on misinformation because you do not have the necessary tools available for you to determine that kind of thing. Before I move on, opening government. is there any reason why you think you might be winning the top half?\n\n> POI: So the problem I have here is not only do you never prove the capacity here, which we prove is mutually exclusive, like the whole point is that we don't give an account on the advanced analytics to know the best way to avoid auditing. Just because you think sometimes politicians can be good, doesn't mean you should give them the tools to lie to us.\n\nNo, but like if your claim there is that you need to regulate it because it can't be regulated, most like human life can't probably be regulated. Like that's not a claim towards why it should be banned. If your idea is that like, oh, it's difficult to audit this, you can't tell what people are doing. Again, that's not comparative. We're using large scale, artificially intelligent generated AIs to like create political campaigns. Like that element of the case is not comparative either. The comparative thing in the context of this debate is the comparative between whether you allow voters or like campaigns to look at what an individual voter's preferences are outside of their social biases, which oftentimes people aren't even aware of, as Jack points out to you, and weigh on that basis, or whether you have to use blunt instruments on their side of the house, like relying on a particular like black voter or like a female voter to do particular things. Inherently on their side of the house, targeted advertising is much worse because it only cares to what you socially believe that that group should be engaging with, rather than what actually that group of individuals might actually want. So how do we weigh up this debate in terms of what we bring you in opening opposition? We put forward to you a very simple claim that gets very weak responses from opening government. The claim here is that when you're able to tap into individual's preferences, their deep lying preferences, that is the thing that is most persuasive towards them because they feel like they're being truly listened to. Opening government agreed with this in their own mechanization, so they can't walk back on it. In those instances, that's what you do. You unlock voter bases who you didn't previously have. You get more people engaging the political platform and you get better policy overall insofar as these promises translate into policy in most instances. On their side of the house, they absolutely must stand over blanket policies, which defer to the lowest common denominator of things like anger, of things like misinformation, of things like drumming up hate because they have no other tools available to them to determine what it is that people want. It's a very simple case from opening opposition that's very persuasive because it pertains to the most proximate consideration of this debate, which is who gets more preferences actualized in the political realm. Therefore, we've gone through this debate and we beg you to oppose.\n"

                "content": "We think, obviously, water is the basic right. It is not something you can live without; it is not something anyone can live without. But then there are over a billion people on the globe today who do not have reliable access to safe drinking water. We think that this is ridiculous, and this is a problem that must be overcome. We are proud to come on the government side and tell you how to solve. We're going to talk about how and why we think that just principally, water should be viewed as a global resource. Then we're going to talk about overcoming scarcity. And lastly, we're going to talk about forcing developed nations to care about the fact that underdeveloped nations are suffering from thirst and not having enough water. Well, in terms of mechanisms, this can be like an arm of the UN, like a large international body. All countries are going to be members of it, and you're going to have, you know, two-thirds of the countries need to vote in order to make the decisions. Basically, the type of things that they're doing is to pass a yearly water budget, which says how much water each country is allowed to use, which water one country has to pass to another country, which is on the same continent in order to meet that budget, make sure that it is distributed equally. Obviously, they can respond to crisis as these crises come along. And these are going to be the main things that this body does. Yes, your clarification?\n\n> POI: Just to clarify, if countries refuse to give up their water resources, does this international body go to war with them?\n\nSo we think that this is probably unlikely, but we think economic sanctions are not having trade deals with those people and applying all the pressures that you usually apply in international law is relevant. We think that obviously, this doesn't work in 100% of cases. But as we see with international law, it works in many, many cases. And we think that probably this is still better than the status quo. Let's talk about why we think water is just principally a worldwide business. So first of all, just this is kind of like going back to third grade science class, but we did something that should be stated, water is not something that is within one's borders, right? Like, clouds go over borders, rivers go over borders, seas go over borders. And we think that the thing is that nobody has ownership of the water, because if I pollute the water, then the nation downstream for me also has to deal with that pollution. If I take too much water out of the aquifer, that means that this salination that happens to the water also affects all the countries that are bordering me. If I just take too much water out of the river and none of the water arrives at the next time, that is obviously something that has no borders. And we think it makes no sense for countries to have so much power over the water resources of other countries without them having any ability to do it. And we also think that obviously, as we stated, water is a very basic human right. People cannot live a healthy life or cannot live at all if they don't have access to water or clean water. We think that the thing is that the international community today doesn't give a good enough response to the fact that this water is not distributed equally. So let's talk about, first of all, overcoming scarcity. Why? Because we think that we need to understand that scarcity of water, we may not realize this living in our developed nations, but it's a huge problem in the world, right? One, you have many areas that are just dry areas. Naturally, you have a lot of deserts and things like that. You have deforestation, which makes the deserts much larger and makes the rainfall much smaller each year. This is something that is coming massively worse as a result of climate change, because often you see that areas are becoming drier and have less water than they used to have in the past, right? And we also think that we need to realize water is a resource that is very easily destroyed, right? We think that pollution and things like that very, very easily take a body of water that was drinkable and make it something that you can no longer drink. This is also something that we are seeing. Now, we think that the thing is that when you have an area that has this scarcity of water, that means that countries are going to try to keep the water to themselves and prevent other countries from taking this water, right? And we think that, so for example, this is like taking too much water out of the equator, not caring about the fact that we salinate the water of the country across your border, taking too much water out of the river so the river doesn't flow, into diverting the river into your own country like Syria tried to do once, right? So we think that the thing is that once we have an international body that takes care of this, the vision is going to be much more equitable, making sure that there is not one country who is just taking away all the water and essentially killing the other country. We also think that often you see that there are large disputes over water, and today they're just disputes between two countries, right? And the international community isn't involved within them. We think that we've seen many of these things in the Middle East and even in Israel, where a lot of the conflict with Syria and with Jordan was about the fact that water was not distributed equally between these countries. And we think that the thing is that when you have an international body that is mediating those, then it does become something that is much less likely to devolve into war, much more likely to be solved. We think that this is exactly the logic of international law, when all the countries are part of this agreement and someone breaks it, this is an international agreement, suddenly you're breaking something that is involving all the different countries, then there's much more likelihood they're going to sanction, you're going to make sure that you actually obey the laws of the agreement, because the cost of disobeying goes up at that point where everyone is involved with it together. And before we continue to talk about how we affect the Western world, yes, CO?\n\n> POI: Why will this international governance body not be hegemonized by the great powers like the UN, the World Bank, the IMF, all of those?\n\nSo we think that, first of all, the majority of countries in the world are developing countries, and at the point where you get one vote for one country, that seems very unlikely that the Western world is just going to control everything, but we also think that, yeah, that's the main, we just don't know how they're going to take over, given the mechanism we set up. So we think that, look, first of all, we need to realize that water can be transferred technologically from one place to another, it is very easy to build pipes, and even, there are many places where water is just stored in large stacks and brought to places, for example, in the south of Jordan, they don't have pipes that can still get water to the population, just using very, very big tanks of water and bringing it, so we think that if one country is very rich in water, there is no problem to transfer that water to other countries that are overall poor in water, right? Now, we think that, as we said, because developing countries are the majority of the world, and given that each country gets one's vote, it's very likely that they do have a lot of power within this body. That means that they can demand that if the Western world is causing pollution, or if there is a lack of water in one country, the other countries need to make up of it by giving up all their own water and giving that water to the other nations, right? And we think that that means that now the lack of water in the developing world becomes a problem for the developed world as well, right? Because they're going to lose their own water, which they need for drinking and industry and so on and so forth. What does this mean? First of all, it means that there's much stronger incentive for regulation against polluting the water of the developing world. We think that often it is a Western company that is destroying the water resources in developing nations today, and there's no repercussions for it. This actually creates a repercussion that they're not willing to just stay, because again, water is such a crucial resource. And we think that secondly, it means that they have much more incentive to use their economic power and their academia power and all the power that they have to develop better desalination, develop better technological solutions for places that are dry. We think this probably solves a lot of the problems of people who don't have drinking water today, for all these reasons, proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "I will be having two points in my speech. Firstly, I'm going to talk about why we think that such a body would on average be worse at managing water than the national governments that are doing it today, even though we fully confess they're not doing such a great job. And that's why I would exacerbate the water crisis, including stealing the closing team's point about how it would be hegemonized by world powers. And the second point, I'm going to be talking about the rights to property, how this undermines that right. Before I get onto that, some refutation, the most important of which is the following. What we heard from the opening team is that currently there is an inequitable distribution of water in the world, and an international body is more likely to be the one to do the job. And that's why we're more likely to distribute the water equitably. We feel this is a shockingly na\u00efve take from a team we happen to know consists of two very intelligent young people. And no analysis has been presented to us as to why it is the incentives of the majority of countries, leaving aside being hegemonized by powerful countries, which I'll get to in a second, but even if all countries are voting equally and nobody's putting pressure on anyone else, why would the majority of countries in favor of an equitable distribution of the water in some aquifer on the other side of the world, or an equitable distribution of water in some river that flows through two countries, that most of the countries voting on that topic don't care? No, they will follow their own incentives. If they happen to be backing one of those countries in the area for other reasons, for other economic or diplomatic or military reasons, that is the one that will get the backing. The outcome will be less equitable, not more. We would really like a lot more analysis on this point from Miriam. Moving on. Nope, you know what, that's it. My second speaker will do the rest of my analysis. That's my reputation, on to my constructive material. So first, let's talk about why we believe that this would lead to worse management than the current state of affairs. There are three mechanisms by which we believe this would happen. Firstly, we feel this introduces more potential power dynamics that can be exploited to get to inevitable solutions. For example, under status quo, Ethiopia and Egypt both draw from the Nile, and the Nile flows to the north, meaning it flows through Ethiopia first, and then through Egypt. Egypt is much bigger and more powerful than Ethiopia, which means Ethiopia can't do whatever it likes to the Nile, can't just throw how much pollution it wants into it, or divert it entirely, because if they do that, Egypt will eventually get pissed off and invade them, and Ethiopia really doesn't want that. However, being upriver of Egypt does give it some amount of bargaining power, so it can make some use of that water for its own citizens, which is great. However, as soon as you throw in this mechanism, then whoever has more allies on the international stage, winds up with complete legal rights to do whatever they like with that water, because the international bodies will rubber stamp whatever it is they want to do. And in this case, that is definitely going to be Egypt, because power tends to consolidate. That country in a given area that has more money, a bigger military, a larger population, sometimes a better diplomatic standing, and so on, will also be the one that has most international allies, and therefore, in most of these conflicts, the international body will go with them. Secondly, bird's-eye management by bodies like the United Nations is often shockingly idealized, not in the sense of following moral ideals, but in the sense of following broad principles, whether or not they are applicable to the case at hand, right? And if we see the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that includes, well, also including lots of fantastic things, also includes lots of really specific things about labor laws, like everyone has the right to days off, and children shouldn't have to work and all that, all of which have been correctly criticized by many economists for being very naive to apply to developing economies that cannot necessarily afford to grant them. More than that, we're not sure what the incentive, again with the incentives, for representatives of people at the international bodies, at the international body giving a vote on water issues, to actually learn what vote on the water would actually be best for most people. They will vote according to philosophical principles that best reflect their own country's view on the matter, because that's the thing with people back home, want to hear that they did. And thirdly, right, now world powers can turn off the tap on you if you pick them off, right? So as of right now, everything that happens in the United Nations is subject to veto by the United Nations Security Council, leaving aside the question of whether OG can just fiat that away for the purpose of this debate, right? It is certainly the case that world powers have lots and lots of influence on other countries through a whole lot of mechanisms, right, economic and military and diplomatic, and so on, right? So right now, right, if you annoy, say, Russia or China or the United States, then they can lean on you with economic sanctions and all of their allies, including all the smaller allies of theirs that might exist in your area and want to pandage them, will go along with it and that will have to be you. But tomorrow, they can turn off your water, right? And that leaves some more people being left without water. Moving on, let's talk about sovereignty, right? Because what we heard from the proposition so far is that water crosses borders and therefore it doesn't really belong to everyone. So on this, let's analyze this. Firstly, obviously, this simply isn't true of all water sources, right? Obviously, like there's lots of lakes and aquifers and rivers that contain entirely within the border of a single country. And the idea that like, oh, you know, that's because it all comes from rainfall, ultimately, well, like by that logic, dirt ultimately all comes from like the lava magma flow under the ground. This is a silly philosophical point. So we say by analogy to land, right, we don't think it would be reasonable to have a UN body that could just take one country's land and say, you know what, this is no longer yours for now. I will take closing as a POI.\n\n> POI: Yes, what would be the countries in the world who would have more power? And what would you believe that their incentives precisely would be? Not which wouldn't they be, but rather what would they be?\n\nI'm sorry, I didn't understand the point of information. Like I understand the incentives of each country is to try to do its best for its own citizens, right? And when countries disagree over what to do with the water source that crosses borders, they try to figure that out between them in a way that leaves nobody, where each country tries to make sure none of its own citizens are left with nothing to drink, which we think is good. Moving on, a country is the one that put in all the work that made that water source accessible and usable to anyone, right? So aside from building the actual pumps or desalination plants, right, they also built the roads that brought the machines to build those pumps and educated and protected from crime the people who built and operated those things. This is the whole point of having countries, that you can have a sphere of interest that is yours to defend. And having done that, everything in it is yours. And this violates that critical principle of sovereignty on which all modern international relations is based. And for those reasons, we beg to oppose.\n"

                "content": "Strong and powerful countries, just like older brothers, get their way no matter what. But at the end of the day, the question is, do we prefer for them to get their way through war, through violence, or do we prefer for that to be a reasonable situation in which they have collaborated, in which they have decided on criteria, in which there is an international check and balance that is likely to end with sanctions and not with troops on the ground? We think this is a much better situation. And I'm going to go out, delve into this much more deeply when we talk about the incentives, about the way that international law works right now, and isn't just always only for the benefit of the powerful and why they balance each other out. Before that, let's do a couple of responses to the things that we got. So one, they tried to tell us, look, the status quo is just fine. I mean, look, for Egypt and Ethiopia, it works out great. And so that's totally fine. Okay, that's one example. Let's take another one. Israel happens to be much stronger than Syria. They managed to take a lot of their water and pollute a lot of their water and ensure that they don't have access to it. And then they had a literal civil war over a lack of enough water inside the country. The fact that Joseph can give me one example of where it's not a problem doesn't mean that this problem doesn't exist. It doesn't mean that all the problems that it tells you about, about why it is that right now, there are billions of people who literally don't have access to drinking water, why a lot of these poorer countries just don't have the ability to grow the crops, to feed their families, that there are massive famines happening around the world because of this issue, and about how it's going to be exacerbated. None of the things that Joseph talks about actually responds to this issue. We have massive impact standing about literally saving people's lives on our side of the house that he just chooses to ignore. Not cool. Then we get on to the second thing where they try and tell us, look, I'll deal with it where they're going to vote wrongly and et cetera in a second, but in my incentives point, but then they run into this idea of telling us, no, no, it's sovereignty. I have my, I have a right to it. And so it's just like, if I made, I gave you access to it, then it means that you don't get to control. Several responses to this. One, this is incredibly unresponsive to the fact that water is uniquely something that you, what you do affects everyone else in terms of the way in which you take it out of the ecosystem, in terms of the way in which you pollute it, it goes downstream in terms of the way of the likelihood of it crossing borders of being moves around a very little bit versus the amount of water and the extent to which you are affecting other people. You don't have full right to it. Second of all, we tell you that is a basic right. And we think that even if you should have some right to it in some manner, we think of the second, you are stealing people's ability to live their lives. They literally cannot feed their families. That just trumps your right to sovereignty. We think that your right to sovereignty is limited to the extent that you are not giving people their basic humanity. We think that that stands as a better thing. Thirdly, we tell you that even if you are the one who gets left, just like any other agreement, right, insofar as you can say, hey, I'm going to take this action to build this well, to give more access to water, that if you want me to do that, you better increase my water quota a little bit so that we do that. We think that that is reasonable. We think that is the way that is likely to play out since everyone wants the pie to get bigger. And you're just going to have to give some of that extra water that you've done in building that extra aquifer and ensuring that there's more access to it also to other countries. We don't think that that's a problem. We think that is how things work right now. And we don't see why this is an issue there. Then let's get on to why we think all of the things that came out of OPP as to why this is going to be problematic. First, they're trying to tell us people will just do things badly because no one knows anything and they'll just vote the way their country wants them to. We don't understand why it is unlikely that in this situation, most people, if they don't have like a strong incentive, and we'll get about the proxy rules and et cetera in a second, they don't have a strong incentive or care about a specific dispute happening between two countries, they're just going to listen to the many experts that are going to be hired by this, by this, by this, like by this body, that's the word I'm looking for, by this body that obviously are going to exist. We think that under that situation, no one in the USA is going to be like, no, I ideologically care whether you choose one way or the other way on this dispute between these two random countries that I've never heard about. We think that is the likely case. The more interesting case are the things I just want to talk about, both I'm closing on to talk about, in terms of talking to me about their incentives and why it is that they're going to create hegemonies. So let's talk about why it is that international law ever works and what it is that is created. Several things to talk about here. One, we think that your basic incentive is to create norms. That is to say, there are a lot of disputes that are going to likely be similar amongst many different countries. What happens if you put upstream versus downstream, the percentage of waters that go between countries, blah, blah, blah. This isn't a question of any specific dispute that gets adjudicated, but the general idea of general norms that happen. This is going to be true because strong countries incentives and poor countries incentives are often very similar here, because they are likely to be entering similar disputes that have similar situations that happen across countries. Your incentive is to create those norms and to ensure they are reasonable. Second of all, we tell you that that means you create clear criteria that everyone can follow. Secondly, we tell you, we think that what happens is you create, given that a massive percentage of these countries are in credit, of the countries that currently have voting power are the poor ones who are not, do not have any other power in this status quo. The likelihood of having more power on this body versus if you don't give them a voting power is much, much greater, because they're going to be pressured through all the economic sanctions and all the things and all the hegemony that everyone is talking about in this debate, any way to give up their water, any way to take certain actions for these countries, they have the same power on both sides of the house. Here at least, we're giving them a literal vote, and the reason that a lot of these countries that currently are too poor to buy the water are the ones that vote is because when you don't have water, that is when your economy goes to shit, and that is when everything is terrible. That is not just what happens to be the case, it is a likely situation in which we're giving these countries more relative power versus if they just didn't have access to this at all. Thirdly, we tell you what happens is that hegemonies balance each other out, because it's not the case that just all of the big countries, China and the USA and Russia all have exactly the same incentives and all the same allies in the same countries that they want to protect, which means that given that they know this, they have an incentive to be reasonable and incentive to put up the pie in a reasonable manner. And that means that what you lead to is reasonable ideas of division across countries. We think this is incredibly important and incredibly helpful. I have a fourth reason. But first, I'm going to take opening. Do you have a POI?\n\n> POI: You have said that life is more important than sovereignty. I have to ask you, many countries have an inefficient health care system that leads to lots of people to die. Would you put all health care systems or hospitals everywhere under the control of the United Nations?\n\nLook, like, we think that if you really were to show us that for some reason, this was going to be a much better plan, it would save many more people's lives and etc, then maybe we would, we would force you to give out medicines to other countries. Sure, we don't have like a stronger thing against that. Cool. Okay, let's keep talking. Fourthly, we think that a lot of these strong powers right now are powers that actively care about other people and have the incentive to, that's to say that the European Union puts on its, wow, words in Hebrew in my head once again. Anyway, their ideology is about like helping other people and showing themselves as being the most amazing and progressive. Same with the United States and a number of institutions. These are powerful countries whose people inside of them care. Why is this really, really important? Because there's a very big difference between saying right now, oh, I like there is a famine going on and we are not actively helping, we're not actively giving out technology, we're not actively caring about them. There's many people care about to an extent, but not that much. We think that if in the council you are actively voting and telling your allies to vote against an equitable reform, people can come out with signs and pictures of people dying on the streets and saying, look what your government voted for. They voted to not give these people water. There are strong countries right now who are set, who have a lot of other satellite countries that are going to care about that. That means that we're solving a lot of the problems that we talk about in terms of the famine, in terms of the development of technology, in terms of ensuring that we get more disputes that end in sanctions and less disputes that end in war. For all these reasons, please propose.\n"

                "content": "Two parts to this speech. Firstly, on sovereignty, why the moral principle that OG stand out is ridiculous. And regardless of what happens at the end of this debate about where the water is going to be found, this loses them this debate and also wins us the debate. And secondly, I'm going to talk about where water is going to be better managed and why we help developing countries in a better way. Let's start with sovereignty. Joseph already gives you the vast majority of the world. Okay. What are the responses we get to how this shouldn't be a matter of sovereignty? A few things. One, they say, look, water is global because clouds can move from one place to another, right? So it doesn't matter. Okay. Storing water is something that is unique to the river that is found in a specific country, right? And therefore it belongs in country. I think OG would agree that land is something that belongs to countries and other countries should not have exclusive control over like they're giving over water. So this is just like land, right? I mean, they can, according to their logic, like land has come from the atmosphere and from the big bang, et cetera. And because it has reached this area through something that is global, we should give countries right over that. We don't think that's great. Then they say, oh, look, it's something that is a basic right and therefore it should be global. We don't accept this, right? Land is also something that might be a massive right, right? If a country has famine and like another country, if we just take away 20% of that country's land and plant crops in that and give that food to individuals, we think it's also something that saves more people's lives. But we think the vast majority of you guys would agree that having an international body that manages each and every country's land, that can just take away a slice of a country's land, regardless of even if there was something like a conflict or war, or just the mere fact that utilitarian that would be something that's more helpful to other people, that would be insane, right? Because we value sovereignty of countries as a principle that regardless, that they're like, that all like, if you ignore very extreme circumstances, like when you have war, right? Like, you simply do not take away from countries and it's a non-utilitarian concept, right? Why do we have that? Because even though we acknowledge that like property and the things being in one country or another is something that to an extent is morally arbitrary, right? First of all, the country that that thing exists in uniquely has an ability to preserve or not preserve that thing. And therefore is more responsible to that and you have more override over them. But secondly, it's simply a closer approximation of who in the larger moral sense owns this thing morally, right? Whether it's water or land, right? Because the people are geographically closer to that, right? This just beats the question of how much better management you have, right? On the mere fact, this is something that belongs to that country. If they want to justify just pulling every sort of human resource that the country has into one large UN-like pool and distributing that to each and every country that belongs to the largest sense, right? Because they haven't given us, because of the rebuttal, I've just given you why this is unique to water and we think they're being completely utilitarian and this is something that should not stand. Essentially, this water belongs to those countries and you should not take that away and that alone should win us the debate. Okay, now let's talk about where this is going to be better managed because I think we'll win this clash as well even though it's less important. Okay, look, Miriam tries to give you a few reasons as to why this is like this international body, unlike every other international body, which as Joe told you, pretty much suck, have a good incentive to protest. And the reasons she gave us, again, weren't unique in any way to this specific body. Let's deal with them one by one. One, she says, look, there's an incentive to have norms and to have clear criteria because I know as a large country that it might come back and bite me in the ass if I do not approach this. We think this is completely untrue and you just have to look at how the UN operates right now to realize how hypocritical and unclear the criteria are right now. The fact that the UN Security Council constantly says bad things and vetoes things against Israel even though many other countries in many similar circumstances have done similar things and don't get a video. Because why is there not the incentive that Miriam talks about? Because the big countries, because of all of the analysis that Joe told you, know that it's not going to come back and bite them in the ass because they have so much more political power to defend themselves when it happens. So they're okay with doing things that are beneficial for them politically in the short term. Then secondly, they say, look, hegemonies balance each other out. And this is something that's good. One, this might be true when the dispute is between America and China, which doesn't make sense because America and China don't have a real process between them. But most small countries aren't that close with either hegemonical power, right? At best, it is likely to be true about one country and not the other. So it's unclear to me why that matters. But secondly, not all hegemonical powers are as powerful in the UN, right? The US has significantly more political in that body, as we all know, and therefore it is likely to skew decisions over to the way that is most helpful. But now let's talk more in depth why the incentive of this body are likely to be massively problematic. One, because it's massively large and bureaucratic. This means that it's impossible to have effectively accountability processes over this body. So the ability of countries and officials to make soft threats over other countries, the ability of even corruption to occur, like we know happens to a large extent in a lot of international bodies, is very small. Secondly, it hugely depends on political power. OG try to solve this by saying, oh, it's two thirds of the countries will have to vote, so it's democratic. No, but obviously the US has a massive influence on what the votes of the 90% of the countries over there are going to be, right? So it's massively skewed to the countries that has more political power. Thirdly, populism and separation. Note that we live in an era in which Donald Trump is the president in the United States, and there are tons of populist leaders that occur in many countries over the world. So they're likely to prioritize their small political interests in something that is going to benefit their own political, like their own citizens above everything else. So decisions are likely to be massively skewed towards the country that happens to be better, like in a better relations with the hegemony. This means that weaker countries, like Ethiopia, are going to be screwed over time and time again. At least right now, they have some ability to defend their ability to access the water that belongs to them. I'll take opening.\n\n> POI: Be comparative. If these strong countries have the power to apply sanctions and other things against these small countries, they can do that in the status quo. Where do you have more power and less likely?\n\nNo, they don't have the ability to do that. I think I've analyzed this at length that I don't think this is true, right? Like they have some ability to defend right now, we don't think it's true. Let's answer like something else we get from opening government, the thing we get from the first speaker, right? They say, look, water is scarce and therefore countries tend to keep it to themselves and won't have the ability to give this to other nations. One, note that this is also true about this body, right? Each and every country, as I've explained before, within this body has the incentive because water is scarce to keep this body to themselves. The difference, however, is that now, if what they want to say that the larger countries are going to have control over how this body operates, this means that the country is going to keep it to themselves. It's the United States and not the developing country in which the scarcity is actually worse. And this becomes clearest in the third point of Neta, right? Which he says, now developed countries will care more about this, about the water not being polluted, because they are likely to use this. This is a huge concession that the water is actually going to be taken away massively from the developing countries, the larger places have more power. Maybe they care more, but if they're the only ones who are going to have access to this, we think this is a worse situation comparatively, right? Rather there are simply like good incentives for countries to like preserve water because water runs out, et cetera. And we think this is enough for them to be able to manage it well. For all these reasons, I'm proud to oppose.\n"

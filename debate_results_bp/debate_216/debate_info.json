                "content": "I think it's largely due to COVID and other things that have happened in the very immediate past, but we think at the same time there's an end to the COVID pandemic in sight, with massively increasing vaccination rates, and the economy is largely on track to recovery. We think that given these circumstances, it is simply irresponsible of the United States government to finance these projects through large-scale fiscal stimuli that are going to create massive debt and inflation for the economy going into the long term, and we just don't think this is the most efficient thing to do either. What do we stand for on opening government? We don't stand by these government projects being funded through fiscal stimulus, whether that be taking on debt or printing more money. We will explain the harms of both of those things. Instead, we would like the government to take policies such as monetary policy that encourage businesses to invest going into the future, so there's sustainable private sector-led growth going into the long term. There are lots of technical aspects to this. This can be, for example, like increasing the credit that banks can get from the Federal Reserve, decreasing interbank rates, decreasing credit requirements for banks, and also increasing costs that it takes banks to park money at the Federal Reserve, with the goal of lowering interest rates for companies so they are more able to invest. So we're going to put four things at opening government. The first is the type of projects that are going to be funded under opposition, why they are not useful. The second is why private companies in our comparatives are better. Thirdly on debt, and fourthly on inflation. I'll take the clarification.\n\n> POI: Do you support the creation of projects symmetrically in this debate but through other means or do you conceive that there won't be projects on your side of the house?\n\nWe don't support these kinds of government-led projects through these kinds of funding mechanism. First substantive then about the types of projects that you're likely to get under opposition and why this is not likely to be helpful. I will note here for a couple of reasons that the projects that we're going to get under OP are probably not like infrastructure projects or investments that are going to increase long-term productivity of the economy but rather very short-term spending such as just funding more money into defence or just giving money directly to companies. I think this is likely for a couple of reasons. The first is the immediacy of the benefit that you get when you like just spend more money as a government instead of on very short-term causes rather than long-term causes. In particular for infrastructure spending this is a very difficult decision for like governments to make like this is why infrastructure has been systemically underfunded for years and years because the results of infrastructure spending only come to light when the infrastructure is complete given that these are massive large-scale projects that are probably 5-10 years down the line when there's a new administration and they get the credit instead of you but worse in the short term these projects are massively unpopular because deadlines aren't met, they're hugely expensive, construction and destruction are unpopular and people don't see that immediate benefit. I think this is very important given the context of COVID where people are struggling and they want to see immediate benefit to their lives. So for those reasons we don't think infrastructure is likely. We think comparatively you're more likely to spend this money on things like defence or just like subsidising companies etc because that gives you the immediate benefits that you can reap politically noting that the United States has elections very quickly like every two years you have midterms, every four years you have presidential election and so on. But secondly I think there's just a large degree of lobbying captured the US government and so far that like everyone has to run ads and have a very strong political campaign that's expensive in order to be elected in the first place. That's why we see like lots of politicians United States and Congress being very much beholden to these corporate lobbies because of their dependence on them in order to remain prominent after their local communities in order to be elected. I think that shows you then the projects that you get on the opposition side are probably not like intelligent long-term investments in the productivity of the economy but rather very short-term things that don't provide the same level of benefits. Why are the inter-private companies better? I would note the first thing is we think that the context is that we are recovering from COVID and companies have more and more like incentive to invest. There's like lots of reasons for this. The first is that vaccination rates in the United States are very high internationally. It's like 40-50% of people are vaccinated and that's growing. That means that states in most cases are not going to be entering into damaging new lockdowns and there is that certainty that businesses have in order for them to invest. And these circumstances they look they're looking for things like capital right. So in order to get that all of the monetary policy mechanisms that we just described you means that banks are more willing to lend money to these businesses and they are more able to use this capital to invest in their projects and making their businesses stronger. Why do we think that private business is better than government in terms of that? I think the first thing to note here is that these are private companies that are ultimately going to be responsible for their decisions. If you're getting a loan from a bank, if that fails your business is going to suffer. If that succeeds you are going to reap all of those benefits. That's why also we think companies are most proximate and therefore more able to identify exactly what is best, most profitable and most useful for them. I think comparatively like in the case of government funding you have incentives like screw things up or delay your infrastructure project or whatever because then you're just able to squeeze more money out of the government. But also the government spending in and of itself isn't as efficient because it's spent on like political things rather than the things that are most economically beneficial. Before I move on to debt and inflation, CO.\n\n> POI: Didn't you say that your alternative is giving money to companies and then you said the negative case is giving money to companies. How is your case not symmetrical in the debate?\n\nWe're not giving money to companies. We're using sophisticated tools of monetary and other policy in order to increase the amount of money that banks loan to companies so they can invest. That's like what you get in terms of private sector growth instead of government, artificial government driven growth they could get on opposition. Then on debt, why is this really important? I would like firstly to context that the United States has a massive national debt about 20 trillion dollars. That's like over a hundred percent of GDP at the moment. It's only sustainable under the status quo because we've had record low interest rates. I think that interest rates are inevitably going to rise in the future if you look at history but also just like if you continue pumping money into the economy in terms of government stimulus then people are going to demand more. It's also increasing our needs that the United States isn't necessarily going to repay all of this money so investors are going to demand more interest etc. I think even any marginal increase in the interest rates that governments have to pay in order to service their national debts is incredibly harmful in this debate. Why is this? The first is that this is a massive amount of money so any marginal increase in interest rates is going to mean that a lot more of your annual budget is going towards interest repayments. I think the United States spends maybe 10-20 percent of its national budget on this at the moment. If interest rates go from 1% to 4% that's going to triple to 50% of the national budget. This is clearly unsustainable because it cripples the ability of the government to spend on literally anything like social services etc. The point at which a significant proportion of their budget has to go towards paying debt repayments and that kind of thing. I think this is probably the most important impact in this debate because it's literally existential to the ability of the government to provide these services. I would note that these services are essential to lots of people in society including the most vulnerable people within society and therefore we ought to care about them. My partner will elaborate more on inflation. I think at the end of this debate there's a clear comparative between inefficient politically motivated government-led growth and effective long-term private sector growth that we're happy to stand for on opening government.\n"

                "content": "... Secondly, I want to talk a bit about economics. Thirdly, I want to talk about politics and fourthly, I want to talk a bit about the environment. Let's talk about why this is likely to work and get this out of the way very quickly. First of all, I think we can pass this through budget reconciliation. People like Joe Manchin for instance already virtue signal and vote for Democrats because of the fact that there are Republicans from purple constituencies so there's pressure on them to do this and they've already historically voted for Democrats. Secondly, we have six Republicans in favor only four more are needed and given that lots of the stimulus goes towards Republican states we are likely to get them on board. Thirdly, there's already a Republican plan on our side of the house which is like something like 1.4 trillion so we can negotiate with them and even if we don't get the best possible plan we're likely to get lots of money into this plan. And fourthly, I would just note that Republicans have lots of pressure within their states especially because the last time around the government gave away money to people so that they could pay away their rent etc. It was actually a plausibly good thing. Okay, in terms of passing this we are likely to do this. What's it likely to look like? I think opening government is debating an alternative reality where we're going to do defense spending. What for? I don't know what the fuck. But let's talk about what Biden's plan is. Okay, first of all there's a trillion being spent on green tech, there's 2 trillion being spent on infrastructure projects, there's 1 trillion being spent on family support and there's 1.5 trillion being spent on job support. That's the explicit plan and that's the plan that they have to attack not like fucking defense spending. Okay, let's talk about economics right now and over here I want to deal with why the counterfactual is much worse before. I think there was a historical consensus called the Reinhart-Rogoff consensus whereby you know there was consensus that debt-to-GDP ratios whenever they went up borrowing costs would go up and then you know inflation would go up so therefore we need to do policies like austerity. There's a couple of things that have happened which mean that this is just like not a popular opinion. That's why no economist in the world has come out against Biden's economic plan. The first of all is like there is ample evidence of spending after economic crises working across the world. Secondly, there was forecasting and analysis whereby after 2008 for instance when Obama did not spend money on the economy, it was shown that it didn't come back as soon as it could. Thirdly, I want to note that economic growth has increased while interest rates have remained low and this is also crucial for their case by the way where they're saying aha we'll do monetary policy. Okay guys, what the fuck with? Like monetary policy relies on inflation rates. Inflation rates are already on historic lows. What are you going to do? Take it to minus 10? I don't know what they're going to do. Fourthly, there's inflation actually in the short run in our world because of short-term supply shocks. In our world when there's an expansion of supply given that we're giving money to these corporations, this inflation is likely to reduce a lot of the impacts they're talking about. Don't go away. Any policy on their side also relies on borrowing costs and inflation going up. So when they're talking about giving subsidies to businesses for instance, that also relies on giving money to businesses. I'm not sure what the counterfactual on their side of the house is. In terms of this, why do we need this right now? The first thing over here is to note the fact that you know COVID-19 is a problem and they are going to lead to a debt crisis. There's a looming debt crisis within the United States of America whereby lots of people do not have the ability to spend on their rent. Like they initially had the money to spend on it after the government gave them some money, but now they don't have it, especially because the government support has fallen. This means that you are likely to have a housing crisis in the future and there's a debt crisis looming anyways. Your companies aren't doing that well anyways. Now here's what we do to solve this problem. First of all, because of COVID-19 there was a clear demand slump. At the point which we give this stimulus, there's a stimulus to boost demand from the consumer side because they're getting money through familial support or through job support. But secondly, also more importantly, you have companies producing more and therefore have the ability to hire more. Companies right now don't have the initial capital. They are relying on companies and the inflation rates, but what about consumers? If consumers wanted the money to buy what companies are producing, they don't get their outcomes on their side of the house. We get that on our side of the house. The third thing very crucially is infrastructure requires mass employment. You need lots of construction workers. So lots of the people who have been not hired got fired because construction was down. All those sorts of people get hired again and we get people on the job line. So that's the first thing to note. In terms of economics, we expand the impact and we allow the economy to come back. So the economy won't naturally come back after COVID goes away. The second thing to note over here is how we protect the most vulnerable. This is crucial because minorities etc. have been the worst affected by COVID. They also relied on welfare previously to just go through and they require more welfare now. So what we're saying is if you don't give this money to these people, they're likely going to be in cycles of poverty where it's not enough for them to be there. And this again goes back to the economic crisis point that I was talking about. If you have lots of people below the poverty line, it's probably not great. But the second thing I want to note is that infrastructure projects directly impact minority communities. One of the reasons why minority communities don't have companies coming in is because there's very low investment within infrastructure within these communities. But Biden's infrastructure plan makes their communities, like connects them to national highways and so on and so forth. The companies have more incentive to go into these communities and do more now, but they also get cheaper access to goods and services. So minorities, the most vulnerable people are better on our side of the house. Okay, let's talk also about the Chinese economy and why we need this to combat China. Otherwise we will be outcompeted. First of all, China was better out of COVID because they dealt with it quicker. Secondly, China's already trying to outsmart you in things like tech. The first thing over here is we need the money, especially to jumpstart our tech economy, which gets lots of money on our side of the house. And secondly, we have investment within green technology, emerging technology, which gives us the ability to compete with China, and so on and so forth. So this is the policy on our side of the house. We're much better able to compete with China and therefore not get outcompeted on the international market. I also want to note lastly, in terms of the economics point, once we give this money, we also have more ability to tax the rich or increase taxes on the rich because they have more money. There's no capacity to do that on their side of the house. Okay, I'll take a closing very quickly.\n\n> POI: Yeah, uniquely, this financial crisis results from exogenous factors, that is to say pandemic. Can you justify why the US economy won't just continue to bounce back as it already has throughout COVID recovery?\n\nYeah, because again, I told you consumers don't have the money to buy your products anymore. You need something to stimulate the economy. This is like, you know, after World War Two, you also wanted to stimulate the economy. World War Two was finished, but that didn't mean you didn't have money. You didn't need money to bring back the economy. Okay, let's talk about the second political aspect. As you can see, like, I think in this debate, it's really, really not controversial to say that Trump is an asshole, like Trump is bad for the economy, but also Trump is bad for minorities, women, people of color, so on and so forth. First of all, lots of people have been disenfranchised by Trump right now. And what we have is Biden being able to come in and give direct benefits to these people. This is great, because one, Biden can frame himself as the hero who brought them out of it. So this isn't like a long term plan that OG is talking about. In the short term, people get immediate benefits. So we don't get right fingers, etc, being elected at the point which the economic disenfranchisement of people is down. Secondly, I would note that Republicans often frame other sorts of issues like red meat, cultural issues, like trans rights, women's rights, etc, etc. So there's a stupid debate on their side of the house. But we circumvent that stupid debate, because we're asking the Republicans to talk about things that also affect their states, and directly workers within their states that they that they care about. So it's politically better for us. Thirdly, we also want to talk about the fact that rural communities that vote for Trump are likely to get access to highways, etc, which also means that we're likely to bring this back. If this doesn't work, we can always blame the Republicans as well, which gives us a great discursive tool. Hamza will talk a bit about the environment for all these reasons. Very proud to oppose.\n"

                "content": "One, the majority of my rebuttal to opening opposition will be integrated. But before I get on to that, I want to explain two miscellaneous points of rebuttal. The first is on China. The second is on infrastructure projects and minority communities on China is unclear what the marginal changes here and this is for a couple of reasons. The first is structurally speaking, the Chinese economy is on the edge of collapse within the next decade. The reason for this is twofold. The first is the one China policy has created a undersupply of workers within the Chinese economy, whereas the Chinese economy due to its socialist tendencies have debt obligations to a vast majority and larger base of older people. It is therefore going to have to spend an increasing amount of money on spending like social care and less money on infrastructure investment. Secondly, China just over leveraged itself at the point that it invested massively globally. So for example, investing massively in like failing projects in the BRI sector, or alternatively, on trains that go nowhere for political reasons that nobody takes, empty cities, all of these things have racked up massive debt, and a large, decent percentage of that is domestically owned. So the point that those entities fail, because they're not reaching their repayments, we think that's going to screw over Chinese people the most, and it's going to shrink their incomes, and also their prospects of future wealth, which means that there is going to lead to a unique financial crisis greater than just the average cyclical recession. We don't think that China is a relevant consideration in this debate, especially because the one surviving part of the COVID pandemic and the one sector which did well are the sectors they wanted to talk about the technological sectors like the green space, the fact that Silicon Valley is still massively over leveraged, in fact, to over leverage to the extent that it actually is now allowing the financing of bad ideas at its early stage, because of how many investors are in the market. We don't think this is a relevant point in the debate. Secondly, on infrastructural projects and minorities. I think this ignores the analysis that Andrew gave you about political expediency, because if political expediency and investing in projects because of how you want to win the next election matters, then you're going to invest in those tipping point areas, which are the most likely to yield you the election. So it's the area, Rust Belt areas of Michigan, or of, you know, okay, I can't actually think of another Rust Belt area, or Pennsylvania, which are going to get the majority of investment and majority of pork barreling, as opposed to minority areas, specifically African American and Hispanic areas they wanted to talk about where they see the highest percentage of already Democrat voters. But also notice how if it is true that they do engage in negotiations with Republicans, and that is what has led to this plan, then the specific sites in the Biden plan are probably going to be places where both parties feel that they can get benefit. Those aren't the minority areas that they wanted to talk about. Can somebody just put a time signal in the chat? I did forget to start my timer. I'm really sorry about that. I want to talk about a couple of things in this debate. Cheers. The first is on incomes. I think that the reasons that Andrew gave you, you are unlikely to accrue, to a large extent, a flow of incomes in the way that they described. This is for a couple of reasons. Let's start with the company's analysis that he gave you. Given the COVID pandemic, companies have not had the inflows which have allowed them to facilitate the credit that they have racked up. So they are currently in more negative and precarious positions than they previously were. The reason that this matters is because often when you breach a certain amount of credit obligation, you have to do things like pay back money now, you get immediately higher interest rates, you get stripped of your assets. I think that this is specifically true of the type of companies who they are going to have to hire and subsidise on their side of the house when they're engaging in infrastructure projects. The reason for this is because they operate in the construction sector, which has been hit particularly hard due to the lack of demand, because there have been less things like people feeling confident about their wealth, less things like the buying of houses, and generally the construction sector is a, shall we say, marker for the development and the advancement of the economy. What this means is that they are going to have to do things like tie meeting and financing the credit obligations into the government contracts that they signed under Biden's plan, which means that a lot of the money that they're going to spend on this plan won't actually go towards the projects, they'll go towards financing these companies, towards making their shareholders okay, and towards paying off their CEOs. But even if we accept that money gets towards the projects, and that results in incomes or greater jobs, we don't think that is going to lead to further increases of economic growth and further jobs. This is for a couple of reasons. One, as Andrew describes, inflation erodes the value of real spending. This is especially true for the poorest workers who don't have inflation adjusted incomes. Now, the way that they try to arbitrage this away is by saying, oh, no, but we get investment in infrastructure projects, and therefore we get economic growth in the future. The problem for these individuals is they are short term is because they are living paycheck to paycheck. And therefore they are likely to do things like take up more private debt to finance that. So inflation makes things worse for them in the short term, they don't see the benefit of those infrastructure projects in the long term. And the impact of that for them is that they just take on more private debt. What is our comparative? It is yes, maybe on both sides, those people taking up that debt, but at least on our side, we have a better mechanism for economic growth in the long term. So the benefits that Taha was trying to claim, as in those people will eventually get jobs and be good, are unique to our side of the house, because it is private companies who have that incentive to invest in the economy, at the point that we use our monetary policy tools, which by the way, weren't just interest rates, where all of the things Andrew gave you, the fact they don't understand them doesn't mean they don't exist. Very quickly closing opposition.\n\n> POI: Why are they firstly mutually exclusive? Secondly, why are they better? You don't prove this sort of thing saying they're sophisticated doesn't isn't equal analysis.\n\nSure, they're not mutually exclusive. But insofar as they work, we think that it's ridiculous to take on the harms of this debt to the reason that they work is for the reason that Andrew describes, which is one of the biggest problems coming out of an economic crisis is the willingness of businesses to be the first movers and to invest within the economy starting that that accelerated cycle of investment. What we do is we increase credit requirements for banks themselves at the Fed, so that banks have a take on a higher cost at the point that they save their money, or so that banks are more incentivized to loan money out to businesses and individuals, which gets the private sector of the economy booming in a way that government stimulus work. The final thing I want to talk about is how precarious government and this investment is going to be for a number of reasons. The first is even if they are able to get infrastructural projects, the problem on their side of the house is once those projects are done, people lose their incomes and people lose those jobs. And people know that so they're not going to invest money in the economy, they're going to save that money, and they're not going to see the economic benefits. But worst of all, just weigh up everything they say against all of our analysis, the fact that you now have to make greater trade offs in the future in terms of debt obligations, which means that younger people uniquely get screwed over the fact is the poorest to get her and the middle classes who are okay, because it's the poorest who don't have inflation adjusted incomes, we harm future generations at the point we take on this debt burden, we harm younger people, we harm the poorest workers. we propose.\n"

                "content": "I think authority but literally not a single mainstream economist has come out against Biden's infrastructure plan. The debate right now is not whether they should spend but how many trillions five or six. Similarly, Kristalina Georgieva, the chief economist of the IMF similarly said that it's confounding for us that in the last decade, interest rates have stayed historically low, but economic growth has gone up. It's just literally true that this is a good idea. And I blame the CS for this motion. The first thing I want to do is deal with the intuition that it will pass which received no response. And it's going to regurgitate these seasons of CG doesn't strawman them later. If we have budget reconciliation, Manjushri is going to keep saying I want bipartisanship so that he can win his districting and Virginia and then vote for us anyway. He has literally done that for all legislation. BVF six Republicans on our side, we just need four more. Remember, this helps Republican constituents for Taha's analysis as well. But finally, even if it does not pass, they can signal that you people aren't getting jobs because of the Republicans. Finally, their counterfactual is monetary policy. I just want to point out that monetary interest rates are historic lows, like where are you going to go into negative interest rates now? What are you going to do? Sophisticated monetary policy is not a substitutable counterfactual. But finally, I want to say in terms of their counterfactual, if it's true that corporate lobbying is this big, and your solution isn't to use a demand side stimulus, then you're going to do exactly what's worse for your constituents on opening government, which is deregulate the economy. That's what Bush did. That's what Reagan did. Because the way that you get these companies working, as Andrew said, thrive on this private sector economy is to deregulate these industries as much as possible, vis-a-vis the lobbying that they themselves talked about, which worsens all the harms on inequality and versus all the things in terms of economic outcomes. Before I talk about the economy, one extension from my end. The environment is absolutely crucial in this debate. A trillion of this is going towards green technology and environmental development. A, you will never get environmental buy-in unless you couch it within the language of infrastructure. If Biden says tomorrow, let's only spend on the environment, not even Democrats will vote for this, especially people like Manchin. But secondarily speaking, for four years, we've dislocated ourselves from the environmental debate, the point at which the US has engaged in unprecedented environmental destruction under the Trump administration. If you really want to do that typical world schools way up like DPM did, care about the environment in the long term, because it screws all of us, screws the economy and also screws other countries. We uniquely get that money on our side. They don't. The first thing I want to do within the economy is problem identification. And here I find this very interesting. So opening government conceals that companies are doing really horribly. And then C.G.R. in the POI won't the economy bounce back naturally? I mean, you have to engage with one of those, not both. But secondarily, companies are uniquely reliant on long term infrastructure spending. The reason for that is because the last time an infrastructure bill came through in the US of this magnitude was nineteen fucking thirty eight, which means our bridges are crumbling, our electric wiring is crumbling. So if companies rely on infrastructure for transportation, logistical support, then necessarily this is a good spending in the long term. The second thing I want to talk about is in terms of why we're doing this. There are two reasons why we want to have the stimulus plan. The first reason is to do with short term supply shocks. In other words, I concede to C.G.R. This was an artificial stopping of the economy. But what that meant was that when companies aren't producing anymore, what that leads to is them not having money to produce again a year later. The analogy here would be that if I close my store and I'm not selling anything, I don't have the money to sell next year in that corner shop store. What we do is that we stimulate the economy and resolve for the supply shock, the point of which we put in a shit ton of money in the economy. That was the first reason. The second reason that is a problem with COVID-19 is to do with debt arrears. Currently, there are two sorts of arrears that the average consumer in the US has a rent arrears and be mortgage arrears. Both of these were frozen during the COVID-19 pandemic or at least the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic. But these debts are haunting them. They are due in August, literally to the point of which these people are financing those debts or worst case going bankrupt. They can't spend on the economy. You need to put money in the pockets of these people in order to stimulate the economy and push the US economy forward. Before I deal with the third claim within the economic stuff, I'm really happy to take closing government. Go ahead.\n\n> POI: Yeah, obviously, there are many people with savings in the US economy, and there has been stimulus throughout COVID. Specifically, what you have to defend at all is a massive infrastructure spending at this point in time.\n\nNo, no, I agree. But financing dried up like two weeks ago. Don't lie, right? Like, I know it's a bad motion. But don't lie. Like, like all of the COVID relief spending dried up two weeks ago. So people are in the looming debt crisis. I've already responded to this. I'm really sorry. The fourth thing I want to talk about within spending is that Taha uniquely shows you that the only point at which that unique, unique political incentives to raise taxes on the rich is when it's accompanied by a shit ton of infrastructure spending. Otherwise, the Republicans don't vote for this. Joe Manchin does not vote for it either. But secondly, let's concede to the argument. And let's say, you know what, deficit spending is going to lead to a debt crisis. That's when you generate unique political capital to also increase revenue generation. And you do that by taxing people such as Bezos, and hence reducing the inequalities that they talked about. The fifth thing within the economic stuff that I want to talk about is China. And here they had an interesting example, which was the demographic slide means that China is going to reduce in its economic stuff. A, no, that's why they're building foreign markets through the BRI. And two, their biggest advantage is in tech. So if you want to solve the technological gap, then you need to spend trillions within the technological sector. Secondly, even if the Chinese economy is on the verge of collapse 10 years from now, your allies don't trust you as an actor, which is spending correctly. The point at which you start gaining an advantage in the tech sector relative to the rest of the world, not just China, when your allies re-engage with you again. But secondly, note the environmental argument at the top of my speech. They don't trust you right now because you pulled out of the Paris Accord. So independent of just the Chinese concern and concern to the rest of your allies, you signal that these sort of things then matter. Finally, on the political lobbying stuff, the first thing I want to point out here is that they've conceded by not responding to it that getting Trump into office is a bad thing. What do we do? Two really unfortunate but fortunate things happened in the COVID-19 pandemic. A, what happened was that Trump led the presidency while the COVID-19 pandemic was happening, hence his popularity fell. But two, I mean, somewhat suspiciously, the vaccine was literally announced the day after the US president was sworn into office in the form of Joe Biden. Joe Biden has this unique opportunity right now to do something that no president has been able to do before, which is do the complete flip. He was the one of the- he was the COVID president. He was the recession president. The point at which I spend money on you is when you convince these people to come on your side. Why is this important? A, you move away from the ridiculous cultural issues that Republicans have made this about, which hurt minorities. Black lives matter is a hoax. Blue lives matter. Trans people are evil. You move away from that issue when you focus on the soup and potatoes issues that all people care about. How do I put food on the table? How do I get jobs? But secondly, and much more importantly, you move away from the narrative that this election was not won by Biden, because even if they believe that, as long as they have food on the table in a way that they didn't last year, they are much more likely to succeed. Panel, economically, all impacts in this debate on CO have to be contingent on our analysis. But secondly, even politically, we've shown to you, this is feasible to keep an absolute idiot out of office. For those reasons, I am very, very proud to oppose.\n"

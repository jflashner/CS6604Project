                "content": "We have never been prouder to stand against the extractive neo-colonialism that is perpetuated by the IMF, when they put arbitrary and destructive terms on countries that are in the midst of development that immensely need our help, that is a significant principle of being so proud to take it. So, instead of, why do we think that there are incentives to do policies that are done, sorry, why do we think there are good political incentives for countries to put policies in place when they are not imposed by the IMF? Firstly, we think that a lot of developing countries are to some extent democratic, and often their democracy, you know, democratic success is strongly predicated on economic success. So, even if you don't think they're democratically successful, a lot of authoritarian leaders stay in power because of economic success they can bring to their country. And thirdly, because we don't think that the most rogue states are likely to be getting loans from the IMF, we think they're often embargoed and sanctioned. What this means is that we think that even if the IMF doesn't impose loan conditions that may sometimes be favourable for these countries, the countries are likely to do it themselves, but the harm that we avoid is having incredibly bad loan conditions imposed on these countries. The point of all of this is that even if you believe that these countries are likely to suffer from elite capture, they will continue to benefit from the country doing well, and we're still very happy to stand for our anti-corruption. That's an incredibly important impact in this debate. Happy to take closing if they have a POI.\n\n> POI: If countries can implement good economic policy anyway, why do they oftentimes need an injection of capital?\n\nI think that there's a very large number of reasons that that's true. I think, like, extractive colonialism has often destabilised these countries, intervention by Western powers has often destabilised these countries, but also, like, everyone needs injections of capital. I think the fact that you've put economic terms on those things doesn't, like, reveal anything about the nature of these countries. Like, I've just spent a minute saying they're probably going to do policies that are good for their own economic incentives. The thing that happens on our side is that Western countries aren't able to bully them and pressure them and threaten them with starvation if they don't put in pro-Western policies. So, principally, why do we think these conditions are so wrong? We think it's, firstly, incredibly coercive.\n\n> POI: So, just to be clear, if we don't support our conditions, what types of conditions, if you have any conditions whatsoever, will you support on your side?\n\nSure. We're happy to support things like not saying you can't run a budget deficit or democracy, so people being able to choose the conditions they support. We think the thing is that countries are different, that they won't always benefit from the same sets of conditions. We think the best people to decide those are, like, the economists employed by governments in those countries and things like that. Firstly, we think it is highly coercive to opt into these loans. That is, these countries need the money desperately. They often have millions of people languishing without economic development. And so they're willing to make sacrifices that are principled and political in order to get them. Secondly, we think that the end point of this is that they lose a significant amount of autonomy by taking these loans. But secondly, we think that it is a principled wrong, in fact, for the IMF to offer or to coerce countries into these conditions. That is, firstly, because it is not done with the best interests of these countries at heart. I think there is a significant difference between economic white papers and things like that and saying you cannot have a loan unless you put a structural adjustment program in place. We're saying you cannot have a loan if you're willing to run budget deficits or have high minimum wages and things like that. But secondly, because there is a significant amount of historical evidence that these policies are bad and people continue to persist with them. That is, pro-market policies that have been forced upon countries like India by the IMF have been incredibly harmful in the past. We think that they perpetuate some of the worst bills in colonial justices of colonialism. But thirdly, we think that to the extent that you could perhaps buy it, that, you know, it is a good thing to offer a loan and, you know, there should be some kind of reciprocal give and take. We think that this is not justified. Firstly, we think that there is a huge amount of suffering within these countries and so there is probably, well, there is a moral obligation to offer, you know, to give them ways to get out of this, to help them, without imposing extractive conditions. No, thank you. Secondly, we think that this harm is often caused by people who back the IMF or was historically caused by them. And so we think that there probably isn't an obligation to accept, you know, damaging terms when you probably were put in the very position by countries like England or by countries like the US. But the third thing is that we think that the harm that it causes these countries is disproportionate and incredibly wrong compared to the, you know, benefit that it might be reasonable for people like the IMF or IMF backers to receive. We think, again, there could be other mutually beneficial policies and those are things we're happy to support. But we think that the best people to make decisions about a country's economic future are the people who vote for it and that's something we're incredibly proud to stand upon. But the second thing is, in the speech, that the terms are likely to be incredibly harmful, no thank you, and damaging to the fate of the development of these countries and to the citizens within them. Firstly, why do we think these terms are going to be very bad? By way of example, I point to the impact of structural adjustment programs in India. The fact that pushing free market rules on a country that was in a nascent stage of development has caused huge harms, arguably India has like missed the bus of regional development to a significant extent. I think that is a very clear problem. But, some structural reasons for this. Firstly, because these policies often push a very pro-Western model of development, which I would note a lot of Western countries didn't even follow, when, no thank you, follow while they were developing. That is, they, like you know, they oppose things like protectionism, financing industries or fuel subsidies, which the West was very willing to do while they were developing. But secondly, because trade is a zero-sum game and often these countries have an active, the countries that back the IMF have an active incentive to do things that are incredibly harmful. What does this look like? Making things that are highly advantageous for incredibly wealthy countries, who are able to buy cheap exports from these countries while they are in the midst of their development. Yeah.\n\n> POI: What are your structural reasons as to why a nation in Eastern Europe, Southern America, Southeast Asia knows what is best for its economic development?\n\nFirstly, I think that there are universities in these countries. Secondly, I think that they have the capacity to employ a large number of economists. Thirdly, I think that there's incentives for people within bodies like the UN or even the IMF to provide economic advice and countries are able to take it. But I think that this economic advice should be economic coercion and I think that it's incredibly important, thanks guys, I think it's incredibly important that we allow people to make decisions. Because I think that even if it is, you know, by some free market version of economics, better to have really low minimum wages. When people are voting on the fact that they no longer can afford to eat because they have such low wages that are so incredibly good for, you know, people making investments in their country, that is really harmful. Because trade is such a zero-sum game and there are so many benefits to being extractive, I think these policies are often, you know, able to take, to capitalise on the coercion that is inherent in the fact that some countries are incredibly wealthy and other countries have been consistently marginalised and extensively harmed by the system of capitalism that currently exists. So I think this is an incredibly important impact in this debate. Because I think, panel, that as Eleanor's going to explain to you, we're very likely to still get loans, I think they are politically popular within countries to do foreign aid, I think there's a lot of value to it. We can still get mutually beneficial things if people, for example, vote for a free trade deal, but on side opening government, we don't stand for any incredibly harmful, malicious imposition of these terms. So incredibly proud to oppose.\n"

                "content": "Panel, I know the stereotype about us that we will run a crazy pro-capitalist case in front of you that leads to money growth and big business. But we're going to be reasonable in front of you. And what we're going to tell you is that these conditions are the necessary balance to stop excessive overspending in this particular case, so that we, even though we may have some kind of sacrifices in the short term, for other future crises that hit, we're able to pay off these particular things and not plunge these economies into particular crises. First point of reading. Why are these likely to be good conditions that may grow? Firstly, I assume that this is a step-by-step process that will most likely happen. So you won't impose 100% of these conditions from today in this particular case, but most likely certain percentages up to certain days in this particular case. Secondly, I also think IMF wants to do this in a constructive and adequate way by giving consultancy, information, and sharing adequate pieces of this sort of case. Why is this a likely characterization? Number one, you don't want to be seen as bullies, because this is directly influenced in media by the countries who fund this particular fund in the West, who will portray a narrative that they are bankrupt in these countries, they are strong-arming them, and all because of all the rhetoric that you hear from this Australian team right here. These people are, how do you say, very liberal, they're middle class, they care about these particular issues, they don't necessarily pressure their government. Now because their government just got, how do you say, scandal on their hands, they're less likely to do this. But second, there are just strategic reasons for you to do this. Like number one, you most likely don't want to create huge shock into this particular economy by just imposing these conditions from tomorrow. But second, you also want these countries to cooperate with you, because you have some kind of legitimacy in front of this organization, like each year you have to show your KPI, this is how we've been working with these countries, this is why this is good in order to continue doing this particular case. Now, why absent these policies, do countries in these regions have structural incentives to overspend? Two reasons. Firstly, they want to win elections. What are the things that they're likely to do? Number one, they're likely to fund state-owned workers that exist in administrations, government companies in this particular case. Because these are people whose employment is directly connected with the ruling party right now, it's the surest way for you to guarantee democratic elections, and today they vote to you when you know that the money in your hat is coming from the ruling party in this particular case. But secondly, they're likely to fund pointless processes, building a road to nowhere, building a port that there isn't a ship there, or let's be nuanced here, not that extent of these things are that important, not that percent of ships are in this port in this particular case, or just funding companies that aren't necessarily important, like carpentry industry in this particular case, mining industry, you know, it's not such a shit, because this is the way that you buy out people who are ready to say, ah yes, the government, this particular thing, I will vote for this person. But thirdly, straight corruption in this particular case. And I know their side says that they keep corruption, but here is the comparative. IMF is impossible to control corruption 100%, and so far as they're expanding government spending, so they're expanding different streams of money going into the economy, it's far easier for you as corrupt oil to give money to people that are, let's say, close to you, people that will be loyal to you in this particular case. But secondly, voters in these regions aren't the most educated ones and aren't the most For the structural reasons this opening government gives you, all the processes that you have, colonialism, communists running your country for 50 years in this particular case, lack of money, all these things mean that you don't necessarily think critically in this particular case, but secondly, democracy in many of these countries has existed very, very rarely, so there aren't accountability checks, there aren't institutions. Why is this argument important? Because you are likely to vote for pro-left communist party that comes into this power, or the majority of political parties to be left-wing in this particular case, and to have a coalition between center-left and far-left, that necessarily, because they want to, how do you say, give promises back to their people, they do this, this is comparatively better on our side, because they can always say, oh no, I am in either hand, you can't do it, guys. This is the problem in this particular case. I will necessarily explain to you why this leads to more growth, that will mean that these countries are better able to pay off their loans in the future, and stop creating these problems. But before that, CG, you have this.\n\n> POI: Yes, the economy is a bait in the most important voting issue. If it gets worse on your side, why wouldn't people vote the people in power out?\n\nBut look, you vote the people in power out, but then the damage is already done, firstly. But secondly, because I proved to you, structurally, these people aren't the most educated, they are likely to be bloated by future policies, and secondly, you forget that the future, that the crisis happened, right? In 10 years' time, when there is a future crisis, you forget this particular case, because new political actors come into power, you vote for communists again in this particular case. Why is this necessary for more growth? Now, let's engage with all the things that are on your side, because Pavel did a very bad job. Firstly, interest rates. If interest rates are low, you're better able to get cheap loans that are directly used in the economy. This means that, for example, businesses can take out loans in order to start this particular business. Or consumers can take out loans, and they can buy more stuff, because the price on the loan is lower. This means that you're better able to increase, how do you say, the total money circulation in the economy. But secondly, if you're an export-based economy, and structurally, most of these countries are export-based, because they have cheap labor, because they don't have tertiary sectors, because the people aren't that educated in this particular case, and there are strong labor regulations. The currency is lower, because of the interest rates, because the loans are cheap, and there is multiple circulating currency in the economy. They're better able to export more, because the ratio of Western currency to this currency is decreased. But secondly, straight-up currency change. Many of these countries may do things like, for example, how do you say, deposit policies, where they mandate currency to exist in their economy. Or secondly, to, how do you say, increase the ratio of their currency to the other side's currency, which necessarily means that you have less capacity as a business to come in and set up. Less capacity as a business to operate in this particular case, because you're doing this sort of thing. And thirdly, on the fertilizers thing. Look, I'm not sure if this is fertilizers or fuels. I view this as general monopoly argument, right? So, country X has incentive to invest in certain sectors where they have, like, close people with political ties to them. Or, how do you say, they create their own voters, because these are corporate votes later. I think it depends on less than just fertilizers in this particular case. But when you create artificial monopolies by spending money in these sort of things, when these companies are already mandated, they're receiving money from the government, either direct cash on hand or these particular subsidies, they're able to create artificial market situation. There isn't any competition. When Gazprom is the only competition in this particular case, US other energy companies have no way to deal with them, because they can price you out in these types of cases. Because they've gotten the most educated workers within these particular cases. All these reasons, and all these processes mean that growth increases, jobs are increased, people grow money over time in this particular case. And note, we don't have to be scandalous. When inflation crisis hits, we'll increase interest rates to combat. Because everyone else around the world is also doing this. West, Eastern Europe, it doesn't matter. Everyone is doing this in person, so this is likely to be done sensible, right, in this particular case. This means that you have less spending done by the government and more capacity for the government to pay out. So you get added benefit, a job being created, but government is also better able to, uh, to try to signal spend this money. This is important, because governments are likely to work with the IMF on both sides of the house, because they like their laws. But when they're not able to pay, that's when they cut healthcare, that's when they cut other things that are important in this particular case, uh, like I already said, uh, expanding the, like, expanding healthcare, expanding education, expanding all these types of things, that's when government goes into crisis. For all these reasons, please oppose this motion.\n"

                "content": "That entire speech was essentially just trying to tell you that it's a harm to spend government money. I'm just going to point quickly to an example, which is the Asian Tigers, which developed incredibly effectively, without large-scale, uh, IMF loans, with heavy conditions on them, and with very large government spending. Not because there are actually big benefits of government spending, when they tell you, oh, but there's going to be infrastructure projects, oh my gosh, how terrible, they might build a road that could allow people to access a hospital or a school, they might build a road that would employ people and that would give them the money that they need during a time of serious economic strain to actually buy the things they needed to live. I'm sorry, but I'm failing to see why this is such a harm in this debate, and it simply buys in to all sorts of Western narratives that have been pushed onto developing countries that say that this is the only way you can develop, you can only develop if you follow this model. Note, that was not something that had worked. We would point to the comparison between China and India, and which one had been more effective at reducing poverty rates within their country and developing economically. There's two reasons why we're in this debate. Firstly, on the principle which gets entirely neglected in that speech and develops you a bit. Secondly, because you're the only side that gets you better development. Firstly on the principle, I think that I'm just going to point out that we give you really good analysis on this. Note the historical nature of the harm that had been done by the IMF specifically to a lot of developing countries. That was they had been significantly harmed by the structural adjustment programs that had been put onto them into the past. At the point at which you are reapplying those same sorts of conditions, you are continuing to compound a historical wrong that began at the point at which we had extractivism through colonialism. It's the point at which you deny them the autonomy because they simply cannot opt in to this process through proper consent at the point at which they rely on that money. They did not have the capacity to say no to this. You take away any sort of autonomy. Note that even if they tell you that this is going to be a terrible decision that's going to be made, we think that there is a principled reason why, that we get proven to you, why it is actually a good thing that they get to make this decision in the first place. And it is not pushed on them by a Western power that does not have, one, their best interests at heart, but even if they do, compound the historical wrong that we tell you was so important in this debate and that we had to allow them that autonomy back in what way that we possibly could when it was so difficult and so often taken away from them. Weigh this principle quite highly. It's something that's important in this debate given that historical nature. It is something that we take a win on uncontingent now. All right. Secondly then, we win this debate because we are the best in the development. I know there's a pre-emptive response in case CO comes out with something about why there's not going to be as much loaning of money. It would take away conditions. A couple of reasons for this. Firstly, because the IMF literally exists in order to provide loans. But secondly, even if you didn't believe that, that there were actual benefits to having these countries having enough money to function. That was because lots of Western countries wanted to trade with them, wanted to benefit from the sorts of materials that were coming out of these countries, the manufacturing they did. That was much harder to benefit from at the point at which people do not have the money governments do not have the money to function. But then thirdly, we thought that there was international reasons why different countries wanted to be perceived as good actors. Things like China and the US both wanting to be seen as helping in order to have the most international influence. But there were also just states that were generally considered to be good actors that gave away much more money than others. Some of the Scandinavian states come to mind. All right. At that point, it's pretty clear that there's still going to be money given on our side. The issue here now is whether or not it's used in better ways with or without structural reasons. So let's note here that the first thing they tell you is that, oh, obviously they're not going to make good decisions if we don't impose on them a way to make decisions. Firstly, that's contingent on them proving these restrictions are going to be good. I'm going to deal with that later. But secondly, I think that the reason why they're still likely to have good decisions being made, aside from their stuff about, oh, there's not enough people to make them, obviously there is a symmetric incentive from the IMF on both sides to do things like provide advice, to provide people that they can consult with. Perhaps in fact there's more incentive to do things like provide economists on our side of the house, because you cannot simply say, do it like this. You actually have to say, here are the reasons why this might be good. Here are the reasons why you could, here is how you can put this into place. That applied because they wanted to obviously still get certain returns, they still had certain views. But now you have the choice whether or not you want to change this. Obviously, until you don't live, there are reasons why you want your country to do well economically. Even if you believe that you're an authoritarian regime, often you're premised on how well economically you did in order to have the consent that meant that people did not protest all the time to knock down your regime. But I'm going to grind a knee back here as well. But note that you are now more likely to have the IMF do things like check up on your progress. Because rather than just saying, here is the condition, meet it, and then dump you with it, there was more of an incentive to make sure there was some level of transparency. What's happening with this money? Where is it going? And you continue to have things that are going to help that country to use it to the best of their abilities. Next thing they tell you is that when we put these in place, you stop excessive overspending. And then you might want to put this money into like, who knows what bad things that people don't like. Firstly, all the things they tell you are harms, I'm pretty much willing to copper, would be because they're spending generally on the people. Let's consider where the money is likely to be pulled out of at the point at which you cut spending. Because it wasn't going to be pulled out of mining. It wasn't going to be pulled out of things that were politically palatable that had masses of lobbying power behind them. It was going to be pulled out of things like welfare, like education, like rural stimulus programs, that there was no political incentive to fund at the point at which you do not have the excess money to do so. Note then, that all sorts of harms they're going to tell you about, excess overspending, probably apply the most on their side. Because they're now under pressure to keep those companies, to keep those corporate interests on side, when they do not have the same level of control, when they do not have the same level of money to spend on things. That would be the point at which you are more likely to exacerbate that harm, because you funnel the money into people who need it the most, need it the least, and you take it away from people who need it most. Closing.\n\n> POI: If you believe in the principled right to borrow however much money you want, why do you have some constraints, like anti-corruption?\n\nWe don't think the principled right to borrow as much money as you want. We believe that these countries have been fucked over by colonialism. No, anti-corruption is separatist. That was because it meant that the money went to the people in the country. We cared principally about the people within the country, more so than we cared about the government. That was to ensure that that money got there, which is why it's to an outside of the principled. But then lastly, they tell you that this is going to be really good conditions, because they're going to be put in place, firstly, step by step. None of that exacerbates the principled harm. At the point at which you opt into a loan, not knowing what the conditions are going to be in the long run, because you had no choice, that is when you lose the last remnants of your autonomy. Secondly, that also just doesn't show it's going to be good. We tell you that there are economic incentives for places like the IMF to impose loans that are favourable to the West. But secondly, also, knowing that they often need institutions simply did not understand what was going to be best for these countries, because they did not have the same experience of knowing what the conditions were like. It often came from a lack of information, that came from arrogance looking out from the West in, and imposing things that were not applicable inside. They lastly tell you then, that there's going to be less investment, because you still have to come up with a bad policy. I'm sorry, but firstly, obviously there is still investment in all of the countries, especially at the point when China and the US are decoupling, they have to go into these other countries, that increases it. But empirically, it's simply not true. We've seen heaps of investment in South Korea and Taiwan, which have not had the same regulations imposed by the IMF, because we've got to meet the best outcomes, and in principle and practice we're so proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "Firstly, on the nature of the laws I think we've provided structural reasons as to why it's very likely that these economies currently are export economies, and why this specifically factors into the nature of why the particular conditions are actually very beneficial for these particular economies, especially in the long term, when you gain the ability to diversify these economies, but also make sure that you have stable growth within the short term and middle term, while building out this particular new diversification. So why is this nature going to be fairly okay? I think there are two main responses here. Firstly, in specific cases that there's obviously like, because we have to talk about multiple economies, right? In specific cases where a particular condition is extremely bad, especially in the short term, you still have the ability and the incentives, which I'm going to prove, to make sure that this doesn't hit you that much. E.g., for example, when the European Union implemented embargo on Russian oil, it did not implement it right away for a particular country. It was over-dependent on it. For example, the Russian embargo for Bulgaria, Romania, and many of these countries was made as a condition after 2024, giving them enough time to basically recoup and make sure that they make different sources, so that the prices of this particular oil did not hit directly the consumers in these particular countries. So the question is, you obviously can do these things. Why do we have the incentive as the IMF to do these particular things? Obviously, in the long term, these countries are seen as long-term investments, as opening their markets and things like that. And obviously, the IMF is mostly like the money of Western countries who already have opened up and have market economies and would like their businesses to have access to the consumers in these places, but also make sure that these places produce good and effective stuff for them. Meaning that you have an incentive as an IMF in these countries to do it in the right way, to have a good idea, and to basically have a good image in front of these particular developing countries, and also make sure that you're out-competing China in the presence of this particular country. Meaning that you're likely to make this consensus when it matters the most. Not only in terms of timing, but when, for example, when 2020 hit, IMF restructured the loans for many of these particular countries. They can restructure the timing. Even in the worst-case scenario, they can remove the condition. But let's say they never remove the condition, I think they can definitely make it so the country can actually do it well. Why is this important to draw? It means that all of the short-term harms to these particular economies and countries that they can particularly claim are unlikely to happen. Meaning that all the long-term things that we talk in terms of stable growth and how this economy shifts into a better place are much more important. But second of all, in the short-term, when you know that these are long-term conditions, you as an investor that directly puts money into business and things like that, when you know that they're likely to have stronger currency in the future, when you learn that they're likely to have more good interest rates and things like that, you're far more likely to go into these countries in the first place and invest right now, right away. But also, because of all the structural reasons of overspending and human gaming, it means that you're basically prepared to handle future crises that come together, which is extremely important. Because look, you can kill people with welfare right now. But I'm not sure if you have the political capital for welfare in these countries, why you wouldn't do it on both sides of the house. It's good to spend. Governments have incentive to spend on both sides of the house. We agree with them. The problem is when they overspend and they're not prepared for the next four years. And even if a new government comes, they still have the same incentives that we have outlined. They're still going to overspend in order to capture the vote, make sure that they're the new big party, and things like that. This is an external factor, an overwatch eye that sends signals to investors that no matter what the government, these conditions will be met, and this overspending will not happen. Life is important. Because in the context of crisis, interest rates are going to... Basically, when you don't have the money, you're going to be late on payments in your current loans. Because every country takes loans. It means that basically your interest rate is going to increase even more. In certain cases, you can even damage your currency directly, like what happens with the bank freezes in Greece when they defaulted on their loans. Or even worse policies that you have to do, especially restrict spending even more in these conditions, because you know that you need to pay off those loans, or you're essentially defaulting on the current currency. This is when the vulnerable groups are going to be hit the most. This is when their lack of political capital is the most important in this particular round. Before I continue, closing.\n\n> POI: Your reasons about why this policy would be done good mitigate your benefit, because if you care so much to not anger those countries, you will not be as harsh, thus you cannot receive your benefits that much on your side of the house. Don't squirrel.\n\nNo, no, no, no, no. We can say that the IMF is not stupid, this is not squirrelling the debate. I give you ability and incentive in these particular cases. So, on that sense. I think also, in the very long term, by the growth in these economies, it empowers individuals on the whole. A lot of the policies and the conditions that we talked about are meaning that you have more FDI. It means more competition between international investors in your country, which means better working conditions, better options to work in general, better payment, better less ability for monopolization of markets, which on its own is extremely problematic. It means that a lot of these people, regardless of what is their class and social status, are likely to gain access to these things, and incentives in this case align greatly for our side of the house. I think, another form of way that I would like to say, in the future you have more bargaining power. If you have already opened up your economies and they are stronger, and they are seen as long-term growth economies, and you have different investors and partners in your country, you can choose, should I go to China, should I go to the IMF, but you can only have the bargaining power against China not fucking you over with bad laws and bad conditions if you are seen as a good developing economy in the first place. Finally, on the principle, I think you already know it's complete bullshit, but I think that you cannot uphold your principle right to help these people or let them choose if they are forced to live in conditions and actually protect them against their own government's incentive, which we do much better on our side of the house. And honestly, I don't care if we give them jobs, opportunities, and we make sure that these countries protect them for future things. Because when the economy hits, this is when they are going to lose their jobs, factories are going to be closed. I've never been fucking proud of to oppose.\n"

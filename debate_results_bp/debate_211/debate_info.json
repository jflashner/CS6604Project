                "content": "The highest rate of plastic surgery per population in the world, Gangnam Style, is world renowned for what it does. If at the point at which we have to choose whether we want to be an average human being or a celebrity who is complicit in thousands or millions of young girls trying to take diet pills, taking plastic surgery, etc., we would much rather choose the average life. There are going to be three points in this speech. First of all, I'm going to talk about the incentives of media and talent agencies, why that uniquely leads to three impacts: one in terms of your bargaining power and the fact that you lose agency. Secondly, I'm going to talk about mental and physical health, why that's bad, and thirdly, I'm going to talk about complicity before I go on to the comparative. Okay, let's be really clear. What are the incentives of media and talent agencies and what is the framing for this round? How do you get people in Korea? If you want to be a K-pop star, you have to go to agencies like Sully, which start recruiting children as young as seven. What are the incentives to recruit people who are extremely young? First of all, it allows them to construct a backstory, a narrative about you, such that you can sell yourself to the population and be marketable well into the future. Secondly, it also allows them to assess who is talented and who's not, especially considering the K-pop market is really, really saturated and they want the best sort of person. And lastly, it's also about profits making in the long run. If you have somebody for you working for you for 40 years, and you're going to get more profit as opposed to somebody who's working for you for 10 years. This is a process that this person has gone through and come through to get here. What is the problem over here? I want to know two specific problems over here. In all likelihood, on the balance of probability, you got into this really young when you were seven or twelve. First of all, at the point at which you entered this industry, in order for you to be successful, there was no informed choice, no informed consent. At the point at which you did this, your parents made this decision for you and control your life to get through over here. But secondly, I want to note also at the point at which you're already within the talent agency, the talent agency socializes you in terms of your expectations in the future life and what you want to do. So if you want to become a doctor, it becomes really, really difficult for you to get out because you've been socialized and locked into this. This is a huge problem, especially for the second reason over here, which is to say that you have no bargaining power in terms of your agency. So if they want to run stuff like \"we want discursive change,\" we want to, you know, impact the U.N., etc., there are two problems over why you have no control over your life and why it's made me must be weighed very heavily in the round. First of all, in order for you to be successful, here's the kind of shit that you must do: you must lose weight. South Korean beauty standards are extremely conservative. Shermay now wants to be 49 kilograms explicitly because of this sort of shit. Well, you must be extremely, extremely same so that you can attract a very huge chunk of the market. This means, again, weight loss pills, this means plastic surgery, so on and so forth. But also, it is conservative in terms of sexual identities. You cannot be openly gay. They are going to control who you get into a relationship with, who you're not getting in a relationship with, which brand you're endorsing, which brand you're not endorsing. Again, they want you to be straight because if you are straight, you sell well with the population and you're not controversial. The last thing to notice: you have no ability to assert your rights because, again, the market is saturated. Lots of people want to be K-pop stars, which means that you can be replaced at any single point in which they want to replace you, especially because they have like a literal fucking talent pool behind you, which means that there is a loss of agency on their side that necessarily happens. This is the biggest harm for a human being and so far even money is used a panel so that it can give you happiness. But if you have no control over your life, you're not a human being, you're a fucking robot for some talent agency. But secondly, I also want to talk about mental and physical health. First of all, mental health is extremely like, you know, big taboo topic within Korea. That's why lots of people, even celebrities, do not talk about depression, do not talk about lots of other things because they are perceived in the population as weak people, not Korean people who are strong or Asian people who do not have these sorts of values, which is also distinct from why they're distinct from celebrities in the West. I want to note that you cannot have access to mental health for this reason or talk about mental health issues. But secondly, there's intense media scrutiny that doesn't necessarily happen in your life, which is to say that it sells if you can say this, this pop star takes drugs, this has a drug abuse problem, or this pop star goes to this sort of therapy clinic. So you have no privacy over your life. This makes your mental life much worse and you aren't even able to access mental health care in the first place because you're afraid that you will be outed and your profession will, you know, go down. On the comparative, because we do not have this scrutiny on our side, we have much more ability to decide who we want to be with and basically also whether you want to access mental health care or not. So we have much more decision-making power when you be an anonymous Korean person on our side. Before moving on, I'll take CO.\n\n> POI: How many diet pills do you think sai has taken?\n\nI don't care about Sai because Sai is the only person who is, uh, the only person on your side of the house. Look at BTS. Look at the whole, fucking, like, if you're really going to say that only side did it, like, fair enough. If you want to go compete on side, go for it. Okay. In terms of mental and physical health, again, this means that you're likely to get plastic surgeries, weight, diet, etc. It exposes you to lots of mental health, uh, and physical health ramifications, especially if you're a kid, right? If you're a kid and you're taking diet pills, if you're a kid and you're exercising more than, I don't know, you're studying or whatever you're doing. I want you to note that this locks you in and it makes your health worse. Also, I want to say another reason why you can't shift professions is specifically because you must focus on this talent as opposed to your education, so you don't diversify your skill set and you're locked in to this sort of, to this sort of, uh, you know, industry. Lastly, on why it is, you know, you are morally complicit in the harms that are true to lots of people, I want to note that South Korea has one of the highest teen suicide rates in the world, and especially female teen suicide rates in the world. This is because the expectations that you create as a person within the industry. And you know, again, on average, you're going to be a very, extremely good looking person, uh, working out, so on and so forth, uh, really white also because there's also a dark white, uh, issue within South Korea. The problem over here is one, you are forcing lots of kids so that they can gain social acceptability to go on the same sorts of, like, toxic routine that you have gone through. So lots of kids have to do that, and in the process, they're also exposed to the mental health harms. But secondly, for people who have no consent or how they look, imagine a kid who is being bullied because they don't look like the person who's at in BTS. So many kids are bullied because of this sort of stuff. So regardless of whether you have fame or money, the fact that unconsenting individuals, mostly kids, are going to be harmed by your actions means that that money does not matter for shit. You're complicit in lots of abuses for these people. They don't live enjoyable lives because of you. The harm principle applies, okay? Lastly, comparative, why are we better off? First, one, I want to note the average person in South Korea actually lives like a very decent life. That's because the South Korea Korean economy is one of the largest economies within Asia. It also has like a booming tech sector, so on and so forth. So, and also has one of the largest main income rates within Asia. So you probably have lots of money, so you get to do that. But secondly, on our side of the house, if you really want to do like music, guys, you can always go to the pub to sing karaoke with your, with your mates or whatever. On their side of the house, it's not even that you are producing the music that you like. You'll be producing the music that the talent agency forces you to produce. So if it is about artistic freedom, you don't get that on their side. But lastly, I want to say that in terms of, you know, long-term finances, we are better off because in South Korea, there's a huge problem with people who get old. Old people are not seen as desirable anymore, and they are thrown out again because of the saturation and the fact that you were replaced. So in the long run, they don't get lots of money and they don't get lots of fame, again, panel for women who are already screwed by the patriarchy, but further screwed because of K-pop. For protecting the mental health of this individual, the physical health of this individual, and to not cause harm to other people, very proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "PM says things like beauty norms and mental health are bad in South Korea. Speaks to how little of their case is actually inherent to the motion. A lot of the same problems are still going to exist for the average South Korean, but being a K-pop star gives you more money, more identity, and more subversive power to escape the mundanities of life. I'm going to be talking about three things in this speech. Firstly, about why a higher raw salary is the easiest thing to weigh in this debate. Secondly, about broader purpose in your life. And then finally, about day-to-day enjoyment on money. I want to start by responding to the claim they can just be replaced at any point. Number one, the motion says a K-pop star. This is not about people who are trying to break into the industry, but we have fiat power to say that you are probably going to be quite successful and therefore having like a unique skill set that allows you to be the next side or the next famous person. Secondly, if their characterization is true that industries are literally recruiting you at age seven, it is probably the case that they put quite a lot of work into that you become tied to the brand and therefore it's going to look quite bad for them reputationally they just decide to let you go. Let's talk about capital. What does the average salary look like in South Korea? That's going to clash with the characterization that we hear at the end of PM. Number one, there tends to be relatively high degrees of income inequality due to the domination of table industries or people at the top make a lot of money but these are often tied to state kind of patronage networks. Unless you are running these companies, if you're a worker, you don't really have an incentive to treat you super well so the average person is not paid a super high salary. Secondly, economic prospects are quite bleak into the future for the average person. There's an aging population. It is true that they have a tech sector but it's also true that you're competing with China, which has massive state-owned investment into these industries and like Taiwan that also produces things like semiconductors to a large extent. Thirdly, there are problematic kinds of gender norms when it comes to the economy, in particular where women tend to be locked at a higher level of corporate position because the brand of Catholicism that was perpetuated by colonial powers just marginalized women to a large extent. Therefore, they are locked out of these positions on balance and earn lower salaries. On the comparative, if you're a K-pop star, you are literally earning millions of dollars from things like raw things that you're paid by your industry when you go touring, from things like sponsorships, even from things like advertising on your Instagram. You can kind of become an influencer in a way. You just get really, really rich. So, I know that like the money argument is not super popular in debate. I think it's super, super important for three reasons. The first thing to say is that even if you do not care about yourself, you have other obligations in your life you tend to value quite highly. You probably care about your partner. You probably care about supporting your elderly parents. You might have kids one day and you want to support them. I think that it brings you a lot of joy when you can see yourself fulfilling obligations that you believe are proximate to you, making other people in your immediate surroundings you love dearly a lot more happy. Secondly, money unlocks choice into the future with your career. If you really hate being a K-pop star, you're able to retire and leave. PM says you can't leave because they take you when you're really young. Two things to say. Number one, like you literally can. Like if you're 20 and you're not enjoying the industry, you can just leave. They tried you on this by saying like, but you are now coerced into being a K-pop star. Like I think that even if you're involved in an industry for a long time, you still know what your preferences are and this is really important, panel. If you're coerced to be a K-pop star because they convince you that you really, really like it, if you really, really like it, I'm unclear why it matters if you were coerced in the first place because the actual level of utility that you're experiencing is still quite high at the end of the day. The third thing to say is that money just unlocks a variety of hedonistic pleasures that are very, very important. You can go and eat at night restaurants, you can go and travel to museums that you really love in the world. You know, the best way to get mental health help is having a crap ton of money. You're better able to do all these things under our state of the house and actually experiencing daily kinds of joys. And I want to note that the classic response is like, but you get used to it. Like you don't. Hedonistic pleasures like eating amazing food are things that bring you a daily burst of joy when you actually experience them. I want to give you a very important weighing mechanism of this argument into this debate. We cannot be sure what your preferences are as the average individual. We cannot say whether you like fame. We cannot say whether you like privacy. Therefore, the most rational weighing metric in this round is allowing the individual to choose what their preferences are for themselves. And therefore, the best way to do that is to maximize the capital that we have because we're not being a K-pop star 24 hours a day. We have other things in our lives and therefore we can better allocate capital in that regard. Secondly, let's talk about broader purpose in life and how we think about ourselves. I want to just briefly rebut their claim about like you can't get an education. Like you can often do it on the side, right? Like even if you're getting into this when you're younger, or you can just go back to school. I would posit that what the human psyche really wants is for us to feel like we matter in the world and like we mean something to other people. I think that there's a few things inherent to being a K-pop star in particular that give us a level of purpose that cannot be accessed by things like family, friends, or the economy. The first thing to say is that you feel like you're making other individuals happy on a daily basis. When I'm performing at a concert, I see kids who are beaming at me. I make a kid's day when I write my autograph on their head or like on their head or on like whatever paper note that they're holding. I see people holding posters that are cheering for me in the crowd. I think that most moral systems emphasize notions of kindness and selflessness and therefore we are indoctrinated to believe that bringing happiness to other people ends up being a moral good. Therefore, we end up perceiving ourselves as being a better person and it just makes it easier for us to live with ourselves and we feel like we're doing a good thing by making other people happy and get a warm fuzzy feeling inside. The second thing to say is that you feel like you're leaving a huge legacy which is really, really important. But when I die, I'm not actually going to die because everyone is going to remember my name and you feel less like just a small specter of dust in the universe. I think that legacy matters for a few reasons. Firstly, I think it helps you get through hard times when you feel like your life has a broader purpose at the end of the day. Secondly, I think it helps buffer against forms of nihilism as well where you feel less like you're just cogs in a capitalist machine, like an irrelevant speck of dust, but rather like our life assumes a broader degree of significance because we're going to matter after our death. But finally, this kind of identity is unique because it allows us to ground purpose in a way that's unique to others. Everyone might try and find purpose in their jobs, but you are finding purpose in something that only 2% or 1% of the population can access, which is being a K-pop star. I think that there tends to be social veneration of notions of uniqueness because it makes us feel like an independent person and we are often told by like our parents just like be unique, be special, be cool when we were younger and therefore you feel like you are distinctly a good person relative to others. Before I continue, OG.\n\n> POI: Most people who are abused are conditioned to like the abuse. Are you for that because that seems to be the ...\n\nNo, okay, I'm just going to give a bunch of reasons why abuse is not going to happen. I don't think you are conditioned to like abuse. I think you would leave if you were being abused because it hurts. It's emotionally traumatizing for you. Let's talk about day-to-day experiences and fun. What does life look like due to capitalism? People are not choosing what they are doing under their side of the house. You often just have to go into what your parents want you to, or you have to go into whatever the dominant industries of South Korea are, which are often manufacturing and tech. Not everyone's preferences are aligned with them. They ever end up locking people into something that is not actually what their preference is. Even if you think that these industries are abusive, that is uncomparative because you lack choice over industries under their side of the house when it's dictated by the whims of the economy. The act of K-pop is fun for a few reasons. First, there tends to be a large degree of camaraderie between other people within your group, like BTS and Black Thing, being quite close. This is different from other kinds of friendship because you have a lot of shared experiences while you're on tour together, and finding so much time with one another allows you to know one another a lot more intimately. Secondly, you get to travel and see the world. I think a lot of people find this very fun because it's just boring to see surroundings all the time. I think that it unlocks joys when you understand things a lot better. They say, \"But these industries are bad.\" What about beauty norms? Number one, this is uncomparative. Like beauty norms, as PM concedes, things like cosmetic surgery are prevalent in South Korea overall. Secondly, though, once you become really famous, we're better able to subvert these things because you know that you're always going to have some level of fan base, even if you do something like gain a little bit of weight or wear clothes that are more subversive. Therefore, when you already have a cult of personality, you have way more subversive power than the average person, which is why K-pop stars often do things like set new fashion trends. That ultimately exists for all these reasons. I'm very proud to stand in opening opposition.\n"

                "debater_name": "OG",
                "content": "Kim Jong-hyun, the lead member of the band SHINee, committed suicide at the age of 27 last year after repeatedly talking about mental health problems and getting flak for it on Twitter. Five members of the male K-pop band Big Bang were implicated in a sexual abuse scandal where they were incurring sexual favors of women in order to hang out with them. Soon-lee, the lead member of the band f(x), committed suicide after repeatedly talking about mental health problems and getting flak for it on Twitter. Five members of the male K-pop band Big Bang of the band f(x) killed herself last year for similar reasons to do with mental health, and finally, Goo Hara, lead member of band Kara, also killed herself for body expectation pressures raised on her in the industry. These are unfortunate examples to mention, panel, but these are problems which are germane to the K-pop industry, and I'm going to show to you why. The first thing that this says is that salary is important. I would posit that salary is important insofar as it's instrumental towards your happiness. If I'm in bonded labor and I'm making a million a year, I don't necessarily care because I don't have the time to enjoy that money. I have high expectations placed on me, and I am fundamentally not free. Number two, there's a past dependency problem that they miss where the point at which you do exit the industry, you can't go anywhere else because you joined at the age of seven. You don't have the education and the skills necessary to go into another industry. Their only response to this was you can simply quit. I mean you can, but like you'll be messed up otherwise. It's like sports people, right? Unfortunately, past 35 if they've made enough money, they're fine, otherwise they're not, but see they assume that BTS is getting the money in the first place. These contracts are very exploitative for the reasons that Taha gave, like companies coerce you into contracts where BTS literally touring last year before the pandemic was living in a hostel while their company was making millions of dollars. This is the problem when you get eight-year-olds under the pretense of parents who just want their kids to be famous signing contracts. You don't make informed choices, which is even in their best world they get very low salaries for these people, but finally they said salaries are instrumental towards relationships. What relationships when you are on tour 24-7, when the media is on your case in terms of who your boyfriend is, who your girlfriend is, the person that you love, God forbid if they're gay because then you're not going to get another signing contract, but secondarily your family is never going to have enough time for you because they will consistently make it about your elderly mother having schizophrenia or whatever it may be, which means that even if the salary is instrumental towards getting better outcomes for your family, your family is significantly compromised in their world. The second claim then was that the point at which you have money, you can make choices which can change the narratives of the industry. The first thing I want to point out here, which I think is really important, is that you are conditioned into the cycle of abuse. They completely ignore this point of information. If you've been from the age of eight and nine used to a regime where people abuse you through systematic practice regimes, you will practice for 18 hours a day or else you will practice for 16 hours a day or we won't give you the money, but secondly in the worst case also pay sexual and physical abuse, then not only do you normalize it for yourself, you normalize it for others, you don't recognize it within the industry because that's been the fundamentally normal trade-off that you've been making in your entire life. This was the unfortunate story of Hollywood for a long time, but number two, who becomes a K-pop star in the first place, right? The sort of person who gets selected in the audition studio after 300 people showing up is probably the person who has a bit more connections with their parents than other people do. What this means then is that even as an anonymous person, you are likely to have a significantly middle-class upper-middle-class life where you can make a reasonable amount of money on our side. The final thing then is in terms of legacy. One, why is a legacy important? Lots of people live lives where they don't feel an intention to leave behind a legacy. This is like intuition bias and debating, right? We're all full of ourselves and arrogant so we want to leave behind legacies. The vast majority of the planet does not give a care. They live a good life and they move on with their lives, so they believe in God statistically like two-thirds of the planet so they're going to be fine in the afterlife. But three and most importantly, why is your legacy not \"I left behind a child who I cared for, I got a promotion in my local job\"? Like normal people have normal legacies, and two, if you've not become a K-pop star, then you don't have the expectations of a K-pop star, so there's a temporal gap in their problem, so you just have the legacies of a normal person who enjoys the anonymity on our side. What is standing still from our side which has not been rebutted? Hey, you are actively complicit in the harms given to other young teenage girls the point at which you enter their industry. The only response to this was peripheral, which is that even if you're an average anonymous Korean person, you might follow this person. Yes, but there's a difference between me taking a loan from JP Morgan and working for JP Morgan. In one side, I'm actively complicit in the abuses scored to people such as myself and other people, but secondly and much more importantly, this argument stands upstream of all of the arguments on salary, upstream of all of the arguments about you having a better life. If you're complicit in the suffering of millions of other people who also did not make informed choices, then we are significantly likely to win the debate. The next thing I want to do is focus on our outcomes or physical and mental health before I do that. I'm going to take engagement from CO. Go ahead.\n\n> POI: There is increasing commercial pressure to deal with the kind of scandals that you're talking about because people care very deeply about these stars. Why were corporations buying into that pressure?\n\nUm, systemic reasons that Kaha gave for how Korea has a conservative domestic culture. So, I don't know why they would land on your side of the debate and not our side. But secondly, speaking, how did it deal with Britney Spears? How did it deal with Lindsay Lohan? It wasn't like, \"Guys, there's a problem, we should talk about this in the open and have public discourse.\" Let's shut her up in a hospital room and give guardianship to people. This is the exact same thing that's going to happen in K-pop. Where the more fans are concerned about BTS, the more they will be muzzled, the more they will be censored, the more they will be systematically locked out of giving press conferences. So, if anything, the more the abuses scale, the more the newspapers talk about it, companies have greater and greater incentives to coerce you into silence and to coerce you into acceptance. Note: your albums do not sell if you come out and say, \"I have a tragic, depressing life and no one cares about me.\" But secondly, also importantly, you don't choose the creative direction of your music. This was analysis completely missed by Leader of Opposition. You choose the music with charts. Well, you choose the music which the marketing analysts say will win, like the four chords that I use in every song at this point in our world. At least, even if you're an anonymous Korean citizen, you can once a year play in the karaoke. I'm part of a very amateur band because I dream to be a musician, and I'm happy for that to give me musical and artistic satisfaction. But it doesn't come with the downside of celebrity, the coercion of fame, all of that bad stuff, which means that we can still engage musically in our world without necessarily being compromised. Finally, then, why do we win as an anonymous citizen? The first thing I want to point out here, which I think is important, is that you can live a middle-class life because that's what South Korea is like. Know that it was a very surface-level response here, which is that, you know, gender norms, expectations exist outwards elsewhere in South Korea. That's like saying that gender norms exist in academia and modeling. They're obviously worse in modeling. Like, I just don't know how to rebut that, Name. Right? Because I am willing to lose this debate on the intuition that the average bank and the average school and the average hospital has much less gender norm expectations than the K-pop industry does. But secondly, speaking, you save up money. You save up money because you're not contingent on a career that ends at age 34 because you're not good looking enough, you're not young enough, all of that stuff. But thirdly and finally, panel, I challenge this intuition that everyone is a hedonist trying to satisfy themselves. Again, get outside of the debate bubble, right? Some people are happy. Most people across the planet, statistically, are happy having a bit of money on the side, going for one holiday a year to France, and that's good enough for them. I... It's unclear to me by having everything like in the Sharpie Evans High School Musical style is the only life that you're willing to get behind, as opposed to having a house, having a family, and being happy. Panel, this is an extraordinarily exploitative regime of child abuse on their side. You can't stand behind this. Live the anonymous life. That's what we stand behind. I'm very, very proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "Each was a \"dynamite\", \"mic drop,\" whereas \"On\" prop, \"Life Goes On,\" those are the only K-pop songs I know. Firstly, I'm going to chat about the principle. Secondly, I'm going to discuss the industry and how it can get better. Finally, on the individual on complicity, there are three things I want to say here. The first thing to say is that the more they say that you are conditioned, that you have no agency when you're acting in this particular way, the less you can say they are complicit for anything. For example, if I was told my entire life that I should do X thing, if everyone around me pushed me to do X thing, if there are dangerous outcomes if I don't do X thing, my responsibility morally for doing X thing is very, very, very, very low. In the same way that if I have a gun to my head and I do something, it is not really my responsibility. So the more they push claims that you are pushed into this particular way of life, the less you are complicit. Secondly, should we really be held responsible for being a very, very, very, very small part of a particular problem? K-pop is still going to exist on their side of the house. All of these problems are still going to persist. I'm going to go for a long drive to McGill with my mother after this tournament is over, and that is going to be damaging for the environment very much. But I wouldn't really say that I am morally responsible and shouldn't go in that way of life because it's such a benefit to me and such a very, very low harm compared to such a massive harm of climate change. Overall, it seems very, very strange to say that complicity is a really big moral metric here. Thirdly, you could change the industry from within yourself, i.e., you could speak out against those norms. Now let's explain how that works because Humza gives the response that you're, you know, going to face tons of backlash from this. First of all, you have tons of leverage, and I know Naomi gave this response, and Humza rebuilds it by saying, \"Well, there isn't really tons of other industries that you can go into, and you might not have tons of money.\" First, you are already a star, you already do have tons of money. Secondly, your stardom is not tied to being in a particular company, it is tied to being in the public sphere. You are still going to be able to get endorsements after, you will still be able to go to other companies. This is particularly true in the context of K-pop, where American and North American and European competition is now seeping in slowly as it has become a predominant business model within the West as well. Look at how BTS's new song \"Dynamite\" was written and produced by Americans because this is something that is seen as a good business model. This is also a reason for why the industry is likely to liberalize because if there are other options and corporations that you can go to as a K-pop star, this leads to a positive pressure to make conditions as good as possible for everyone in this field. This is also a reason for why you are able to write many of your own songs because this is literally trends that are often set by K-pop and by K-pop stars themselves, right? Like K-pop in the West was not something that really existed until four or five years ago, but trends changed and people enjoy different sorts of music in the same way that trends in music change all the time. So it's not the case that you're just locked into this fundamentally like caging sense, a sense of music under the other side of the house. But finally, contracts are getting way, way better. Now, their characterization is you get signed when you're seven. This seems very, very bizarre to me, and the reason for that is quite simple. It is because you don't know if someone is going to be good when they are seven. So you're spending tons and tons of money into like tons of seven-year-olds. Like you're paying them loads, you're signing huge contracts with their parents, parents who are giving up their own middle-class lifestyle for this in many instances. So it just seems bizarre that they would actually be signing people at seven years old. It's much more plausible that you wait until someone's like 18, 19, someone's very skilled. But at that point, someone has probably other options that they could sign with. There's a positive, you know, positive incentive type good competition. This is why like musicians are paid a lot of money when they are stars. It's not the case that you just get signed exploited contracts. But finally, contracts renew over time. Like you can't sign to a lifetime contract. You have to renew it. So you know, when you get a lot more money, you can, you know, do it later. This is important because you have the agency to even if you don't believe you have the agency to do many things, to do some things. For example, you can have access to therapy if you would like. Now, they might say, \"Ah, but you know, there's going to be so much scrutiny that you won't be able to.\" Like, you can go to online therapy. You can go to therapy in the secret. Like, if your therapist reveals that you're going to them, like, they can literally get sent to prison because of like client privilege. Like, we just suggest that you are able to access those sorts of mental health things on the other side of the house. The industry is getting better, especially when you are going to be in it. Finally, like, there are just other modes of being a K-pop idol that can exist. Like, the example of Psy obviously is trivial, but it does suggest and point to the fact that it is not a necessary and fundamental requirement to look a certain way. There are obviously pressures that push you in a certain direction, but you're able to, if you're really, really skilled at music and are a star that already has a cult of personality, you are able to do certain things in that instance, right? So you're able to diversify your own portfolio of interest, I guess is what I'm saying. Finally, why was money indeed important? I want to point out, K-pop in South Korea is not just like a normal industry. It's not like you live a normal life. It's not like you have normal prestige. K-pop is one of the most prestigious organizations in that entire country. It is very, very much different from living a normal middle-class lifestyle because you are valorized as a person. The very fact that they think that you're going to be taken down a peg if you do something wrong shows how valorized you are in the first place. Because the only reason that you would be taken down a peg if you did something wrong would be if you were expected to be good in the first instance. What this suggests is it is a much deeper level of entitlement and power and prestige that was important for you as an individual. This is really important because scrutiny on an everyday level is not important if you feel fulfillment as a result of that scrutiny. There are three reasons why you're more likely to have positive comments that outweigh negative ones that you might get on prop side. Firstly, there's more often that you just get way more of them because you have that cult of personality that we already mentioned and OG mentions as well. There are so many fans that are really, really integrated with only within your own lifestyle, especially fans who are typically younger and less conservative than their forebears. They won't necessarily care as much if you come out as gay, for example. But also, you can diversify your interest to other countries, for example, going to North America for tours. So it's less likely that you rely on the South Korean demographic. Secondly, your social media managers and social media sites are likely to be filtered in ways which benefit you, i.e., your managers don't want to make you feel really shitty, so they're going to decrease the amount of negative comments that you get to see because they don't want you to quit or leave or go to therapy or whatever. I'll take CG before I move on.\n\n> POI: So for the past 5 000 years have koreans been taught that it's good to be extraordinary or ordinary?\n\nI think most people have been taught to be extraordinary, and the reason for that is very simple. Extraordinary people do things that benefit society. We are told that we ought to strive for greatness in school, be the best at our jobs, and strive for the most money. All of these things are taught in order to be unique and benefit the rest of society. We are cultured and indoctrinated to believe that. But the last reason why you're more likely to receive positive comments is that it's more likely to match up with what the people around you are saying. They say, \"Well, you can't have any friends like the ones you can have friends within the industry, you can have friends within your K-pop group like BTS, which has 10 members for what I know, but also you can just have other friends who you have deep connections with, maybe someone who you grew up with at school that you are still friends with that doesn't rely on fame for you to be friends.\" Trivially, I think that you can still have relationships under our side of the house, so they're likely to confirm the positive comments that you get and deny the negative ones, and those are typically people that you trust. Finally, industry norms are going to be problematic regardless. The average quality of life is not like the poorest in the world, but it's still obviously not as good as K-pop. Insofar as you are often still having the same gender norms put upon you, i.e., it is much more difficult if you unluck out and become a woman under their side of the house to access things like a job because your husband tells you to stay home and society tells you to stay home as well. It was less likely that industry norms were bad because industry norms wanted to relate to the people who were in that industry who had much power over it, and therefore it was more likely that they were malleable, whereas in general society, each individual person has very, very little control. The gender norms that they talk about, as well as the social perceptions of looking beautiful, still apply. The question was whether you were able to change those norms by wearing new clothes, by looking in a different way, where K-pop idols have significant power, whether you're just someone who had to follow. We're very proud to oppose.\n"

                "content": "It is crazy that when it is the bullet that takes the toll, we form courts, but when it is the bacteria, we throw up our hands and we forget like it never happened. To be clear, what are we doing in this debate? Firstly, we broadly expect an international court to be created in alignment with the World Health Organization, and we expect it to be heavily supported by all the countries part of the World Health Organization. We expect us to have the participation of scientists, experts to consistently write technical papers in order to inform our judgments, appointees from each country for judges, and so on. We also expect that participation in the World Health Organization and receiving benefits like aid is conditional to being party to this international court. Why is this likely to be the manifestation of a court? I know up will challenge this. There are seven reasons why we think countries will opt in and why we think this will be effective. First, countries that do not consent to such an authority without themselves having some say in the negotiation of that body would obviously be revolting, so they would like to have some participation given that this body will have some control over the world's health resources, no matter what. Secondly, the second is that this is likely to be a broad worry that the international community is ineffective, which is why they are likely to take these actions into their own hands because they want to make these decisions reasonable. They learn from some mistakes of previous international courts. Thirdly, the third is that people generally care about health as an issue and they want to be a participant to many things that are clearly on the level of a global scale. The fourth is that there is a selfish advantage to imposing stringent regulations in that leaders now are unlikely to face the consequences of being punished as they are on their way out, but will benefit from the legitimacy this provides other authoritarianism or whatever they are. Fifthly, is that there is not the game theoretic advantage in that you are harmed by other states in the case that a pandemic goes awry, so you want to hold other states to account. Sixthly, the advantage is that many benefits you care about like health, education, cheap medical goods, and so on will be contingent on this. And beyond that, there are spillover effects like economic benefits that you might care about, so you want to be party to this in order to receive the benefits of the World Health Organization and so on. So what the crimes are we punishing? So we look to examples like Bolsonaro being unwilling to comply with a recommendation for usage of masks and quarantine measures. We're looking at the unwillingness for China to comply with World Health Organization investigations on the Virology Institute, Wuhan. We're talking about the hoarding of resources in countries and so on vaccines and ventilators. Why do they do these crimes? So there are a variety of reasons we suspect they might do this. They might not be technologically at the time, or they might not have the right decision, or maybe it's just the short-term incentives were too powerful and they felt the need to sacrifice thousands of lives in the future to allay present fears. We will impose punishments such as imprisoning leaders for extended periods of time, taking them out of power, or asking them to be deposed. We're okay with doing this during the crisis if it is feasible to realign national incentives, but we expect that in some cases for it to happen after the fact anyway. So there are two arguments in the speech. First, what are the benefits? Before that, I'll take a POI from closing opposition.\n\n> POI: So we also tried creating an international court for human crimes and counts against humanity. How successful has that been?\n\nThat's a good question. Maybe you should answer on your speech number one. We believe that there are trivial benefits that encouraging countries to comply with health regulation. Note that this massively changes the incentives of leaders. We identify in the setup for all the reasons we give. We suspect this has gigantic benefits. First, on following the regulations on pandemics. Things like Covid, potential future ones like SARS, preventable diseases like malaria. First, we enjoin the prevention of future harm from occurring to people because measures are taken to overturn the anti-short-term. The short-term incentive to focus on keeping the economy afloat instead of the long-term incentive of acting early. We're able to mobilize health forces to start early lockdown in areas that would not have otherwise done it. Which means that we prevent massively the spread of diseases while they are still easy to solve. Secondly, this allows for effective health care response in that actual policies imposed by the World Health Organization are substantially more effective than once implemented on the ground because they have access to a greater breadth of resources such as health experts from all around the world who have access to various different contexts and so on. Thirdly, they benefit from a cohesive response in the sense that lockdowns and other policies become ineffective since pandemics don't recognize borders. Even if the spread is very slow in one place, if it is open in another place, the spread might still continue and as such, you will have to keep it locked down for as long as everyone has kept their borders open. We also suspect the allocation of effective resources to where it's most needed. It is crazy that in the Philippines, hospitals are missing ventilators, vaccines, and beds while there are storehouses full of them in the Western world. We suspect it will be a massive benefit simply to put places when resources in some countries into other countries and to allow access to these things at the threat of imprisoning people for hoarding resources. For future potential gain, notably this also deals with massive future benefits such as antibiotics. Where in the sense that in the order in the order of future potential lives, diseases that have no cure might potentially arise because we have. They have built up an immunity to everything we could throw at them because we decide to spend our antibiotics on agriculture and so on instead of protecting the lives of people. We suspect massively reducing the either the political incentive for countries to do this or the capacity for them to do this by taking away the resources by making them not part of the international organizations anymore would massively benefit these individuals. No, I just want to impact this before we move on to the next part about enjoining trust. The first is that in terms of scale, this is a policy on a chargantuan scale cleaving across hundreds of countries and ensuring that health resources are more adequately allocated and equitably allocated to thousands of the world's most poor. But secondly, in terms of gravity, this deals with some of the most vulnerable, those in rural areas without access to effective health care resources, those who are old and cannot take vaccines and rely on herd immunity. These are the people we protect. Notably, this also has a secondary benefit we think is equally important in the sense that the creation of a court causes trust to arise and increase overall investment and participation in global health. The authored refrain is that these countries are ineffective. In the sense that they are toothless, even if a relevant organization tells you to do something, you're unlikely to follow it. Moreover, politicians want to be sure that they can hold other politicians to account. So they will likely to manifest their will through this court and moreover, no politician wants to look like they will fear like they will be imprisoned for committing a health crime. Which means that they will also increasingly participate in this court. This means that we have way more money for operations from local forces and participation in this international organization. Which means that we amplify any of the benefits we provide earlier and they seem to be pretty big benefits. The end of this first argument is quite simple. We're closer to saving the world. Secondly, this is also principally important and principally legitimate. We suspect an argument to come out if you might subvert the democratic will of people. There are four reasons why this doesn't happen and notably why there's also principally different thing to do. The first is that this organization is consented to participate in the organization and the ratification of such a treaty and a court. But moreover, they vote in politicians that do the negotiating for them. Secondly, the health care that we propose is a fundamental right that exists as a precondition for the fulfillment of democratic will. If you are dying, if you do not have access to goods, it doesn't matter if you might hypothetically access your will in the future if you are not able to access that because you don't survive. Moreover, an effective baseline in the first place is necessary regardless of whether or not the democratic will is important. States have a responsibility to opt into situations where they allow for the preconditions to that will to exist and manifest in the first place. Fourthly, we also identify that on the balance of rights, even if you fulfill your democratic will as a people, this often comes at the balance or at the cost of other of the democratic rights that other individuals might have. So you as a country, as a Western country, might be okay with having, you know, very not stringent. That's the opposite of that very lax quarantine measures, but people in the surrounding countries who might be harmed by the infections that come out might still not have access to democratic will and might have not consented to that in the first place. There's often very difficult to for countries to face. We all suspect there are two separate principled reasons as for why we think this is very, very good. The first is up on the level of utilitarianism. This deals with benefits on a gigantic scale in the sense that thousands and thousands of people's lives who do not care a whit about democratic will do not care about principled legitimacy without being given access to the lives. But thirdly, this deals with people on a scale or inordinately into the future to say future deaths of pandemics. That is to say future deaths to superbugs from antibiotics, people who would not have to spend massive amounts of money in order to support a government welfare policy in order to support in order to support a basically overburden and basically toppling international health system. We suspect that these benefits are also quite large for three reasons. First is that there's substantially more likely to be people in the future. There are populations growing over time. Secondly, these people have no consent to what happened over the past and as such we have a responsibility to create an international court for these people in the future and thirdly is that we are taking mutually exclusive resources away from them. Which is why we should care for them. There are two reasons why opening government wins this debate. The first is that we explain why we saved the world and secondly we explain why there is no other possible choice. Affirm.\n"

                "content": "David tries to preempt why this court is going to look good. Unfortunately, he does it quite generically. But all of the other criminal courts which exist today, including the ICC which controls the implementation of post-conflict reconciliation and things like this, the ICJ which controls the implementation of international law, which presumably countries have the same incentive to have a say in as he says they would. Here are all based on opt-in, opt-out treaties that you can leave out of with no ramifications. The way here is clear. The influence you would have in such a body is quite diluted, insofar as you are only one of the members, specifically augmented by the fact that the countries that are the most likely to not want to comply are the country with the least amount of resources to be able to comply with these regulations, notably less developed countries. Which means that their influence is, in and of itself, a priori smaller. Therefore, the risk of persecution is more approximate and more likely than you having influence, which means it is incredibly likely. Now, the countries which cause the most harms, as per Opening Government's framing, are also the countries which are going to be likely to want to minimize risk and harm in terms of persecution and not opt into this court. Which means they a priori have a lot less efficiency in achieving their harms. But it also means, on the comparative, that the countries who do opt-in are those who have no trade-off. Those who are able to enforce these policies already, which means two things. One, there's a relatively small delta already. But secondly, it also means that these countries are going to have a disproportional say within the decisions of this court. Before I move on to why that's bad, let's make it clear that there's no analysis from OG as to why this court has the ability to dictate global healthcare policy, it has the ability to prosecute. No analysis on the likelihood of why it's key in providing health resources globally. Why scheme providing access, therefore both their impacts are minimized. But also unclear why the extent of the influence or say that countries would want to have in this court in the first place is likely. What kind of decisions do we think the court is going to make based on the characterization? We provide these are going to be biased and/or irrational decisions. First of all, we think insofar as western countries are the ones that are most likely to have sway due to their political power, but also due to the lowest trade-off of them opting in because they are not getting prosecuted because they have the resources to implement these policies. This means the application of western standards to less developed countries. Not the ability to go into full lockdown is contingent on the development of your economy. On your ability to transition to the internet and online economy, the digitalization of your country. Many countries physically cannot do this and to keep their people alive. They need to balance between lockdown and economy. This is contingent on the ability to finance more expensive studies, very often. You have to breach ethical protocols to develop medicine for things like malaria and dengue if you don't have the resources to do otherwise. You have to finance expensive bureaucracy. You need to have on-the-ground street-level bureaucracy which is going to do oversight of these policies, many developing countries don't have that. What is the weighing here? The weighing is that the many less developed countries have a necessity to breach these policies in order to be able to implement any kind of healthcare policy. Which means that you put in between a rock and a hard place of deciding between prosecution and the health of their people. And if you do efficiently prosecute, you make them less able to implement any healthcare policy in the first place. But secondly, insofar as the countries deciding these policies are those who are least fucked up, I didn't have less knowledge of what is happening on the ground and therefore more likely to implement negative standards because they do not have the oversight of what's going on. But secondly, know that there are both corporate and political interests. Not that the pharmaceutical market is an incredibly competitive one. Which means corporations have a market incentive to push for prosecution of companies or leaders in the developing world for developing specific types of medicine, which may be more accessible or maybe a competition to them generally. But there's also political influence, not too much. We've been cheating on the Chinese vaccine like Sinovac. It's horrible or Russia does not provide, you know, research for their vaccines. Sputnik is incredibly dangerous. Although, by the way, they did. Or Cuba researching four of their vaccines. This means that insofar as governments are just beholden to corporate lobbies, insofar as getting donations from these lobbies is a prerequisite to being able to run a national campaign in the first place and reach your electorate. This means there's going to be a huge amount of political pressure to lobby against companies of countries that are within the developing world and to portray them as having bad standards or is not complying. The consequence of this is that insofar as very often their only way to get healthcare provision to their people is to have this done locally because it reduces shipping costs and reduces dependency on the West. And therefore also the ability of the West to leverage against them. You're removing this from them, which means that insofar as they have a local capacity to control healthcare issues. You're making it worse. So the countries which are already worse off already have a lower amount of resources not just get their people dying. And I think this directly flips the comparative of the Opening Government. What is the comparative of the other side of the house? Not only do they create an incentive for leaders to cover up crises, which is just mitigation to their case insofar as they're going to get less successful persecutions. It also means you incentivize less cooperation with WHO or even countries leaving it. Because what is the comparative? The average citizen within the electorate doesn't know what the WHO does on the ground. The comparative for a leader then is that it is easy for them to formulate a populist narrative of this is another western-centric organization implementing measures against us. Note how countries within the developing world reject the IMF even when its measures are good for them then try to comply with this, which means that they're more likely to leave the WHO because their electorate will not react against this. However, the consequences are going to be quite palpable because you mean it means you get less access to grants, less access to medical trials, less access to medical provisions, less cooperation with NGOs on the ground who are necessary for things like vaccine efforts. Which means that the consequence is twofold again more people die. But secondly, I think you create a perverse trade-off for these countries insofar as they have to either choose between leaving the WHO and not being prosecuted to politician selfish incentives or choosing between not implementing the only policies which work within their countries. I think a clear comparative is here. There are other mechanisms to do this. We can export the generic medicine at low prices. We can earmark development aid on the conditionality that certain conditions are met. We can give them access to specific research grants. We can give them targeted access to patents. Why is this important? Because if there is an incentive, as Opening Government concedes, to solve these healthcare problems, I think that these countries and the West realize it anyway. Which is one why it's likely that the West will do our alternative mechanisms. But secondly, all of the harms positive by OG in terms of superbugs, in terms of antibiotics, the leaders in developing countries or less developed countries are aware that this fucks up their economy. And that shapes the comparative in this debate. Before I move on to why, Closing Government.\n\n> POI: Do you oppose humanitarian intervention to stop genocide in all cases, considering it is a time selectively used and colored by the politics of great power states?\n\nI think the answer to that comes in how well it's done or how well it's not done. I've explained what this will be done badly. Moving on to why we think this harms these countries. Not that the countries in the developing world are unaware that they want to solve these problems. The comparative is they often don't have the resources that I've explained. What is the comparative of government? They prosecute the inability to comply with policy. They do not provide a mechanism as to how they make these countries better able to comply with that policy. The alternatives we provide actually enable this and the same mechanisms as to why there's a western incentive to solve these problems. Works as to why the west would do our alternatives, therefore dissolves it better. But they also think the second reason why opting into accord is worse is because I think it reinforces narratives of colonialism and anti-westernism, which makes countries less likely to comply. Leslie, I just think this reduces global buying in health care measures. We currently live in a world where COVID has created an amalgamation of conspiracy theories, living in a dystopia which people were never faced with before has created a huge amount of narratives as to why there is a global enslavement plan. The creation of such a court gives a huge amount of munition to anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. Say yes. This is true. They're literally trying to prosecute the people who do not want to execute the global plan. Not how many people did not pick AstraZeneca because black cloths were presented as a plan to cull the global population. Create a global court and you feed into the new world order idiocy. But it's ruining the COVID vaccination plan right now. I am so proud to wear the scarf and to oppose.\n"

                "content": "When Australia initiated an inquiry into Pengxu and the Wuhan Institute of Virology to determine the origins of COVID-19, whether or not it was a spillover hypothesis from bats or pangolins, or whether it was a lab leak hypothesis from the largest storage of coronavirus samples in the world, China retaliated with significant sanctions on meat and other basic goods. It is disgusting to see how your life is literally put at risk every single day, on the basis of some concept of democracy or on the basis of some trust towards the state, or on the basis of leaders that you want to be able to elect because you elected them for other benefits, but you didn't elect them on the prospect of you dying. And that is why the threat to killing more individuals is the most important thing in this debate, and we cannot stand for that. That's why justice has to have teeth, and we have that at Gov. I'm going to talk about two things in this debate: number one, why this improves the capacity of the WHO and why the WHO becomes better and better on our side, and secondly, a lot of response to the LO. Firstly, why does this improve the capacity of WHO? Because remember, opposition is going to make the argument that this is the perception of WHO being very elitist, very Western-centric, and not having a lot of funding from many countries because only rich countries fund it. And then many of these things, different things, make it harder for WHO to operate. This specific mechanism, an international court, is going to make the WHO better in capacity in three significant respects. Number one, the litigation process that a leader of opposition was worried about, like the problem of all leader of office that they assume that individuals and leaders will always want to delete evidence. But that's always going to happen at the point in time where the pandemic becomes longer and longer. It's harder for you to track the evidence as the evidence gets buried over time or because the scientists are able to go into hiding. Having the ability to inquire and formalize these investigations very early on, even on the basis of speculation, gives us the pressure to give this data to the WHO. This is the preservation of evidence. More individuals and whistleblowers going to the ICH (this is the International Criminal Court on Health, by the way) because they can get many of these benefits and they can get many of these individuals to buy in. Even opposition parties internal to these countries are also willing to buy in on our side. The ICC is able to do this because it incentivizes like people and communities to overthrow many of the dictators and authoritarians within their countries because they will turn them over, and those same authoritarians are willing to give themselves up because they don't want to die as well. So this is also a symmetric incentive for many of these individuals to buy in. Number two, the pressures. I mean, the example here is the Hague ruling, right? Even if we have like a map of the South China Sea. That's a good thing because for the WHO, that means more data that they can use for other clinical trials in the future. Number two, the pressures on other states to join in also creates an internal check and balance process for to make the WHO more globally representative. So the WHO will have more info on whether or not you can use face masks or whether or not face shields are bad. And you can have more information more and more, like how the WHO did when it learned that COVID was actually airborne. So we're how like even if we have a little bit more hesitant WHO, we're able to fact-check those confirmations more and more, and you don't have to have this back and forth process of whether or not the WHO actually recommends that you should mix these vaccines against each other or vix don't have a third dose or have a fourth dosage because all of these information changes, and that's why we can change this with our process. But three, other countries do want to compete for a seat at the table. So you can leverage over the other these countries like the China versus US debate and their ability to have a vaccine race, which is phenomenal for the distribution of vaccines across the world. So this is also one way the private sector and the public sector cooperate through the WHO, through COVAX, and through the unique distribution that happens because of the International Court. Um, I think a POI from closing opposition.\n\n> POI: Yeah, we'll not have enough resources as a country or not having enough capacity to follow these regulations. We have sufficient defense in this court.\n\nUm, so well, it depends on the court, right? But I think it's that the recent instances that we're talking about is if the WHO gives you funding for whether or not you're gonna implement antibiotics or not, and they significantly tell you not to do that, then there is capacity for them not to do that. Right, and I think that's very definitely valid for you to give in that court. Um, Leader of Opposition says that the ICC has failed in any of these instances and it's like to feel in this side too. Um, two responses: number one, health is much more non-partisan and is supported by a vast majority of these communities and other states rather than gore. Crimes being significantly disputed or history being disputed, and number two, we're talking about instances of significant corruption or misuse of WHO funds or even significant like misinformation that is taken away from citizens. In this context, like the Wuhan, um, like the lab leak conspiracy that people do not have information on. LO says that you have to breach protocols to develop these vaccines. I have two responses: number one, this actually can cause significant local distrust within your state because the leader populist leader might think it's a good thing to be able to do a breach of protocol. But it actually makes it worse internally within those states, like for example, the vaccine hesitancy in the Philippines with the dengue vaccine scare because they said we want to have this vaccine rolled out now to be able to stop dengue in our country. But what happened is it caused some side effects for some individuals because it was the FDA approved and approved by WHO. So it caused the spiraling effect of many of these health crises within the country. But number two, even now today, we make less of these circumstances happen in the first place because as much as possible, these courts and trials are going to be given to the ICH. Number three, LO says that you can probably, you can't prosecute people. Like you just literally can't prosecute people because the WHO is never trusted. Two things: number one, if states don't think they will be prosecuted, that is the reason as to why they'll buy in very early on into our policy. And that's why it's like it'd be more effective because they want to give more funds to WHO so that they can be able to implement and prosecute other cases in the future. But number two, now we put teeth to be able to give this court so that more individuals can be punished on our side as well. Hello says that oh, many of these policies are accountable to corporations and maybe these politicians are already bought by them. If that is the case, then you are saying they are indeed subverting the will of the democratic people and they're not doing this for the just interest of those individuals and therefore you have to have a greater principle as to why the state should intervene or why there must be a global crisis. And other regional actors should have a say in this matter. Which is why the democratic will of other states and their public health and safety is also more important in this case. But number two, corporations also want less instability in these instances because we also say that private incentives are there to make vaccines more safe to be able to as much as possible give that when the public safety sector is failing. And that's why you're also able to mitigate those processes on our side. Lastly, Hello says that they can, you know, you know, the use of populist narrative to be able to purport this and these policies in the real world. Number one, they already do that right now. Look at Bolsonaro. Look at the territory using a strongman narrative to implement draconian policies in these nations. I think the reason as to why it's worse on their side is because there's no ability for you to prosecute these leaders in the process right now and during the pandemic or even after the pandemic. So you can get this information. But number two, a lot of this trust is also lost on the WHO on our side because people actually trust doctors more than the police or the military on our model rather than them being able to implement the quarantine restrictions on their side. Hello last says that they can be accountable on their side. Um, I don't think this is true. Number one, the alternatives you posit of targeted access to patents is not much exclusive. We can also implement that on our side if the leaders are also incentivized to, you know, care cater to the will of the people then they will join our model as well. So our model is effective. Thank you everyone.\n"

                "content": "No large incentive for domestic government to deal with the pandemic in the best way as it can. As the internal incentives of the country, because there are negative incentives for you if you mess up a trial, if you mismanage a pandemic domestically. Therefore, there is no defense of no resources because the status quo or whatever closing oppositions. Because this is literally the status quo by these countries do not enforce these regulations because if they could, they would want to enforce them because this is politically beneficial domestically. Therefore, the comparative of lying and disclosing on their side of the house, as I recognize, but given that this incentivizes countries to cover up more as the response might be persecution. Recognize, therefore, that the time sensitivity of this argument is very important. If you can fix the cover-up of having digging out bodies in crimes against humanity if it happens. Comparatively, if the pandemic is mismanaged and covered up and you can't ask for international help because you are going to be, then this is a problem which tears down a huge part of opening government's case. But recognize on the courts, they have no fiat to say what the courts will look like. The consequences of opt-out are largely developed in thin speech. They have very little responses to this. Biases internal pressure by richer countries and corporations are also not dealt with, and there is a disproportionate influence of larger and more developed countries for the mechanisms which we outline that there is a higher, there is a lower cost to you opting in comparatively to countries which are not like having these national regulations upheld right now. So look at also the financing of who. I mean, like, yeah, OG recognizes this, but they don't put any sort of counter-argument. If I know the financing that is pulled out by the United States. Like, it's a big problem for who, why they wouldn't have this proportional influence or how this would actually happen. So they're the ones who create norms, but look, I recognize their preemptives here by opening government. I just pointing out that we had a huge amount of argumentation which wasn't responded to as well. But look, even if you buy all of the preemptive that countries have an incentive to opt into these programs to influence them, blah, blah. Just ask yourself, why are they not then opting into similar organizations such as the ICC, such as the WTO like courts and all of this. Recognize that there is no responsiveness to this implementation from our side of the house. But also that large corporations which are forced by national regulations to follow these protocols do not have an incentive to influence the governments and why governments have an incentive to make this political and unrealistic requirements in an effort to boost their domestic production and export of medicines and their pharmaceutical industries as well as their hospitals, research centers, etc. Similarly to what happens with political incentives in similar courts such as the WTO courts or ICC. But it's often not who is right but is this beneficial for the interests of the United States to try and serve or not? Is it beneficial to increase the tariffs of steel or not in the WTO regulation but also on increasing global healthcare benefits? Recognize there are largely three reasons why countries which do not abide by this are doing this in the status quo because they recognize that there are global benefits to following this. Because first of all, there's a collective action problem. Secondly, they might be undercutting regulation for their own benefit and thirdly the costs are too high. Recognize that countries who are richer can offset and do indeed trade off these things efficiently with safety in the status quo such as we call it. But there are more stringent rules, but also other policies as climate change. The problem is that countries which are less rich do not have the ability to do so. Therefore, the characterization is that the countries most affected are unable to follow the protocol. Or there are high trade-offs that they are facing when following the protocols and they are prioritizing their own well-being as opposed to the well-being of the global community. But recognize given that their own well-being is a bigger benefit for them than the spill-off effect of the big international global benefit. This largely benefits the richer countries which do not have these internal costs but have the external benefits of less antibiotics used, etc., etc. So the comparative here is that they are unable to conduct high standard trials, unable to educate and introduce enough measures to reduce antibiotics usage because of less hygiene conditions in their hospitals, because of a less educated population, because of less availability to diagnose differential treatments and disease such as if this is viral or bacterial. So this is a huge part of the reason why they are doing so and not to try to undercut costs in a large amount of circumstances or because they cannot solve the collective action problem. But rather because they have the incentive to basically benefit their population. But also recognize therefore that this is very important. Please note that there are negative consequences for your country if you engage in this, right? I mean already proved this they don't dispute this therefore the trade-off here is that the external costs to other countries is the one which you de-prioritize so that you prioritize your internal well-being. Why is this legitimate and countries are allowed to do this? Because the opposite thing happened that gave them the upper hand which they are using right now. So for example development of medical industry pharmaceutical industry and the economy was oftentimes contingent on the not internalizing the negative effects to other countries. But just looking at your own benefits such as pulling doctors and researchers from developing countries so that they go to develop countries over there controlling the medicine market. Industrial development that polluted these countries and the globe while they were still being underdeveloped the exporting of instability for internal political purposes and things like this the monopolization of the pharmaceutical market. So it is in very essence the same things which developing countries are trading off now which the developed countries were trading off in before and this is why in the end they got to a position where they basically would do this and they are in in a position to do so right now. But also the comparative from opening government is the one with more stick but less carrot because they don't prove that it is enough to actually make countries enforce the policies. But this also decreases the incentives for countries to nudge and offer carrots to countries to do this. Which is where I'm going to go engage next, but I want to take a POI from CG.\n\n> POI: Well, he says you stay because you want help from the WHO. OO says you leave because you don't want to get punished. Why isn't the obvious answer here to prevent this situation in the first place by creating global political buy-in for prevention strategies for the next pandemic?\n\nLook, this is what I'm going to come to next, but recognize that it's not so black and white. Some countries might stay, some countries might leave, but the problem is that you are making them unable to do the trade of which they are making right now, which is in their interest. That's the bottom line. What are the negative consequences? Is there a way in which we can increase the compliance of these things in status quo without the court joint finding processes, cooperation with WHO, removing IP and patent laws that benefit developing world, sustainable development goals by U.N., and development aid that is connected to increasing compliance compared to here? But this is more expensive and has a bigger cost that is incurred by developed countries in the status quo compared to just making regulations, which means that you can prosecute it if you do not comply with it. Therefore, this has all of the incentives, both internally but also in a way which is easier from your perspective as a developed country to use this more often than the ways which are more costly to enforce the compliance of developing countries. Therefore, this is a comparative in which we prove that this is beneficial, basically in a way on how you can achieve some of this sustainably with more costs for developed countries, less cost for developing countries. So, thank you, folks.\n"

                "content": "Okay, so I know the majority of people in this room have this existentialism rooted in Bojack Horseman, Rick and Morty, where existence is pain in my head and stuff. But what I'm gonna tell you is existence is pain for people who don't have food to eat, who don't have health care, who don't have all of this stuff. So even insofar that they can claim that some of the people in this society might not be content, fully and fully self-actualized and all of the stuff, we believe that the most important thing in this debate is not to torture people but not allowing them to have food, meaningful, how do you say, basic necessities, which is like the lowest people in our society currently. What I regrettably, Uncle, has opened my minds to in this debate is that this is not the book, this is a debate. So everything that they might know from reading a book, which I also know, still needs to be proven and still needs to be weighed. So you might know what happens in a book, don't spoil it to people. You still have to prove your points on your side of the house. So you might know ABC and other types of it, but the world can look like people indoctrinating you into believing like collectivism and completely being content with what you are, which is probably what is going to happen given the info slide on our side of the house. So framing this world is pretty much the same bar two things. First of all, that this is a stable world, which means that there is no change in social order. We're gonna prove to you by changing social order is not good. And second of all, that this is based the great big people basic necessity and utility, which is actually what wins us the debate outright. So first of all, why free will doesn't exist. Yay, cool. So we define free will as the ability to choose other outcomes for your life other than what is actually happening or what is ought to happen by random circumstances that you are plagued with. What are these random circumstances that you're plagued with? So every future decision and every decision that anybody's making is conditioned by any previous decision that was made overall and not just like decisions, right? It's like genetics, evolution, and social values that arose in like random order and stuff. It is all influencing what I am believing, why I'm here, where I am in this situation. So, insofar that people have the sense of free will doesn't mean that necessarily free will exists and it actually doesn't. But what we should care about in this world is then the utility of the people who are the most disenfranchised, who cannot express and who by random lottery and throw of the dice have received like punishment, eternal punishment of torture and a horribleness that is existence in abject poverty and stuff like that. So let's talk about these people. So notice that when material and physical needs are met, which is stated by the impulse like only thing that is constant and they cannot refute under our side of house, which basically means there is no abject poverty, but it's also basically there is no poverty because like majority of people who are poor also don't have their needs fulfilled as love it. But let me translate that into human language for people to understand, probably, yeah. So what does this mean? This means less hungry people, less people who need healthcare, who are dying and stuff like that, and less people who need to take up loans in order to cure their child from doing something. This might most, I'll ask healthcare, you're talking about how to say something, it is basic, but notice that when you're hungry, this is basically somebody inflicting a pain upon your stomach, upon your guts, and you feeling horrible about this and stuff like that. Notice it also biology kicks in, right? Like this is something where you cannot control your hormones that are completely changing the way you're making decisions, you're making whatever, whatever it is changing your outcome and you're in your state of mind. So it's not only a physical pain that we want to avoid by all costs because it's biologically rooted if you want to avoid pain. But what I can posit to them is, would you torture terrorists if it will lead to a better outcome? Defend that in your leader of the opposition speech, please. Okay, but like, but it's also about psychological pain that people are experiencing from feeling of the hopelessness or courtesy not having the basic needs fulfilled under their side of a house. This is on our comparative, at least the lowest people on both or the both sides of the house is like much higher on our side of the house and we don't have abject torture. So they might still say, ah, but there's still some harms on our world, but nothing is as harmful as you being hungry, as you dying from hunger, as your kid dying from a disease that was completely preventable. It's happening in majority of Western liberal democracies. I mean, healthcare is still an issue. Why the heck are you doing this, America? Yeah, okay, so, so that's one. Second thing, why is changing the social position is first of all non-comparative, but second of all not good, even if they prove that it's a comparative. First of all, notice that system in their side of the house in status quo is rooted in couple things. It's basically capitalism in Western liberal democracies. But what does it mean? It's connected by vastly different interest in a vastly different complex systems that are, how do you say, anti-fragile to change and stuff like that on their side of the house, which means that some things might change, but they are minute in comparison and the system pretty much stays the same. But even if it changes to the certain and they like also lots of people that couple of more mechanisms, let's prove it a bit more stated. Lots of people have status quo bias. Lots of people fear change because the majority of people, how do you say, don't like and fear the change is something that can bring them something that is worse than they have in the status quo. So the people who might want to change are people on our side of the house. What change would they want? Is this change that we are proposing under our side of the house? People who do not want change on their side of the house and who want the things to stay constant are people who are pretty much already have these basic necessities fulfilled under our side of the house. So insofar that people want revolution, they want revolution to lead to our world. The problem is on their side of the house, the revolution is pretty much uncertain. Yes, opening.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nSure, it has reduced. I don't care. There's still poverty. There's still abject poverty. People are still dying from unnecessary things. I don't care if you prove 50 hundred years and stuff like that. Is that you're gonna solve this? We do it in a poof, by the virtue of the motion being set and stuff like that. So they just compared the hardness that they have to go through versus a poof from the info slide. Okay, so notice the change in the society. Social system doesn't necessarily need to better outcomes for people. Notice the majority of revolutions that happened previously. I ran communist revolutions previously, despite what Harvard might have wanted you to believe in that finals. So yeah, majority, majority of revolution and majority of stuff is plagued by people having horrible interest in being self-interested, even if they want to change initially, like revolution eating these children and stuff like that. So this means that usually people who died the most after revolution died the most of changing the social order, like because social order is uprooting everything that we have, is uprooting the economy, uprooting manufacturing system and stuff like that, leaving a lot more people in poverty, a lot more elites on the top of the hierarchy, like it happened in every communist revolution under server house. So change is not desirable, it's basically non-comparative, and we eliminate poverty and torture on their side of the house. So please vote opening government. Thank you.\n"

                "content": "My happiness is not just a composition of my material and physical needs. In the darkest moments of my depression, the problem was not that I was alienated from the material world, but alienated from myself and my own sense of identity. Thank God for finding my aspirations and the social relations like Chin to help me out of it. The problem with the brave new world is that it alienates humanity from itself and makes it a slave to the slave master of the state. I'm going to prove three different things in this speech. First, I want to talk about why it is principally illegitimate that you have a brave new world. Second of all, I want to talk about practically why the marginal benefits are incredibly small and the harms are massive to disadvantaged groups. Lastly, I just want to talk about net happiness and human aspirationalism. So, what is the principle in this debate? I think the thing that is important to observe is that onside proposition, they place far too much trust in the state. The important thing is that freedom is relational. For instance, slavery is wrong even if you provide all your basic material and physical needs to that slave, even if you give them the right to travel. I want to pause at a thought experiment to you here. Imagine having a fence with a gate that is unlocked. You can always go through that gate. The more free world is the one in which that fence does not exist in the very first place because you can choose the options of what you want and you have no barriers to impede you. Why is that important in this debate? Because the world that the proper position creates is a state which can determine what system they have, a benevolent autocracy which you can influence by changing the human genome and by affecting individual social conditioning. I think it is a world in which individuals' autonomy, no thank you, and preferences are undermined. Why is it on the comparative that we prefer Western liberal democracies? Then you can collectivize the change. We recognize that it is an imperfect system, but it's a system in which you still have a massive amount of lower-class and middle-class people who can organize, who can protest, who can go to the ballot box, and that preference aggregation and the very expression of that preference is a basic good in and of itself. Furthermore, the basic protections that exist for things like the right to protest. Now, I know what they're going to say. They're going to say these preferences matter not at all, precisely because of the fact that preferences are arbitrary and the fact that you can fix these preferences is a good end of itself. What is the harm that comes from this? First of all, I want to say that in the status quo, the free will argument is relatively insubstantial because even if we have our free will imposed upon us and are socially conditioned, we have competing different preferences that are still acting. For instance, the pressure to be world champions for Chennai versus the social expectation that we should just relax and that is better for us. So, we always have multiple competing preferences and that state will always try and dictate and limit the options that we have. For one, I think it is important thought experiment to recognize, for instance, that even if an individual has a strong preference to, for instance, be a heroin addict, that does not mean that it is a meaningful preference. The utility machine that knows it talks about does not aggregate and express what is actually good for you. And the important thing to note is that preferences can have different weight, i.e., I can have multiple preferences in a counterfactual world. I can have a preference to not be the world champion, but that doesn't mean that it makes me as happy as the preference to be a world champion. So, just because you have a fixed preference does not mean that the utility that you get from that preference is any different. It is the same on both sides because preferences have different ways that they act upon you and different ways that you can be happy from them. Sure.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nOkay, but think about this. That is true for a subset of people, and maybe mostly in America, not in Finland or other places. You cannot take the worst-case example of Western liberal democracies; you have to take the mean. And the mean is a world in which you have pretty decent quality of life. So you can't win this debate on OG or CG by exaggerating that the US is really bad because everyone in this room agrees that the US is really bad. Talk about other Western liberal democracies, please. So, on practical outcomes in this debate, the first thing that I want to point out is that characterization as to why there can be change structurally. It is true that there will always be a critical voting block that can change these kinds of systems based on the structure of capitalism itself, i.e., large capital owners have to extract gains from multiple people in order to become rich. So, you have to have a large class of working-class individuals to be extract that money from. An important thing is, therefore, that there is a large voter block. No, thank you. That has some degree of power to influence it, and that is why you see socialist policies starting to be implemented in large parts of the world. Why the amount of poverty is quite small, and we can see you probably marginally win on the 3% of people who are extremely impoverished in the mean Western liberal democracy. We think that is unimportant compared to the impact that we're going to propose because we think in order for the opening government to win, they need to have a totalizing system of conditioning that a state who is afraid of their power being usurped is most likely in this characterization going to embark on radically empower radically powerful policies to try and indoctrinate for in people. So, for instance, proactivity separating social classes so that people do not see the inequality that exists within that system, putting them in systematically worse neighborhoods that even if their basic material physical needs are met, they're worse off, suppressing protests, and if any person chooses a protest, that 1% of people who are aspirational, those people will be cracked down upon and put into reeducation camps. Why is it necessarily the case that even with the conditioning that they talk about, you will still have that sort of agitation? There are two different reasons. First of all, humans are aspirational. We are the only species which can compare and understand ourselves relationally to one another, so we are able to see, for instance, that someone else is better off and that we want to be able to strive to that position. Even if I am in an objectively good position, for instance, I should be happy that I'm a world semifinalist, but you'll be damned if I'm happy if I don't. I thought be happy if I don't make the finals. So, that is important thing, and the comparative is a world in which you can use the ballot box to express that preference, that even if it's imperfect, you're able to have a marginal improvement on that and express the aspirational nature, rather than having to go through protests or other risky means. No, thank you. Stability is a bad thing, precisely in the cases that if we can prove the status quo is harmful, and you have a much higher burden to just say revolution can sometimes be bad. Look at the Hong Kong Revolution, which we posit if it was successful, would lead to a democratic system, so the end outcomes can be oftentimes good. The second thing I want to point out is that humans are social. No man is an island, and we place ourselves within groups and we understand ourselves within group identity. That is why a colony cannot understand themselves as an identity compared to humans. And the important thing to note here is that the fact that humans are social means that we construct our meaning, the ability to have social relationships out of your class is valuable. Just because Chinasin Emporian, I wish I could still be friends with him, but also suggests why it is that we are relational because we define ourselves in groups and oppositional to other groups. The last thing I want to talk about isn't that happiness. Even if you don't think that you're going to have strict crackdowns, we think it is still wrong because it is important that people long for more, and that is natural for what people have. We are not the homo economicus; we compare ourselves to one another rather than just on objective standards, as I've suggested before, and the huge inequality makes you feel relatively worse off and makes you feel unhappy. That's why more equal places that are poor, like Bhutan, are more happy places because there's no one to compare yourself to. The comparative in this debate is not perfection but is the hope and ability to change the system, is the idea that you can have some degree of influence in some kind of hope, and that gives you reassurance to make you happy and feel like every day is worth living, that you can wake up in the morning because there's a meaningful change that you can make. The world that we view is tied to our emotions, the lens we view our lives through is important, and the fireworks that come off when we are friends is something that is valuable. Remarkably proud to oppose, thank you.\n"

                "content": "One thing that we get from the info slide in this debate is the fact, \"Can I talk from the Africa?\" Okay, one thing we get from the info slide is the fact that people do not have the ability to rebel. If people cannot rebel and overthrow this social system that exists, there are two possible options. Option number one is that they are so satisfied, feel absolutely no need to overthrow the system in the first place. And option number two is that we import these things into their consciousness. As you say, we give them pills or we give them, I don't know, some neural input into their brains. It doesn't really matter. On both of these, we win. But note that if everything that Jason says is true, how people, how people, how they want freedom, how they have all sorts of different things that make them unhappy, this probably means that if we buy the premise of the motion, which is people are not going to rebel, meaning that the world has no chance of being as bad place as opening opposition is trying to present to you in the first place. Or their consciousness is going to be altered in the way so they don't, which is already what's happening in status quo because we are conditioned. Because we are conditioned by our neurobiology. Oh, but preferences can be wild. What's so wild and different? They're so important for us to feel happy. No, even in the status quo, we make preferences in relation to situations that we are pushing. I do not have the same preferences as my great-grandfather did. In fact, we have completely different preferences because he, at the time of his life, knew what he could expect for life. We knew that he couldn't have an iPhone. I know that I can have an iPhone. So, my drive for you, what he strove for is maybe to build a house in Belgrade where he can live. And then, and then my grandfather would inherit this house. Those were his preferences. People who lived in ancient Egypt had very different preferences than 19th century United Kingdom. Okay, we adjust our preferences to situations we are put in. And this happens even if things change suddenly, such as, I don't know, Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. Suddenly, if you're an aristocrat and now you're hiding in the basement, your preferences all of a sudden become a bit different. And since the conditions that put you into having these preferences are already random and opening opposition considers they're random, I'm really not sure what the comparative is on these preferences. Point second thing, we tell you what is the comparative in this debate is the utility. Because there is no such a thing as culpability or immorality because we are conditioned by what has been happened before in the timeline of our life. When I was born and then my parents raised me and then when they make some first active decision, let's go to illusion of an active decision. These were all conditioned by all the previous things and then every decision I make in the future is conditioned by every way all the set of previous decisions that are made. Moreover, we tell you are conditioned by genetics. You're conditioned by randomness. Maybe you've got some disease. Maybe a car hit and killed someone you love. Maybe black swans happen. System collapse. Economy splashes. People lose everything in economic. We don't know what may happen in life and what is conditioning this. I want to take closing for extension.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nYes, but if Jason makes the premise that in the status quo, people can achieve some change, low classes and middle classes, why wouldn't people achieve? Such people, such age of both sides of the house. But moreover, what we tell you is why this is likely to happen is because when we solve the problems of global poverty that does not only exist in the United States of America, but all across minorities communities living in Western liberal democracies, we get much more beneficial results and much more satisfied people. For people who are the most disenfranchised, note the comparative on their side of the house. Have nothing. They don't have. Their preferences are never fulfilled, according to the team in opening opposition, because they do not have access to the thing that their premises to even getting preference. Indeed, there are many people in Western liberal democracies who never travel to a foreign country their entire life. There are many people who take a mortgage in order to pay for healthcare for their kids, even if healthcare in their country exists. So maybe it is inaccessible. So you need to pay for something. So you need to pay for something in some different countries. Secondly, we tell you, in the lack of those basic necessities, what we are telling you is this: you live in a constant, stable state of pain, which is, by the utilitarian metric, the worst thing that can happen to human condition, because this is something that we can actually measure, that we can measure through fMRI, another new neuroscience engineering novelties that humans have been able to put. This means that if you don't have money to eat good food, so you have to go and buy at 7-Eleven every day, this means that you will have a stomachache. But all this is also applicable to every little thing that you're able to buy in life. Note that in the status quo, in all the back to liberal democracies, we can open crisis. So people who are dissatisfied with the way their life looks like and how they cannot escape this poverty. Why do people smoke crack? Rich people do not smoke crack. Okay, people who smoke crack are those who, you know, cannot just cannot get out of their skin of how difficult the situation is. On our side of the house, government, we alleviate that pain by the notion of the info slide. This is given to us. What they have to do is prove their thing. Oh, and then I want, I just forgot to respond to this point about slavery. You don't say slavery and get away with this. You're a slave because state coerces you. You know, state coerces me. If I don't pay my taxes, a policeman will come and pull me over. So he takes my money. And if I say no, I don't want to give you money, he will break my hand if it is necessary to take me off to the police station and to take this money away from me, as well as to all the laws that I personally have preference not to oblige. In the status quo, and I cannot change my citizenship. If I don't give me Singaporean citizenship, I will gladly take it and give my Serbian away. Unfortunately, in the status quo, this is not something that I can do. So we, I'm telling you that in the status quo, I am already a slave of the state because if I don't comply with these laws, which in fifty years we may find super immoral, the same way we look at Jim Crow's now that happened in the 1960s. Okay, only fifty days ago from some time distance. His slavery in this is not comparative. The comparative is how can you self-actualize and how the poorest of the poorest who cannot achieve in the first place what they want to achieve, how these people are going to self-actualize. What we tell you in this debate, the only way that you can adjudicate is by consequentialism. We are the team that brings you the best consequentialism. It doesn't matter whether my lack of choice is given from nature or from the government. Proud to propose.\n"

                "debater_name": "OO",
                "content": "I think it's important to peel back the euphemisms of genetic engineering and social conditioning because that seems to be opening government's magic bullet, and I want you to understand just how antithetical these things are to our deepest hopes and desires. First, it means alienating you from yourself. You do not have autonomy, you do not have dreams, you just need to be a polished gear in an unfeeling machine. Two, it means cracking down on dissidents because stability, per the first speaker, is purchased at the cost of imprisoning critics. Because if you so much as speak out against the regime, you were sent to reeducation camps. They say the motions light tells us people cannot rebel. No, check your phones. Point number three says there is no possibility of changing the social order. There might be, for example, no possibility for me to kill all of you. Does it mean I can't try? Does it mean I can't come screaming towards you and slapping all of you, even though I don't succeed? And we think that the most just like does not give them fear to say that people are didn't. Third, it also means didn't some of the most powerful, effective emotions in our human psyche that give us happiness: the removal of hope, of aspiration, and of the chance of rebellion. So at the end of my introduction, I asked you to ask them a question: at what price, yanko prosperity, the human soul? I talked to you about five things: why do people sacrifice material well-being for intangible goods like democracy? I put to you that factual claims like the Brexit vote, how people took back control even though they were materially poorer, or Hong Kong protesters who rejected their future as investment banking analysts and consultants so they could fight on the front lines for universal suffrage, are empirical evidence that material comfort is deeply insufficient for happiness. Life is a pursuit of meaning. Just surface raw existence without any further internal narrative is what increases the likelihood of depression and severe nihilism. That is why Bhutan is happier than Hong Kong. This is why people tend to be deeply unhappy in countries like China, in countries where you don't have the ballot, where you're unable to organize, because people feel that their lives are being led by someone else, that you are just a puppet in the capitalist machine with no capacity to have autonomy. So it is in their paradigm that they have more pain, they have more depression, they have more nihilism, they have more mental disorder. They say it second. This is the second part of my speech that people's preferences change over time and they are better able to reflect it. I'm not sure why they bring this up because Jason tells you that it is democracy that serves a preference-aggregating function. So I can accept their premise. Let's say people's preferences change over time, but that's why people's voting preferences, the review preference through the majority, also map onto changing preferences. But in their side, they have to lock in preferences at one time slice. They have to pull everybody, determine what people's preferences are, and then genetically engineer from that point onwards. It is their side that doesn't recognize that preferences change. But let's be clear, because I think all of you are wondering, what is the problem with being born with genetically programmed preferences? Because it seems to me that I'm doing a cheat, right? I'm taking an external perspective and applying it to a subjective perspective. So here's the problem. The problem of being born with genetically programmed preferences is that you don't feel autonomous, even if you may not actually be autonomous, because you feel that your entire life is led, strung along by deterministic things. So even if the world we live in is a deterministic one, at least we give ourselves the illusion of autonomy, that I know when I swing my hands, it is not some random law of physics that's causing me to swing my hands, and this gives me power to know that I control my life, that I am able to define my relationships with people, that I am able to be the protagonist in my own life story. But in a deterministic war, even within the subjective perspective of someone whose preferences are conditioned by the state, that individual feels like an automaton, that individual feels that they are being led by a state that is determined for them what their life plays out, even though their preferences are real to them. That is why Jason gives you the analogy of the heroin addict. Why is it that the heroin addict, in his moment of sobriety, even if you may not always be sober, really regrets taking heroin, even though those preferences are real? It's because the heroin addict realizes that their positive freedom is being curtailed, that they're unable to control their addiction to the heroin, they're being led by some external force, in the same way they are being led by the external force on their side, by the state. No, thank you. Third thing I want to talk about, maybe Yanko is correct, material well-being is indeed a precondition for happiness. I mean, I could see this is probably true, but first, look at Jason's mitigation about how in most liberal Western democracies, this precondition tends to be met, and we are on a path to improvement. This doesn't flip the point, it just mitigates. But I want to note here that a precondition is non-equivalent to sufficiency. So lots of people on your side have the preconditions for happiness. Good job, because very few people actually have the sufficient conditions for happiness. There are very few people who are actually happy on your side, even if you meet the relevant preconditions. So by their own utilitarian metric, we win. Fourth, on what Yanko says about pain minimization, utilitarianism, maybe it is not about maximizing happiness, it's about minimizing pain. But on your side, all of Jason's harms cause pain. The fact, for example, that I'm not allowed to feel hope if I'm droning away as a gear in that machine. The fact, for example, they have a higher likelihood of suffering things like schizophrenia and depression because I feel the state is the one controlling me, not myself controlling my own life. So on your side, you also have a very large amount of pain. But before I go on, yes.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nI think this is deeply elitist. I'm sorry because lots of individuals, regardless of the material conditions, genuinely do find value in their lives. Like the family, the friends, the jobs they work. Even if you might not think that somebody flipping burgers at McDonald's has a deep, complex, meaningful internal life, I assure you they do. Back to my case. So we think even on their metric, pain minimization utilitarianism, they lose because they have deep mental and psychological problems. Number five: slavery. I love what Yanko says. \"The state is coercive. If I steal the water, the policemen break my hand.\" Are correct. So the state is coercive, right? That is exactly the premise for why we should have to vote. Because the coercive power of the state is the justification for people having the ability to shape those laws. Because it is illegitimate for a state to have coercive power on someone if that someone is also unable to similarly reflect back on the state and stop the state through voting for an alternative political party or changing the laws. It is exactly that premise that feeds into Jason's argument. So thank you for proving our point that there is a principle legitimacy to democracy that prevents state overreach and also a principle legitimacy to the point that we avoid a relational inequality that creates slavery. For all these reasons, I have never been prouder to oppose.\n"

It implies that there are other factors beyond material needs that contribute to overall well-being. The Pro argument, while important, may oversimplify the complexity of happiness and fulfillment.",
            "The Con argument emphasizing the importance of individual autonomy and capacity for change for personal development is more persuasive as it appeals to the value of personal growth and self-determination. The Pro argument dismissing autonomy as an illusion lacks a strong rationale for why external circumstances should negate the significance of autonomy in personal development.",

The Pro argument about eliminating hunger and poverty is important, but it may not address the deeper psychological aspects of well-being and fulfillment.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive as it highlights a fundamental issue with the society depicted in \"Brave New World\" - the lack of individual autonomy and the suppression of personal preferences. This argument taps into a core value of many individuals, making it more compelling than the Pro argument which focuses on stability and satisfaction at the expense of personal freedom.",

The Pro argument focusing solely on basic needs and stability may overlook the importance of personal growth and relationships in fostering true satisfaction.",

            "The Con argument is more persuasive as it appeals to the idea of freedom being relational and incompatible with state control, which is a fundamental principle in political philosophy. The Pro argument, on the other hand, lacks depth and may be seen as overly deterministic in its view on free will.",
            "The Con argument highlighting how \"Brave New World\" undermines individual autonomy and preferences is more persuasive as it addresses a fundamental aspect of human existence and freedom. While eliminating hunger and poverty is important, the potential loss of autonomy and individuality raises significant ethical concerns that may outweigh the benefits of such a world.",

It offers a more holistic view of happiness and well-being, which can be more convincing than solely focusing on the negative aspect of lacking basic necessities.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive as it highlights the potential negative consequences of a state-imposed stable society, such as the suppression of natural human aspirations and social interactions. The Pro argument, while mentioning the benefits of stability, does not address the potential drawbacks or ethical concerns associated with such a society."

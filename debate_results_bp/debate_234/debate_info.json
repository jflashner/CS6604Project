                "content": "It is blatantly insulting that the IMF thinks they can make decisions better than the people of nations themselves. The simple case I will bring to you from opening government is threefold. First of all, it is extremely important for you to control things like subsidies and exchange rates in order to develop your nation. In the context in which opening opposition and closing opposition prove that this is going to coincide with your interests economically, I believe you will be able to convince them better when you have an incentive to do so as the IMF creating a better buy-in. But second of all, alternatives. If you are being told the only way you can get loans is to give up your electoral incentives, in other words, not give fertiliser subsidies to farmers, not give things like interest rates to people who need it, you will be voted out and moved to worse alternatives like China and local vendors. And third of all, financial volatility and white operators are crisis. First of all, some framing. Some governments are quite corrupt in the sense that their central banks to a large extent are captured by their own governments in the first place. Other governments are often quite more competent, like the government in Indonesia, which often has had an independent central bank people in respect for quite a few years. Note that this debate operates on both of these metrics. First of all, let's talk about OP's best case. Incompetent governments that require the IMF to make good decisions for them. The first thing I'm going to tell you is that they will simply stop taking loans, and it's extremely important to understand why this is the case. The corruption point is obviously not as important, because explicit corruption is often something that governments are willing to give up when they're having instability. What they're not willing to give up is their capacity to change anything at all within the economy. For example, even if I'm an incompetent government that thinks that authoritarianism is good and you can control the central bank, I still believe I can save the economy, even if that means I have to give up corruption in the process. So I don't think this POI works. First of all, why is this a tipping point that I'm just rejecting IMF loans and taking worse alternatives in the first place? First of all, note that if your future loans can no longer give you things like agricultural subsidies, the vast majority of your electorate is frustrated and angry at you. This looks like farmer's unions and trade unions. This looks like the narrative of the working class farmer that is extremely powerful in the media in the first place. As a result, the short-term electoral incentive overrules the incentive on opposition to get that loan in the first place, no matter how desperate you are. But second of all, note that this also makes you look extremely weak in nations where your actual strength against the idea of westernism is very important, because a lot of these are post-colonial nations. You know, the Indians don't really love the British telling them what to do. As a result, often it looks a bit bad when you're literally listening to the IMF telling you what to do, and things are extremely unpopular, and you're blaming them as an excuse in the first place. But third of all, it's important because even if there are competent governments who think this is a good decision in the first place, the incompetent ones will end up switching on side opposition, which is enough to win us this debate on the first picture. What does this mean? First of all, they'll probably switch to China. Note that China is still expanding the BRF. First of all, because their local economy has floundered recently, it doesn't mean they stop investing externally. They need to invest externally, because there's not that much growth happening locally. Secondly, they often have to give, like, double human jobs for exports into local businesses, or get jobs by building infrastructure elsewhere. So, expanding the amount of loans they give to other people. But second of all, it's because they need to show returns to the population, because the policy has been a threat. So often, they need to make sure these loans are tighter, and make sure the loans go to these people in the first place. As a result, often, Chinese loans will be taken by these nations that are often as cordial. As a result, there's a huge bad impact to this. The first one is obviously that their infrastructure often gets stolen, and they can no longer control their basic needs and assets in the future. But second of all, it's just a much more untrustworthy actor, because China's legal system is not independent, which means often the rates and the trade deals within them often get screwed over. But third of all, China is less likely to be a multilateral actor, so the resources that China takes over are not going to be connected by other nations that work within them. The second possibility is getting local loans. For example, you probably still need money to get subsidies to get elected, right? So you might loan from local banks. The impact of this is, first of all, inflation. This is what happened in places like, you know, Turkey, where obviously they were very, very anti the idea of taking more loans, literally just reducing interest rates in order to solve inflation, because they were making bad policy decisions. And so often the local lending made huge problems for the economy. But the logic of this is that if you take a huge amount of money from banks, which you cannot pay back, because you as a government often earn money back in decades, the people whose savings are in that bank often start to disappear, because they don't have the safety of making sure that they can pull out that money. And as this increases, the banks become more and more over-leveraged, trying to pay you back by lending from other international institutions. So it can cause the entirety of the economy to lose legitimacy, because any money any business makes can be taken away by the government because it desperately needs it. But second of all, all of these banks, when they keep lending you money, often become more and more leveraged to the point where if you don't pay that back, it can cause a bank run, because people can be afraid to give their money back to them, at which point often you risk a financial crisis as well. Second of all, what happens to competent governments and their deficits in terms of development and in terms of financial stability? Before that, there was an opposition.\n\n> POI: So all these signs point to, like, this is something of a really dumb decision for them. Why is it that they keep doing it anyway?\n\nBecause if the country defaults, then you get more money back, right? You have to keep taking loans, keep paying your interest rates. But second of all, this is about a capacity thing, right? The IMF cannot just control the decisions every country makes. On your side, you have to forcefully put these conditions in, and at that point, they can't just be like, don't go to China, otherwise we'll be made to do all this outside their control. Okay. Now, development and why it's really important to be able to control your exchange rates as well as your interest rates. First of all, this is often the only growth vehicle for these countries. Note the prerequisite to this is why the political context in these countries are good in the first place. I've already told you if it's often authoritarian and corrupt, then probably opposition has a bad impact in terms of authorities. The system is probably, to some extent, fair in the motion where this actually, like, this applies, there's no mistake. What does that mean? First, they know what's happening on a local ground. People understand which sectors need support and which sectors need subsidies. Often, that is fertilizers and agriculture. Sometimes it's not, in which case debate doesn't matter. But in many instances, it's important because these farmers need that money to keep selling in the first place. That means you can build up cash reserves to invest into the future. In the current context, this is even more important because guess what? The biggest shortage in the world right now is food because Ukraine has been invaded as well as COVID cutting off supply chains. So often, it's a really high rate to make money to sell these primary resources. But second of all, let's say you don't sell that many primary resources. You're not a farming nation and you're moving to middle-income countries. You want to move into manufacturing. As a result, often you need to also change your exchange rates. You might need to import more primary materials in order to sell that as a finished product for which you need your exchange rate to rise so you can afford those imports in the first place. You cannot do that outside opposition. You get all that optionality on our side. But third of all, it's important to provide capital controls because the risk on opposition is too much. The reason the East Asian financial crisis was such a big hit to the country was because when the currency starts falling to some extent and the economy is failing, people speculate on it. They buy huge amounts of it. This is what a market exchange rate means, by the way. As a result, if the currency falls 20% in Indonesia, despite the economy still being quite healthy, people speculated on the rupee until it came down 67% because that makes them more money. You cannot have capital controls outside opposition. You can control that on our side and stop this. This is immediately winning because exchange rates literally decide every single thing you do in your everyday life. At the point where your currency becomes devalued, you cannot buy goods or save money. Your savings are wiped out. You have nothing to turn in the first place. But second of all, investments within your country determine the interest rate. At the point where they say market exchange rate, you cannot take away that interest rate which means that often people can pull money out of your nation very easily. So often, companies are invested in because right now there is growth. The second is a harm. People pull out that money, which means the entire company can no longer function, causing the entire economy to often have huge shocks like perviatoric in the first place. The only way to control that is on our side. On that, I'm closing out.\n"

                "debater_name": "OO",
                "content": "Four broad things worth opening up in this debate. First, a point of framing as to why the lack of IMF conditionality induces unfavorable market conditions that cause serious harm to these countries, regardless of the existence of anti-corruption provisions. Second, why each of these policies are good in and of themselves. Third, why in the absence of these additional conditions, the anti-corruption reforms they talk about on their side become toothless. And finally, I'll explain why this makes countries more resilient to recessions with this policy. Before that, three extraneous responses to remove Guizhi from the round. Guizhi's first claims that countries on the margins are more likely to turn to China at the point in which some countries, which are on the fence between trading with the BRI and participating in things like the IMF, are now seeing that the conditions are too stringent. There are three broad, intuitive reasons why not, even disregarding the fact that there's things like status quo bias, governments that have close political ties with the West outside the IMF that induce them not to turn to China, and the fact that these countries all have economies that are interlinked with the West such that they don't want to turn to China to avoid pissing them off, even if it's the case, so they want to stay half-dependent on the IMF for those reasons. Firstly, China has significantly more limited resources right now. They're reeling from COVID, and they're also reeling from an internal inward war whereby they're developing their domestic market. Every investment they project outward trades off against Xi Jinping's capacity to reinvest locally and domestically. Sharjah says the exports become more competitive, and therefore they can reinvest the money from the exports domestically. The problem is people are buying far fewer, and inflation is up, and they're relatively less competitive compared to other countries. So it's unlikely to be China as an alternative. Secondly, China's also pissed off a large number of countries. The very stock analysis about debt traffic diplomacy whereby China seized a port in Gwadar, Pakistan, and also in Sri Lanka, and things like that largely dissuaded a lot of countries from trading with China. So for countries on the fence, they're very unlikely to say, ah, some conditions that require us to rule have few competitive advantages for our market versus China trapping us as debt and then literally stealing our port and occupying our land are two very different things. So the weighing is quite clear, right? Finally, if their logic is true, they're still at a competitive deficit with China. So if there are some countries on the fence that are really leaning China, and the status quo, and things like this, they're still going to be put off by the IMF by anti-corruption reforms. Why are anti-corruption reforms the most salient? Quite obviously, because anti-corruption reforms could force the political party out of power, and the people in these countries want to stay in power longer. Therefore, they are very likely to just turn to China on their side if that's something that happens. Finally, path dependency. It's very hard to reorient your entire economy toward China. If you do this, you likely piss off the West and lose out on Western investors as a result of moving toward China. See if Pakistan, when they did this, and the port in Gwadar thing, and things like this. But more importantly, I just think it's generally quite bad. The final thing I think that O.G. then says is that you need to control your eastern trades. The problem with this is this just scares off massive amounts of investment intuitively. Capital controls are often very, very bad. They don't just protect domestic industry. They're used to keep domestic and corrupt monopolies in power that can then pressure the government to get preferential regulations on their side of the house. On our side of the house, we break those capital controls to allow more entrance into the market, which induces competitiveness, while simultaneously reducing the amount of money that these companies have to do things like lobby the government for preferential policy. The final thing I want to make is that banks become more unstable. It's very clearly and intuitively the opposite, right? Because Sharia says there is a lack of central bank credibility. If that is true, this means international investors are incredibly unlikely to want to invest because they are worried about the regime of the central bank changing fairly rapidly. The reason why the Mexican peso crisis happened was because international investors pulled out on massive Mexico at the point at which the government under Pinedieto set an interest rate peg to a specific point, and then the next government immediately reversed that. When you no longer can do that and you're set constant to market rates, this induces investor confidence. The point I want to establish in framing is that there are six problems with lack of anti-IMF conditionality, even if your anti-Mexican reforms remain constant. First, in the absence of policy to eliminate subsidies on fuel and fertilizer subsidies, you allow dominant firms to crowd out these vital markets. The reason why a single firm has been able to mobilize the Mexican market is because they are significantly able to take advantage of the differential in terms of subsidies to crowd out other potential firms to enter and create competition. Secondly, in the absence of setting your currency exchange rate to international market rates, there's less credibility in your central bank. The reason this is true structurally is because without the guarantee your exchange rate and your currency remain constant over a period of time, investors are more concerned about losing domestic capital if they suck away at them. But thirdly, market-based interest rates, rather than the comparative, crowd out the ability for businesses to get loans. Because when banks set interest rates preferentially and give better rates to some companies, this crowds out competition within the market to a vastly greater extent. But even if you have equal competition, when interest rates are not pegged to market, they cannot take into account when it's best to borrow, which makes it harder for companies with long-term time horizons to make plans when they want to take out loans, when it's the best time to take on debt. This predictability is the most vital. The second thing I want to do is explain why the conditions are unlikely to be so stringent that these countries can't meet them and they won't be reasonable. This is the most important mechanism. The IMF does not want to push countries away from receiving the packages because they face economic contagion as a result of this, a harm as a result of these countries not accepting the packages and then their economy getting fucked. Economic contagion spreads across borders and this causes harm to countries that receive the loan as well. Secondly, the IMF is made up of a large number of countries and is made up of a number of constituent governors from many countries. Therefore, there is likely to be a race to the median whereby over time the policy of the IMF congeals around a reasonable set of conditions and circumstances. The upshot of all of this is, and finally, they do have competition with China, so there's an incentive for the conditions to largely be reasonable. So they want countries to rely on them not to turn toward China not to impose really terrible conditions that governments just reject. The upshot of all of this are the structural reasons why it's likely to be good and not going to be absurdly stringent, like what they're defending. Second, why is it the case that these countries will still be receptive to these conditions? Firstly, people in power in these countries can gain credibility by appealing to this. They can point to a credibility induced by the West and North Korean power. But secondly, it dampens populism because we get more investment on our side of the house which can cause a feedback loop whereby they like the IMF more. But finally, I think that corruption is usually the most proximate harm because they don't want to defend or remove all conditions. So at that point, I don't think they get the benefit that they want on their side of the house. Why do we resolve investment inefficiencies in the markets of developing countries? This is the most important argument in this debate and it's logically prior to anything CEO can extend on insofar as this is the prerequisite for all of these countries to attain economic stability. The problem the state is put with investment is threefold. Investors lack market confidence about entering countries and setting up shop there and there's a lack of market-based interest rates because they fear subsidies, dominance, tenders, credit, competition, and so on. The second fear is a lack of central bank credibility as I've already explained. And the final fear is that many developing countries are transitioning away from manufacturing sector and toward sectors like information technology and things like this. The problem is that it's slowed down on their side when you have a massive amount of subsidies that a few dominant companies hoard which discourages competition and innovation. Why do we pick tolerant things? Before that, I'll take closing.\n\n> POI: Your argument is that currently people believe that these conditions are not met. These countries are extremely volatile. The IMF now says they will continue to develop these countries even if they don't meet those specific conditions.\n\nNo, this is what happens on your side of the house in the absence of conditions. Those are the investment inefficiencies that exist in the absence of this policy. Why do we get significantly more international investment then? I think, firstly, investors feel now more they are able to compete with domestic firms more frequently. This means they come in more frequently, set up shops, the government gets things like a broader tax base from the ability for these investors to come in and their benefits proliferate downstream, right? Because now people have more goods to choose from, more people have the ability to meet their preferences, more people have benefits to access goods and services that they otherwise would never get. But secondly, when exchange rates aren't floating and are rather pegged to international markets, investors are less worried about holding assets in the currency the country issues. What this does is then crop up the valuation of that currency. But it also means when they hold reserves in the local currency, it means they're more likely to keep profits in the country rather than reallocating those elsewhere. So international plunder, if you believe investment happens on either side, is substantially reduced on our side at the point where now countries have an incentive to keep the money in circulation within the domestic economy as opposed to just raiding it, exporting it out, and taking it away to the US or something like that. But finally, when you get more competition between firms, it means you have vastly more innovation within the country. This aids and speeds the transition process at the point at which these things happen. Why are these policies beneficial in and of themselves? We get decreasing monopolization on our side of the house, we get exchange rate consistency on our side of the house, and we get less implicit corruption, most critically, which is the final point I want to make. I'm going to do more on that, but where there's way less regulatory oversight, quite intuitively, there's more leverage to engage in kind of pay-for-play and under-the-table corruption that gets far worse on their side, so they don't resolve the problems that they want to, whereas we do. Thank you. Incredibly powerful.\n"
            },
            {
                "debater_name": "OG",
                "content": "The first thing I'm going to do is provide the economy is significantly worse on their side of the house, and that in and of itself is a way for us to win the debate. There's two things I want to flag up. Even in the best case in which development happens over time, the first thing you want to note is what Sharia said, which is to say you get rid of the ability for specific countries to hedge against things like exogenous shocks, which is significant because Matt is not an intellectual genius. I cannot predict whether or not the next COVID happens, whether or not there's natural disaster, at least with things, for example, like supply shocks, or just like any other thing that leads to the ebbs and flows of economic shocks, leading to specific countries being harmed. The distinction, therefore, is that on our side of the house, there's a high degree of flexibility because even if Matt is correct, that the IMF has structural incentives to make sure that things like interest rate or things like currency exchange is done at a fairly reasonable rate, or even more simple, even if the IMF is good, the local politicians are significantly better. A, because they have flexibility and they're able to move it around, IMF, definitionally by the impulse of it, has a one-size-fits-all solution. Unless I'm going to prove that India is the same as Bangladesh, I don't think we're going to win this clash. But second and more significantly, there's a plethora of reasons as to why politicians have good incentives, which leads back to just their claim. Honestly, I think it is a bit elitist and problematic to assume that a lot of these countries we're talking about don't have the ability to make good enforcement, but there are a lot of structural reasons as to why there are good incentives. Number one, oftentimes the way in which it works is that the politicians, or the individuals who work in the local bureaus, are the experts in these countries. So individuals, for example, working in the Indian Bureau of Economics, are the best people in India to deal with economic things. But second of all, there's ample electoral incentives, because it's unclear why economic growth is not a contentious economic issue, right? Like no one ever was like, hey, I'm going to sink the Indian economy now, please vote for me. Everyone wants the economy to be good, so there's automatically going to be a race to the top, and individuals on the ground have local nuances that help them determine whether or not specific policies are good. Which then was the problem, because on their side, big bad guy in the IMF gets to decide why fertilizer subsidies, for example, might be gone, or why specific exchanges were good or bad. On our side of the house, that decision was always with the individuals on the ground, and that was significant. But finally, and this is significant, even in the best case, the issue on their side is that the considerations are always economic. You know what else harms individuals? When social problems lead to individuals starving. When other types of issues that are not strictly to do with monetary policy, etc. make significant degrees of harm to your society. On our side of the house, politicians care about those, because if you have poverty, for example, that leads to you losing elections. So the consideration on our side of the house is significantly bigger, and therefore the individual politicians are going to be better. The way I found this argument is very simple. Massive amount of individuals suffer interim harms in which things like social policy cannot be immediately redirected, because the IMF arbitrarily imposes specific conditions on these countries. The flexibility odds for the interim harm to be better. This is logically harder than opening up, because even if you buy the long-term argument, people die now, people will be now, they matter, and as a result of that, we're probably winning on the principle there. But the second thing we told you, and this is significant, was just to say that the monetary stability and the perception that states have that stability was important for states to buy into the IMF. Which is quite significant, because if opening opposition is right, that China is on the wing, which by the way, I think Matt then self-contradicts in the LO, then where else do you get that money? The issue then was that on their side of the house, individual countries can always use the rhetoric that we want Indian sovereignty, we want sovereignty for these countries, and therefore not opt into the IMF. We get rid of all of those incentives for the very simple reason Sharia gives, which is that being corrupt is oftentimes a very scandalous sort of thing, and liberal countries don't want to be corrupt, so when the only condition the IMF imposes is whether you're corrupt or not, there is ample incentive on our side for massive degrees of opt-in, which is the logical prerequisite to getting the economic benefits as well. But even if you don't mind this, why is it that the type of economic development you've got on their side of the house significantly works? The first thing I just want to point out here is, they never prove that the money stays in, right? Like if a bunch of foreign companies come in and therefore start consolidating power, I think what ends up happening is that domestic firms die. Why does this likely be the case? Number one, often these big firms have first mover advantages. They have already established things, for example, like technology, they already have, for example, specifics, flychains, and all these sorts of things. But secondarily, they're oftentimes just able on the scale to appeal to a bigger market, and the asymmetry of power and economic economies of scale means that bigger companies that are coming in are oftentimes going to be significantly more able to compete. But second of all, the reason as to why this is bad is because then this ends up crowding out domestic businesses. Because what ends up happening when big companies are coming in, because definition, they stand for things like free market, is that big companies are able to make sure that individuals on the ground either, A, just have higher prices in the long term because if you monopolize the market, you then are able to charge whatever prices you want, no thank you. But second of all, you necessarily retard the development of these local industries. For the very simple reason that if a consumer can choose between buying a cheaper product that is made by an MNC that's able to make that price cheaper because of some cost and stuff, they're always going to buy that. And as a result of that, the domestic firms are always going to suffer. What is the way up on this argument? The first thing I want to point out is, I don't think opening opposition ever has a path to victory in the long run. I'd like to just say, well, money now goes around the world. I don't know why this is a good thing. A bunch of American firms go to India, make massive degrees of profit, and then send that money away. I think that is a bad thing because it creates higher degrees of volatility in places like India. But second of all, it makes it far harder for these states to develop because as MNCs can flexibly move capital around, it just makes it hard for these states to plan how much tax revenue and all of these things they're going to get. But three, flip the argument on corruption. Because you know how corruption happens? When big MNCs are able to consolidate power and tell the government to do whatever they want. Otherwise, you're going to pull out. We're able to get rid of that because we can preemptively set up things, for example, like protectionism. This will allow our state of the house, the economy, overtime is going to be better. Maybe we don't get massive degrees of growth, but when individual governments who understand the local nuances can control the degree and the way in which that growth happens, we're able to create sustainable development, which is probably better not only on an economic term, but also in terms of people's feelings. Because if you have massive degrees of inequality, even if growth is good now, but now we're living in poverty tomorrow, that is not very good. Closing.\n\n> POI: So it sounds to me like you have two contradictory premises about the incentives of governments.\n\nEither they are super duper pushed by one particular block and rebellion might be threatened, or they have all the competence that is needed to make all the best decisions. They can be competent, but still pushed. The reason why they're pushed is because of opening opposition's policy. Thank you for pointing out that opening opposition is losing. Great. What is the long term and why are we able to win as well? The opening option here was that you've got a race to the immediate, and therefore that is a good thing. I want to point out, even if over time the IMF policies become better, our argument was that the lack of flexibility in and of itself was a harm. We're the two ways in which this pays out. The first is just the net amount of sum that the IMF has to work with over time decreases. Think about what happens on our side. Because right now, a lot of countries are performing suboptimally because they have to cater to the four demands on the info side. On our side, there is only one demand, and it's not even an economic demand, which means you're able to immediately do things like have protectionist policies, or immediately do things like restructure the way in which your economy works. So the ability for you to make that money back is significantly quicker. This is important because now you can pay the IMF back, which does three things. Number one, this creates a signal that the IMF says all we care about is anti-corruption. So you get higher degrees of investor confidence because people think that, no, these countries aren't actually that bad. The IMF approves of them. But second and more importantly, it also just means there's more money the IMF has at its heart. Because the issue on their side is that if these companies or these countries are failing, then they don't have the ability to pay back the IMF and therefore the IMF is working on deficit. But finally, this is important over time because often people don't work with the IMF because of a perception that the IMF speaks them over. We're able to rectify that by making it seem that the IMF is on your side. So don't turn to the other alternatives I started talking about are bad. At the end of the day, economic development is far easier on our side. Very happy to propose.\n"

                "content": "They presume that they can get out of policies because the politicians have optimal interests on our side. What I want to explain to you right now is even with the best interest, there's a structural incapacity to acclimate and harmonize those interests to create optimal market policies for everyone, including them. A few things. Why are these conditions likely to not be too restrictive like in Beijing? That tells you a few things. They have a few background in Beijing, the fact that they don't want them to go to China, and it's largely participatory. But two things as well. One, note that there's an institutional learning capacity, that is to say they've literally released reports saying you learned from other states in the 90s. But secondarily, it's about having aggregate information about other countries and the ability to harmonize conditions across the board. Even if you as a politician want to, for example, maximize the profit potential for your country, you cannot know or predict how another developing country is going to shift those interest rates and currencies relative to yours. Why can countries not make proper optimal decisions? Firstly, internal issues. One, note politicians at a structural level are short-termists that have short-term cycles. Secondly, the discipline is harder on their side because institutions, even if the incentives are perfect, are not fully or entirely developed. Even with independent central banks, it takes years to develop that institutional know-how and that independence. What is the upshot of this? They say, ah, they know their countries better. One, I think it's likely the IMF still has robust policy analysis and people on the ground to provide that info and that context. The issue that they don't engage with, Matt, is this inability to align selfish interests. They might say, I do care about my people and want to empower them, but they want to get elected in the next election. That is to say, there might be interests that they have to prioritize and gamble, but the one that they prioritize is the short-term one that isn't optimal. But here's the second issue that's more critical. There are external issues outside of the control of politicians. That is to say, there's coordination problems they have with different countries. That is to say, there's a prisoner's dilemma in information asymmetry through how another country is going to exchange their currency relative to yours and the kind of subsidies that they will put in their market that will affect the capacity for you to export your own market. Oh, and secondly, there's uncertainty for investors, because situations can still change on the ground quickly. What is the upshot of this? Even with the perfect government incentives, and even if they're not short-term, they cannot aggregate the incentives with other countries that leads to suboptimal international market conditions that affect everyone. The upshot of this is that these are the conditions that create the shots in the crisis they talk about. When a country lowers its prices so low, and then, for example, a tsunami hits or a typhoon hits, and then the market, they cannot sell to another country and fuck up the supply chain. In other words, even if they are angels, they are angels that cannot talk to one another, we would prefer to have a less reputable or more impartial devil that is able to aggregate the interest between those things. But secondarily, I think they are comparatively more susceptible to financial crisis on their side. Why? One, the volatile currency means that as that currency goes down, which they have an incentive to insure their export base, they want to export, then the crisis hits. It's harder for them to, for example, buy more reserves without liquidity, as opposed to if it was a market-based rate that they can consistently plan for. Secondarily, it's easier for countries to devalue their currency when it's floating as opposed to a fixed market rate that the IMF is able to do with multiple countries at the same exact time. And thirdly, they are more resilient to shocks comparatively more on our side because when the currency is so low, they are unable to, for example, provide goods and services for your people, provide subsidies for that company, then sell it to the markets they need. It's comparatively harder because your currency isn't otherwise worth shit. The top shot of this is that economic shocks might be symmetric on either side. The differences there are the conditions and product of countries misaligning interests and having incentives that are zero-sum with other countries. The IMF maybe doesn't have each individual country's personal best interest, but they have an aggregate best interest that is comparatively more able to harmonize, even if it leads to suboptimal decisions between some countries and them, for example, not making as much money as possible in the short term. Then they say, ah, you'll go to China. I think this is largely out of this debate. As far as one, all the stuff Matt told you. But the other thing I say is, one, they have a large amount of bad loans that they have that they've been trying to defer for the last few decades as they've been taking America's bad debt. Secondly, they can't be everywhere. They just can't be everywhere alone. Thirdly, they have a domestic-focused priority over their own citizens than to lend to other countries. Fourthly, developing countries cannot entirely reshape their economy to then engage with China more as far as they have different supply chains. Now, let me weigh investment, and here's why it's critical. The investment that Matt tells you is a prerequisite to development. Things like roads, electric grids, etc. But secondarily, it's far more wide-scale and affects a wider sector of the countries as opposed to domestic companies where even if they reserve more wealth, they don't have as much money as a foreign country. Even if, for example, you don't get to keep as much of the money, they give you the start-up capital that allows you to do things that trickle down, like build hospitals for workers or an electric grid that even if somebody isn't having a job, at least they can access the internet. But fourthly, these are generalizable. All countries to some extent here need international investment. The upshot of all of this is that even if they get to compare with more protectionist policies on their side, I don't know why it is comparatively better or way past the foreign investment that they otherwise need to upscale comparatively more. Even if they have more of the money and they have more of the pie, it is a smaller pie that is far less able to be redistributed to more people. Now, I want to gauge very clearly. Even if you buy that investment is symmetric, and countries want access to these loans, why are the policies that compel them to, in itself, substantially more efficient? One, subsidies pop up monopolies even if they are not corrupt. Why are they able to access these subsidies far more than smaller companies domestically? One, in tuition pump, they have more lobbying power to access it. But secondarily, even if you subsidize everyone equally, the marginal value of a subsidy is far greater to a bigger company. Why? Because they can use each additional subsidy to crowd out and pickpocket the markets that the smaller company wants to enter. Upsides, this engages with OO on monopolization and says why it is comparatively easier for them with the policies that I'm trying to prevent that benefits the bigger companies they are trying to root out. Before getting into the second piece of analysis, back up Kevin.\n\n> POI: Yeah, it's not clear to me why these subsidies necessarily favor just bigger companies because these bigger companies often don't use these subsidies to lower prices heavily on the local population.\n\nI just explained to you why they are able to weaponize it comparatively more than smaller companies, but the difference is that when you are able to comparatively reduce subsidies across the board, you are able to aggregate prices comparatively better. See the previous analysis behind that. Secondarily, this creates more avenues for inefficient investment and funding. Why? Firstly, currency arbitrage. When you have floating exchange rates, investors and domestic companies make money on price differentials with other currencies as opposed to making a better or cheaper good. So when there is a floating currency exchange rate that isn't harmonized, it's far easier for me as a person to say I want to start a business and make money by selling one good in another country and by purchasing into a different one because I can take advantage of the price volatility as opposed to actually starting a business that employs people and makes things better. But secondarily, these are more volatile kinds of investments. These currency spikes might be very profitable, but these are short-term businesses. These aren't things like the incentives we tell you about, an electric grid that has long-term profit potential. But thirdly, it creates worse trade barriers and tariffs. Why? Because subsidies are zero-sum against competing countries internationally. The option of this is that even if they benefit each individual country in the short-term, you increase prices across the market, and countries are not idolaters, even if some of them may be. They buy and engage with other countries. Their prices are affected by international markets. Look, the IMF is no angel. But if rather than one devil coordinating the market, then 20 angels that cannot communicate will have the same incentives. I think it's a clearer world.\n"

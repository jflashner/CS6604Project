                "content": "Wildfires in Turkey and across parts of America, flooding in Europe and Asia. The climate disaster is here for us to see. The world is burning, and we need direct action. Quick action if we are going to save the planet. Two points of framing: before I move on to what the counterfactual is, that all has to defend and tell you why we're better for the environment, but also better for the economy. Let's talk about the climate disaster first. I want to note that while attempts are being made, lots of countries are not fulfilling their promises or are slow to fulfill their promises. And the climate disaster is getting worse every single year. We do not have lots of time. We need to do something right now. The second thing I want to note is that central banks have a responsibility, but this is not going to be a huge change in terms of central bank policy. What does this mean? Biden's Green Plan? But also the plans of institutions like the World Bank or IMF already talk about green investment. What banks need to do, the responsibilities that they have. But secondly, I want to note that central banks have already changed the things that they prioritize throughout history. First of all, they wanted to do something about unemployment, then it shifted to inflation, both the financial disaster. It shifted towards ensuring system stability. Central banks always have different targets depending on what the economy requires, and we say that the economy requires the world to exist. But secondly, I also want to talk about the things that happen under their side of the house, which is to suggest that inflation is not something that only crucially happens under our side. The environment and climate disasters affect production cycles, affect the agriculture industry. They displace labor, all of these kinds of exogenous shocks also lead to inflation, crucially under their side of the house panel. The second thing I want to also note over here is what the comparative is that they must defend. I think the comparative that they must defend, if we are being generous, is that governments have to do this by taxation and fiscal spending and therefore support green companies in terms of what they do, instead of what we are likely to do, which is asset purchasing programs, which prioritize green companies. Banking rates being adjusted favorably to green tech and all of the kinds of mechanisms that we have under the policy that is given in the info side. What's the problem then with governments doing this? I want to note a couple of things with governments. The first thing is to suggest that governments do not have independent bureaucrats. One central bank policy does this, it's not for four years, it's for a longer period of time, not depending on political cycles or whether they go right or left. That's the first thing to note. But secondly, I also want to note that governments have their own lobbies, have their own sponsors, so on and so forth. So even if governments are investing in green tech, they might not be investing in the most optimal green tech. They might be investing in green tech that is most beneficial for them and is funding them. The third thing I want to note, especially with government spending through fiscal spending and taxation, is that it almost always comes at the cost of welfare or other programs where the government is investing because the government doesn't have unlimited finances. There are a few key problems with this. One, we always hurt the poor. But two, the problem is at the point which these people do not have social welfare or schemes that are protecting them, taxes become higher and higher and higher, people are much more likely to buy into rhetoric of climate change denial or that this isn't a serious problem, which also gives right-wingers a lot of scope to win elections in the future. I would also note that this is a huge problem in terms of protecting the environment. Also, I would also note that because we are using the finances of the rich, we are not hurting the poor right now when we're using money from central banks. But also, it is going to affect other banks that I'm going to show you. I would note that this means that the responsibility for fighting it is displaced. Now, first of all, why are other banks likely to do this or if the central bank sends this, why are we better off in that front? I would note that oftentimes, overnight liquidity of banks, etc., and their portfolios are dependent on central banks. Look at transaction systems, look at requirements of things like liquidity thresholds, which we do to target inflation, etc. So bank policy is influenced by central bank policy. Why is this then good for the environment and good for the economy? Let's talk about why green businesses develop crucially but also quicker under ours at the house. The most obvious thing is panel that we get more capital funneled and more capital funneled quickly into this industry. I will take closing if there is anything, if there's nothing, I'll take opening.\n\n> POI: Yeah, so given that climate change is caused not by our practices but by our consumption, why is growing the market to create more consumption something that's going to address this?\n\nWell, this is very weird because if you consume greener goods and you don't fuck over the environment, that's your case, then go for it. Okay. In terms of more capital being available, I want to note that oftentimes these companies produce stuff which is more expensive than other stuff produced by the state companies that are dependent on fossil fuels because those sorts of mechanisms are cheaper, right? You've already built systems which allow you to transport oil and gas cheaply and you produce lots of stuff deeply. So we allow them to achieve things like economies of scale, but also give them the environment to develop and so on. So that's the first thing. More capital is being funneled in. You get cheaper goods as a result of this, which means that people are likely to buy this sort of stuff and we give ourselves a competitive advantage. The second I want to note is a signaling effect of central bank policy, which is to suggest there oftentimes green investment happens like in competition with other kinds of investment, right? Like notice what our equity funds or people who are investing in the stock market or personal private investors likely to do at the point which they know that a green company is the one that's likely to get the money and other companies are likely to be deprioritized. I think the signaling effect of this is you signal to markets like this is what you want to invest in in the future. So you get even more capital on our side of the house and more capital is going to be beneficial because the impact we'll talk about later. The third thing I want to note is oftentimes you also have a pace of change of industries, right? Like of industries that are already dependent on pollutants. Lots of companies want to shift to environmentally friendly methods. But unfortunately, there's an economic incentive for them to not do so quickly. And especially given that there are huge costs of transactions that these companies need to undertake. I would note that oftentimes these companies are controlled by stakeholders who decide who sits on the board of directors and so on and so forth. When stakeholders are likely to then see a shift in the market, they're also likely to pressure changes in how these companies operate and how these companies use fossil fuels, etc. For instance, this increases the incentive for existing companies in the market to become greener and therefore makes our environmental impact bigger. The fifth thing I want to note is oftentimes this creates jobs, which is to suggest that when you invest in green technology because it's a new industry and also requires a lot of labor for things like building wind farms or building solar farms or whatever. This requires a lot of people to be employed in the sector. I want to note the second thing over here, which is also the fact that oftentimes these places are located outside of city centers. Environmental investment doesn't only happen within city centers, which is good because now we give employment to people who do not have access to employment usually under their side of the house and this also benefits developing countries, for instance, which we see lots of capital side because environmental dangers going up. Why is this something that is the most important thing in the round? The first thing is suggesting the environment affects everyone and affects the lives of everyone so long-term sustainability. Secondly, I want to talk about future generations which are also going to be affected by the stuff that we do. The third thing I will note is that the environment also affects the economy. So if they want to protect inflation and jobs in the future, then they must also care about this panel. The world is dying. We need to do something with you to protect it. This is the only way. We're very proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "Panel, counterintuitively, why is this debate not actually about climate change? Note that it says that we are going to get greener tech. We are going to reduce our carbon footprint, but the technology that is required for us to reduce the carbon footprint when engaging in production to zero is probably something that we do not possess yet. This is to say that if Opening Government's claim is that we are able to tackle climate change by providing incentives to produce things in a greener way, ultimately, this is something that doesn't matter if the incentives that are provided means that you are able to produce more, but just add a less damaging thing to the environment. Because if you produce a thing more times that causes a smaller damage, it is likely that it is not going to be that different from producing less things with a higher amount of damage. Therefore, meaning that insofar as you cannot possibly reduce the amount of damage you are causing to the environment to an extent, it requires you to be making no damage to the environment because note that all production has some sort of trade-off with the environment. When you incentivize these aspects of the industries to engage in massive amounts of growth, specifically, you do not access the benefits to Opening Government. Why else is this debate not then about climate change? Because the burden that Opening Government try and push on us is to say that governments are going to be really bad actors to invest in green tech. I just think that clearly the actors that are going to be investing in green technology are not governments, but it is probably private actors for a variety of reasons. Firstly, I think there's a huge amount of growth potential within climate change research technology, whereby if you are the person who is able to track these things, you are going to get massive amounts of returns by being able to speculate off it. Secondarily, the costs to enter this industry have become substantially lowered because of repeated eras of government subsidization. Thirdly, recognize that there is economies of agglomeration that they are able to utilize in order to engage in climate change research technology, whereby now that the market has been breaking into to some extent, corporations are able to determine what other corporations have messed up on, find niches, and then be able to develop things that are capable of addressing this problem. Fourthly, often climate change technology is a vanity project to these Elon Musk types, whereby not only do they have a profit incentive to be able to be the one who developed something revolutionary for it, but they also want to be the one who becomes Billy Big Bollocks and is able to access not only the market capture that is brought by it, but also the sense of prestige for addressing this. What this therefore then means for Reopening Government's case is that one and so far as they have failed to prove why this growth is something that is actually good because I will address this later, given that it is directly contradictory with their incentives about trying to reduce climate change, and given that we are capable of proving there is still a substantial amount of research and development into climate change that happens on our side, they do not activate the benefits of our case. What are we going to tell you then? Quite simply, the framing you need to take in this debate per Opening Government's own case is that there are industries right now that are reliant on the utilization of fossil fuels. Opening Government say they want to diversify away, but they can't. This is correct. And now that central banks are no longer going to be giving favorable rates to the non-central banks that would otherwise be putting capital into these businesses, these businesses get messed over and you create a vast swathe of job losses and industries that are unable to diversify their practices yet. This is what Opening Opposition are going to win on. Before I get onto that, CG.\n\n> POI: Even if I accept your analysis that private actors are the best capable actors to pursue innovation, surely it's a good thing that we expedite this process. The other central bank...\n\nNo, it's not a good thing for the analysis I'm going to give you because one, there is a trade-off when central banks do things, but there isn't a trade-off for private actors. Meaning that there is a trade-off in terms of the non-climate change clash in this debate. But the climate change clash doesn't have a trade-off because that's going to be addressed by private actors. What then is the trade-off that I'm referring to? Framing specifically, then what it looks like: central banks, in the way in which they are going to mechanize this by trying to target specific corporations and change their practices through market efficiency, they are likely going to offer favorable rates to other banks who would otherwise be lending to these industries. And they are going to change their incentive structure to make it preferable for them. What this probably looks like is things like giving them preferential interest rates or lower capital reserve requirements if they start funneling their money into green tech industries instead. The reason then why there is a substantial trade-off in the amount of investments that these banks can do is that ultimately they have to make way off about what their portfolio was going to look like and where their investment is going. Meaning that when they realize that the investments that they would otherwise be putting into industries that are required to pollute are not going to make substantial enough returns for them. Immediately, this aspect of our portfolio is going to be withdrawn and diverted to green tech industries. Nova opening government might claim this as a benefit, but I want to make three observations. One, if they claim that this is going to be the tipping point for polluting industries to diversify, it is unclear how they are going to be capable to do so without the initial capital to offset this. Secondarily, I'm proving that we are still able to access the benefits in terms of investment in green tech, meaning that we don't have to take the trade-off that they are trying to impose upon us. But thirdly, and I think this is very important: the problem is the specific context, either in manufacturing hubs in the developed world or in specific industries in the developing world that are relying on the utilization of products like plastics. This immediately fucks them over when they are unable to access capital as a consequence of this motion. And they immediately have to weather a massive short-term shock. Why are they invested in the status quo? One, they have a competitive advantage whereby they are able to utilize things that have low production costs and have great degrees of output, meaning that they are able to use the benefits of fossil fuels to their advantage. Secondarily, they are perceived to be stable investments because of the consistent production output that they have. Thirdly, specific contexts like industries that are emerging in the developing world are useful to have in portfolios because of the massive amounts of speculative potential for them eventually to provide you great degrees of profit returns. Four reasons why they use fossil fuels and are unable to diversify: one, they don't have a history of research and development within these sectors who are unable to do this quickly. Secondarily, they are unable to up their offset the upfront cost, particularly in contexts like the developing world. Thirdly, often they exist in contexts whereby they are resource rich and subsequently have to use those. Fourthly, often they are primary industries which are contingent on either the production of something that is polluting or the specific extraction of it, meaning that there is no functional way that they are able to diversify. Note that we are able to get them to diversify eventually when we keep putting capital into them. But now when you cut off that source of investment specifically, this is going to be the tipping point for them, not only being unable to eventually diversify, but the mass job losses that are going to occur as a consequence of it. Forcing people to lose their jobs because they are doing practices that we've forced them into for processes like colonial extraction. You cannot trade these people off for a speculative symmetric long-term benefit. Kind of proud to oppose.\n"

                "content": "All right, um, OO cannot have the cake and eat it too. It's as simple as that. First, let's take a little out, then onwards to greener pastures. Firstly, look, you cannot claim that on one hand, you have so much investment on greener pastures, but on the other hand, you have so much money on greener pastures. You cannot claim that you have so much money on greener pastures. You cannot claim that you have so much money on greener pastures. You cannot claim that on one hand, you have so much investment already going into green technologies and all of these things that we need to do are already happening, but at the same time saying the only way you get this mass job losses you're talking about is if you push private investors into it through monetary policy like either the development of technologies that are direct market substitutes is already happening and they're gonna displace labor anyway. Or this is not happening. But then we have a time horizon issue within which this investment is not happening. And then you need to stimulate it through our mechanism and then talk about whether there's an unemployment or not. You cannot claim the unemployment harm. But at the same time say that those things are developing anyway at a pace that we needed. This might work in an infinite time horizon debate in which we have, you know all the time to switch the economy to something else. This is what we don't have. But secondly, like they note all these big companies are unable to diversify because they have don't have research and development and they cannot offset upfront costs. Like Rio Tinto has all the money to change. Shell has all the money to change. The biggest polluters are the biggest international conglomerates that have the most patents in the world on green technology, that have the biggest development centers in the world, that are the ones that are stalling this technology because it's in their benefit to do the cheaper thing now to get more money now because their interest is not social interest, it's private interest. This is why you need to incentivize their private interest to meet the social interest, like the basic market failure analysis. But let's see. We tell you, like if we're talking about the developing countries, if anything, they are the ones that are going to get fucked by the climate change the most, like they're the ones that are suffering. If anything, they're also the ones that are the first one to implement green technology, like anti-flooding mechanisms in India, Bangladesh, and flooding systems. Like they're the ones that are actually implementing those things. Existence of these technologies directly improves the overall welfare of those countries and is likely to lead to less instability there. Overall, like economy isn't only about employment. It is about overall stability of availability goods and services. This is how we take out OO. Okay, let's talk about how our mechanism achieves the shift productively. What they're saying is, \"Oh, you know, the problem is that those big companies will not diversify if you push them into it.\" Like one, I'm still not sure why they diversify on there. Like what was the incentive of Rio Tinto to change, like ever or at least in time? To produce something effective. So let me explain how this happens on our side. Look, big private companies are oftentimes incredibly credited on their other side because they exist on the over the idea of leverage. So the idea is I borrow something, I make a lot more, and the difference is the one that I'm taking home. What does this mean? This means that Rio Tinto every now and then comes to Goldman Sachs and says, \"Look, I want to turn over my revolver credit. I want to, you know, take another loan to execute a merger.\" All of those things happen on daily basis. This is what central bankers do. What this means is that know that central bank changes its policy when they come back suddenly. The rate at which they're doing this revolver credit has like doubled. It suddenly not does not make sense for them anymore to produce things in the way they do to leverage themselves in the way they do because it is too costly. No, this is explicitly going on private interest of shareholders. This is decreasing their profit margins. This makes them their skin in the game not worth it anymore. This is why you're likely to get changes there because this is their basic business model is leveraging themselves and getting profit out of it. You're tackling this directly by instituting new rules. But don't you say, \"Oh, but they might go to another bank.\" No, no, no. Client relationships when it comes to private investment banking are one of the most important things because you know their company and you have a long-term established relationship. Even if you go to another bank then it is the same still the same regulation that you're dealing with like in the same way. As you know cannot take out crazy credits. This is just another regulation that's added on top. But secondly, let's talk about where the most money in the world is currently. Look, the most biggest investors are private equity funds. They're the biggest vehicles of liquidity in the world. How do they invest? Mostly they're comprised of older citizens that have a lot of money and like things that they have known before. Rio Tinto is a great example of something they like investing in because they know it. But they also like stability of central bank on the other side. What this means is as central banks have started pushing this more aggressively like through the past 10 years, by the way. But then now when you make a legislation that explicitly says from now until internally. Internally, is it a central bank goal to support this kind of businesses? This effectively raises the price of these assets but also collateralizes them because central bank has that is standing behind them with their mandate. This is the kind of investment that private equity funds are likely to find sexy. But even more pension funds are likely to find sexy because this is makes them stable and this is how you get money funneled funneled in here. No, this is an exclusive mechanism in which you don't engage in a government trade-off. They say, \"Oh, monetary. No, there's no trade. There's no trade-off in private investment. No, they're supporting private investment that is subsidized by subsidies. Subsidies do possess a trade-off between social versus systems in governments or giving subsidies to green technology. This plan does not involve this kind of trade-off. The trade-off is literally taking money away from companies like Rio Tinto because there are these are the advantages for investors. And putting them into, into, other into other companies you do not engage with social welfare. But you change private investor incentives and this is how you get accelerated change at this point. Uh opening.\n\n> POI: Yeah, so corporate practices are cultivated by the fact that they have to meet the demands of our consumers, given that those demands are going to be static. How do you think their practices are ever going to change?\n\nRight, I mean, I don't know what your answer is on your side to this. What we say is, given the demands are there, we need to incentivize the development of technologies, the implementation of technologies that, by the way, already exist through this mechanism so that private interest matches social interest. At the point where the consumer of electricity at the end does not care in which way it's produced. This is why you can switch Rio Tinto from something that's polluting to something that is not. But also, lastly, some preemption if, like, closing comes in and talks about information and talks about inflation and says, \"Oh, this is going to go out of proportion.\" One, we're telling you that this kind of investment changes have happened in the past and in the same way as stability was implemented as a crucial goal for central banks in the past. This is how you're able to guide your investors, too. Secondly, those investors are expert investors that know what happens in an economy, especially if central bank says, \"Look, we are just shifting actual asset purchasing programs from one asset to another.\" This is unlikely to produce a massive change because they're expert investors. This does likely do not change expectations within the market. But also, lastly, inflation is problematic at the point when you have a lot of unemployment because this squeezes the consumer at the point when these kind of investments are likely to employ a lot of people and not employ them over a long time sustainably. Even a slightly higher inflation, which we like, I honestly don't think it happens, uh, is likely a trade-off that we are happy to take. For all those reasons, opening government.\n"

                "content": "Panel, the reason why certain states are so reliant on fossil fuels in order for their economy to function is not because of any reason more insidious than a flat reliance that has been established through necessity or established through a history or legacy of colonialism that has removed their ability to economically develop. Let's be really clear. Then we accept that this motion does accomplish a lower volume of investment, including industries. We don't really care if this pivot is gradual or rapid, but the nature of speculative investment is always going to be forward-thinking, meaning that this pivot is likely to occur quickly regardless of how staggered the implementation of this policy is. You aren't going to sink one million dollars into mining infrastructure in a developing nation if you know that in 10 years nobody will value your asset much and there's no capital for growth potential or expansion of your existing asset. I want to do some direct rebuttal then before I move on to rebuilding some of Jason's case. I think this clearly isn't just the big polluters, particularly given the industries more reliant on investment from banks or those which are emerging. Big polluters also don't change much here because the problem is their massive amount of production output. There's no way you can entirely reduce their pollution when they have such a substantial demand to meet. And corporate practices don't really change when you're not able to change the consumption patterns of people. Specifically then, I think what this pivot more looks like is industries that have bad environmental effects but aren't specifically like fuel industries, probably like manufacturing or something. Specifically then, developing countries most fucked over by climate change is exactly why they need access to investment to be able to offset the initial cost of diversification in order to be able to develop their economy so that this is actually practical. Let's be really clear on the comparative then. Here, green tech investments are already incredibly fucking attractive in the status quo. Why is this? Number one, massive growth potential because using them is an eventuality, right? Two, production costs are sinking rapidly currently due to massive R&D investment driving down costs and increasing productivity. Three, massive government investment already into R&D means that corporations get to piggyback off investments that the government made and they don't have to sink these costs themselves for the inevitability of the global economy being entirely reliant on green tech in the future because we have finite fossil fuel reserves. Corporations want to get in early specifically because investing now to get this first mover or second mover advantage within a state or specific field of renewable energy is very valuable. And five, vanity projects, all the reason which is the reason Jason told you for a good PR. Therefore, no fucking green tech startup corporations in the status quo with positive potential in whatever tech that aren't already being showered in R&D capital and infrastructure capital exist. Specifically then, if the delta in investment in green tech is not significant, what does change here? Banks become averse to investment in high-polluting sectors, with the comparative being investment in more neutral industries. They aren't being punished for investing in, they aren't necessarily green, just neutral like tech industries, software, pharma, bread and butter stable industries that they're replacing investments that likely had a low but stable and consistent return, i.e. steel manufacturing or something like this. This is true because lean portfolios have a neat spectrum of risk to ensure return. So if you're replacing something that was previously quite stable, you're also going to want quite a stable investment, something that's not speculative. And so this is why we're not getting this huge amount of innovation or something and the pivot has to happen because the return yield was already low as these in these industries because they had like the stable risk and low profit margins generally. Why then are developing nations so reliant on high-polluting industries? And why is this so unlikely to change? All the recent Jason tells you about primary sector reliance and being often quite resource-rich in terms of natural resources, but also because necessarily they have necessary lowering of environmental regulations in order to possess a comparative advantage in things like manufacturing. Panel, nickel is not mined in Indonesia because it is a rare mineral and there aren't reserves elsewhere. It's mined there because the government has provided the incentive of loosening environmental restrictions to attract corporations that want to mine this mineral. I think you can probably say the exact same for manufacturing and heavy industry. You can say the same for agricultural processes like how silage covering in India is just not very strict, which means they're able to be a huge food. They're able to have a lot of investment in their agricultural sector. These states are specifically reliant on not cracking down in order to ensure a comparative advantage for corporations and to secure future foreign investment in future industrialization and urbanization of their nations. Government then specifically have to stand over a rapid pivot away leading to the pull out of individual corporations and existing corporations and potential expansion of existing industries. Before I move on, I'll take the POI from closing.\n\n> POI: As per your analysis, can you name me one hedge fund or institutional investor who will put in a sizable amount of money? Do these ESG companies have only massive speculative potential that can be actualized in the next 10 years?\n\nSorry, I'm sorry. I don't think I really understand this POI. You're saying hedge funds won't invest in these speculative industries. These industries, like manufacturing stuff, aren't speculative. They're probably replacing their investment in these industries with something that's pretty stable because generally these are like low interest, low return industries. Like manufacturing, steel production, agriculture, that kind of stuff. What then this probably looks like is a rapid pivot away, specifically from these industries and towards other neutral industries like pharma or something. Or like medtech stuff that doesn't really change all that much, but not really an investment in green tech. For all the reasons we've already told you, I think what this rapid pivot away probably initially looks like is just people losing their fucking jobs. This is specifically important because people in developing countries that, oh, do you want to talk about? Won't fucking live to see the floods or the natural disasters that they talk about if the economy collapses and people starve to death. Number two, removal of all ability to accelerate your own economic development. Specifically, a lot of what this looks like because these countries don't have a lot of native investment or native capital reserves. It looks like a removal of the incentive to invest in foreign industry altogether, specifically. What there's no because there's no alternative targets for fdi within these countries themselves other than these high polluting industries. What this looks like is people just investing more in domestic industries as a comparative. The comparative then means that you're you don't get in these nations, you don't get all of these massive growth and jobs outside of primary sector activities. Which means more people end up doing things like subsistence farming. They have less food security. They have less access to infrastructure and less access to services like medicine. You also get a lack of ancillary industries that typically open up in these nations as a result of industrialization. This looks like you make a factory and now you have to have like accountants and stuff to manage the activities of that factory. I think you also aren't able to establish infrastructure that can be used for other purposes. You get this like big manufacturing hub and you're able to get like better water. Better investment in like sanitation and stuff because specifically the factory needs water supply or something like this. And I think what this also looks like is having no future potential for economic growth generally because specifically developing countries are really reliant on fdi in order to get any kind of economic development whatsoever. I think what this looks like is less countries being industrialized. But I also think this looks like less potential for being more environmentally friendly within these nations because it costs so much to invest in renewable technology and they will have to do it eventually. But they're not going to be able to afford it if they weren't able to get any native industries to develop in the first place. And they don't didn't get any of the ancillary jobs. I think for all of these reasons, opening governments screwing over the developing world and they haven't really offered us any alternative for how they're going to ameliorate this. For all of these reasons, proud to oppose.\n"

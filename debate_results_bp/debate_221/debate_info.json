                "content": "For a long time, the suppression of the self has been the foremost concern of humanity and their ability to be happy. We think religions that emphasize the self as something inalienable and something that ought to be preserved is something that will make people on the whole happier and exhibit more of the characteristics of centering the self are better than those that exhibit less of the characteristics that center the self and reject the self. What are these characteristics we think are very good? One, recognizing that there is a diversity of human experience that emphasizes all these experiences are valuable and essential. The soul, the feather-spun person beneath the flinch is the source of your divinity and that makes you unique and valuable. Two, the self and the existence of that self is positive and life is positive. That is, the existence of your individual experiences as unique is good and not temporary or unhappy. And number three is that the primacy of the self and the choices of the self we know today are good and are actual versus some greater obligation to an afterlife or to a God that requires self-sacrifice or the sublimation into a greater whole. These are the characteristics we think are good for the debate and more importantly what will be debated on. So number one, agency. First, I will do the counterfactual which is I will prove on our side we have much more of a diversity of experience and a respect for the agency of people. On our side, the conception of the self where the difference of human experience is special and valued is much more likely to lead to the acceptance of individuals who belong to sexual minorities excluded within the church for women who have the rights restrained within religion simply for the mistake of being born a woman. We think that the ability to equalize experience is much more likely to cause significantly greater acceptance for these individuals for three reasons. One, their differences are now highlighted as similarly a path to divinity and as a connection to God rather than one that is unholy and strays away from the pack. Two, it is more likely that people accept differences rather than curse it as a means of betraying the community, the leader and God, which is more likely an op because you are told that you have to reject yourself for some greater purpose and hence being more individual leads the community away from group solace. And three is that they are also more likely to find individuality as a way to interpret and practice religion on gov. So they see that individuality as something to cherish and as something that can be meaningful in allowing them to better experience their relationship with God. So this is personally preferable. It is important because getting more than just community acceptance, they are also likely to get personal acceptance of themselves and who they are, which is incredibly difficult and incredibly important internal harm to make sure that people are comfortable in their own skin and in their own lives. This is incredibly important since whatever benefits of religion op argues is incredibly inaccessible, if not actively dangerous to the people who need it the most. What does it look like on opposition bench? We think opposition leads to key repressions of agency. We think religion can typically be a highly oppressive structure a lot of the time and balance and the greater structure of it can be difficult. If the source of value on our side is unique human experience, as we say, it is more likely that religion values doctrines that maximize the choice of people because they are primary individuals rather than the imposition of authority to introduce order. On their side, one, differences are seen as a source of unhappiness and authority will take it upon themselves to do what is best for people to suppress this. Two, absent the ability to connect God from the self, it is not necessarily that you get it from meditating, but op will likely seek it out from other higher powers, which means that they are substantially more vulnerable to politicization, they are substantially more vulnerable to a single individual controlling the reins and using it for their own gain. So in instances where religion is coercive, you get three harms on op. One, certain minority groups on the color of their skin are more willing to be suppressed or experience suppression more because you view their individuality as an affront to God and something that should be expunged. Two, you defer a lot of authority rather than democratization on the ground, which makes it vulnerable to cooptation and politicization. This means that these religions are more likely to be used in the aid of authoritarian governments, they're more likely to be used to suppress people in the name of power. And number three is that you all experience internal suppression, which is super vicious and suffering. That some people will be individual and unique no matter what, but they feel that this part of themselves is something that is broken, something that is flawed because it makes them want to cherish themselves, but this goes against every belief that they have. They are born with preferences, they will be very different somehow. Everyone has something that makes them different from someone else. That means every person in the world that can experience some level of suffering and some level of despair because they can ever truly reject the part of themselves that they are born with and have no control over. Why should you weigh this argument massively? One, because it talks about vulnerable groups who have very little opportunity to fight back, who are most likely to put in positions of deep disprivilege and need the solace the most, but are at the same time removed from the solace. Number two, it has the potential to throw societies in upheaval and conflict because religions and op are most likely to descend into violence and suffering because they are vulnerable to a large leader who's comfortable in suppressing the individuality of people, leading to large-scale conflict and politicization. And number three is that this tyranny over the self cannot ever be mitigated because it is coming from you, something an external body does not have the similar amount of harm. You yourself are the one that experienced causing this massive physical harm and mental harm unto yourself and will go with you for the rest of your life. This is why we think a world on opposition is a world not worth defending. Second argument though, we think it is also easier to convince communities to come together and help the most vulnerable, help the poorest in the world. Our counterfactual being centered on the self doesn't mean that op is centered on other people. Indeed, we actually reject that and say our side makes people better for other individuals. Three reasons why. Number one, if human suffering is unimportant and is temporary, it is much easier to justify deprioritizing the wellbeing of other individuals in the name of justifying their spiritual happiness, despite the fact that they are suffering on the ground. Two, especially when your individual life is an illusion that causes unhappiness and your struggles are unimportant, it is easy to sideline their issues by calling it a necessary part of human life. So not just saying that it doesn't matter, but that it's obligatory that they suffer. And three, assuming the desire to do good was the same on both sides, which we categorically deny from the first two premises, the manner in which you do good is also worse, right? There are more likely to support interventions that impose on people. So, two, kitchens that alleviate some suffering now, but keep people locked barely above subsistence instead of consulting people for what they actually need, like building schools, building roads, building hospitals, based on the real lived experiences. I'll give the fourth mech after I take the away from CO.\n\n> POI: The action of the self means that you believe that differences are incidental. When you center the self, it means you value those differences being something that is fundamentally part of your human experience.\n\nAnd yet, since these differences are incidental, they must be removed. They're clearly unimportant to people. They're clearly unimportant to you and can be removed. So even if they are incidental, that makes things even worse, as opposed to something that should be expunged from people. Fourth mechanism. It's easier to relate to others because even if experiences are unique, you can find some broad themes and acknowledge that they have a self that is just as dignified as yours. Whereas if on the up, people are all the same and there's no underneath the person, right? There's no nothing underneath the soul that gives them that uniqueness, then it is not sufficient to see them as worthy of dignity. Hence, why is this really, really important? Number one, religion is the largest charity in the world and the largest outpouring of aid that humanity has really ever seen. So we're just like losing out on a gigantic amount of aid, gigantic amount of resources to uplift people out of poverty, particularly because of the structural reasons saying that the suffering is indeed necessary and important to keep in place. Number two, they're also most likely to target areas of poverty where no one goes that have very few people to support them because they still see these people as worthy of uplifting in order to unlock their choices and make individuality available to them. But number three, I also wanna point out that it's not just physical spirituality, but physical health, but also spiritual health that allows people to experience solace and happiness in ways that they could not, especially in particularly oppressive places or places where they feel the most amount of suffering. At the end of this speech, unambiguously, categorically, the center of the self is precisely why government is the center of this debate. Affirm.\n"

                "content": "We believe that the framing and characterization of how this narrative works in OG is a bit convenient. The first thing I'd like to posit is, this narrative is independent of other narratives that operate in the world. For example, there are lots of other narratives that operate, that promote a sense of self. Things like capitalism, things like other reasons, like basic biological needs, where you want to earn more money to live a better life. All of this exists devoid of religious influence. What is the reason for this influence? Because this is dependent on drive power, i.e. maximizing your ability to control resources, maximizing the output that a society generates in order to create lived experiences for those who've captured power early. This debate then happens in a world in which these natural drives for self-preservation and importance already exist, but counterbalances that with religion that says maybe this narrative is not important. So the first thing I'd like to posit is, having multiple narratives is in and of itself a win. The first reason for this is because different people end up having different degrees of success in life by virtue of a plethora of reasons that I'll get to in my second extension. But I think this is intuitive enough. Some people are born rich, some people win worlds, some people don't end up in semis. What the point of this is, is that when you get individualized success, you can still get happiness by subscribing to particular amounts of narratives that exist in the world that tell you that individualized success is important versus some people who don't end up winning the capitalistic zero-sum game and fall at the bottom, can subscribe to religion and therefore get contentment out of this. If you look at the world empirically, the richer you are in a lot of cases means you're more educated and you've opted out of religion to begin with. That's a good thing because that allows you to subscribe to that form of happiness. So the first and most fundamental attack to OG is, this is a narrative that challenges existing narratives, that maximizes accessibility of narratives to a greater number of people, and therefore distributes the quality of life more equally. Let's say this is not true. The rest of this case will assume that this is not true, even though this is good enough to beat their case and why the alternative narrative is good enough to begin with. The biggest case they say is, we need to maximize agency by accepting women and minorities within, but understanding differences of self. Before that, I'll take CG.\n\n> POI: Well, it is true that narratives like capitalism are also individualistic. The kinds of behaviors that they privilege from individuals and the kinds of individuals that they hold up as icons are different and that has different consequences for the way we view ourselves.\n\nAnd the argument is it's beneficial to have different narratives that different people can subscribe to. It's unclear what all subscription from all people is likely to be homogenous. The first response to acceptance of different people, which is differences of self. The first thing I'd like to point out is, it is unclear why the way in which this acceptance happened is structurally explained in OG. I.e the way you ascribe, what your interpretation of yourself is, is often basis religious leaders or the way in which this religion is interpreted. The first thing I'd like to posit is, the definition of self can be prescribed. I.e you are born a man, this is yourself, and this is what the rest of your life should be. It is unclear why you are trying to change yourself. Yourself is important. So the interpretation of that can stop the most important minorities that they're trying to protect. The second is you are often blamed for the choices that contradict religion because you see it as an individualized choice that these people actively choose to make. Principles like homosexuality is bad in religion came much before these complex doctrines of self materialized in the world. So things like you choosing to be gay is seen as an attack on religion that is more likely to be flipped against you because yourself and your choices matter. The comparative is, when none of these experiences matter, you're more likely to just be like, yeah, let them fuck another guy, who cares? Because it doesn't impact the way in which they should be deemed as moral entities. But secondly, you also disempower religion to the same extent where you say that their definition of yourself matters less. The entire human experience matters less. So the ability for these religious leaders to influence you also comparatively reduces. If anything, we accept the minorities more on our side. First positive material, escapism. We believe the vast majority of the world is predetermined. There are lots of reasons for this. Number one, lottery of birth. You don't choose what kind of family you're born into. Number two, IQ. Number three, your interactions, who you interact with and your set of legal experiences often determine what your free will is in the future. Number four, even if all of this is not true, just pure randomness of the molecular atoms in your brain that influence what your ultimate choice or life will be. What this means is you often don't end up choosing the ultimate experiences that you go through in life. Why is this particularly important? Number one, this is premised on the fact that you are prioritizing all of these experiences on Gov. At a point in time when certain people are privileged and they think this privilege needs to be maximized because their set of experiences matters, there is less of an incentive to give up these kinds of privileges because you realize your individualized experiences also matter and therefore you need to maximize your connection with God. So you do things like donate a million dollars to building a mosque because that was the capacity you were born with rather than thinking it's just less important to begin with. The second is the worst case of this is a lot of people are oppressed and end up suffering. The best case of this is you just undergo randomness. So some people end up with good experiences. Some people end up with bad experiences. There are two major harms that operate out of this. Number one, you blame yourself for not doing enough to be religious. I.e. you often don't interpret the structural barriers when you think about yourself all day. We see the same problem with capitalism. It's a very simple parallel. When you think from an individualized perspective at all times, you always try to compare the next day to the previous and try to see incremental improvement at different points in time. So when you fail because of structural barriers that are beyond your control, you blame yourself for that failure rather than blaming external actors. Number two, you also are further harmed when religious actors exploit this and tell you that no matter how much you do, the uncertainty of what this relationship with God is like, which is important in God's world, means they can coerce you into continuously doing more and more every time. So the more you pray, the more they say, donate more. And you are further put into a cycle of exploitation where what you are as a self and an experience does not matter or there is no end point. Ultimately, what this means is even when you do things, like try to discover yourself, things like anti-religious choices, you just feel worse because that choice is something you subscribe into. Ultimately, this means all of these people live in existential crises because they didn't choose where they ended up in. And therefore, they also suffer by virtue of that experience. And therefore, they feel bad that the narrative they're fed to all societies is the fact that this experience matters. The comparative is on our side, very simple. Number one, you just ignore that these experiences matter. So even if you don't get the best outcomes in life, which happens through randomness, you're at least content about it. And therefore, the net unhappiness, which is prominent across the world is reduced. The second is you also prevent exploitation by religious groups on the most vulnerable. That I think is important. Lastly, and more trivially on social change. I think it's also important for majorities to realize that they themselves and their wealth capture does not matter. Okay, sorry, I didn't know my time was up. But the point is, it's just better for people to experience life, not through randomness, but and be unhappy through it, but through contentment. And we're very glad to oppose.\n"

                "debater_name": "OG",
                "content": "I first wonder about this other narratives exist argument, because this only one stance will take over Number one, I can name equally as many narratives that focus on self-sacrifice for the greater good of a community, nationalism, family, so many other things that make this balance of whatever incredibly useless. But secondly, even if you didn't think that was the case, I think especially where people have religions as their primary motivator for the ways in which they determine their behaviors and the way in which they view life, are where people are far most likely to be vulnerable. I think the question from opening opposition is how do we make it so that we don't have to I think the question from opening opposition is, they don't really explain the degree to which coercion occurs, whereas I think David was far more structural in explaining why A, if you value every single individual human experience, therefore the source of knowledge of religious freedom and happiness ought be the individual rather than some greater structure around you and imposition of the choices of that structure, because they are not a greater source of moral authority in so far as what makes you holy is your direct connection to God rather than needing some kind of mediator in the middle. But secondly is, in so far as that increase the amount of choices that you have, for people that are especially vulnerable, this has two benefits. Number one is if religion is the main motivator and influence in your life, it makes it much less likely that these figures are going to be more oppressive. Either you don't feel like they actively impose ideas upon you, or even when they do, you don't necessarily have to subscribe to them in so far as you also believe that your own struggles, beliefs and ways in which you connect to God are equally as valuable as whatever the recommendations ought be. So for the most vulnerable individuals, that's where they're more coercive. But secondly is, and this responds to their point that things like homophobia existed before these kinds of set of the self things, which this motion is not a retrospective, this could easily equally apply. But secondly is that even if homophobia was an aspect of that religion, again, it is more likely that even if the community around you believes in these kinds of things, that you feel like your own personal experiences and your own source of moral authority is sufficient in order to say that it is wrong, that your direct connection to God and your sexuality is key and core part of that, rather than saying they are correct and I must accept and internalize the degree of homophobia that exists within my religion. But thirdly, I think what they do not mention is that all these other narratives do not answer an existential question. I.e. capitalism might tell you to work hard to stay alive, but it will not tell you why you are alive. And I think that is the unique nuance of religion because it explains what is the reason for your purpose? Why are you here? Why are you on this earth? And I think the problem with opening opposition is they ignore the degree to which personal solace matters so much to the various people that they cater to, such that absent all the agency, political, donation arguments that exist within this debate, the most certain benefit here is that it is much easier for people to connect to a life in which they believe their own personal experiences that they go through every day whereas Sajid says, we are in such a deep personal reflection of why you are on this earth and maybe God put you here for a reason, et cetera, as opposed to thinking that every single day of your life on this earth is unimportant and unnecessary. And the important thing to note here about the comparative opposition is that oftentimes what they do is they connect this to some greater spiritual purpose, like an afterlife or a God that is either incredibly impersonal, especially when your own personal experiences and humanity is ignored or so far in the future that you will never get to experience it. That's incredibly important because for a lot of individuals, when their life isn't so good, when their material experiences of the people around them, as Sajid says, are not very good, oftentimes religion is the only thing that's convenient in purpose. Firstly is even in bad experiences, oftentimes it is religion that gives a sense that you were not left behind, that there's purpose to everything that you go through. Like when you have a family member that is sick and gets better, you feel that maybe God had intervened in that manner because God values your own individual and personal experiences as well as the fact you can interpret and reflect on those experiences in a manner that makes your struggles and connections divine, which is much more likely you feel that your religion has an everyday purpose in your life, rather than some arbitrary and abstract purpose in all honesty, as yet to be defined when opening up as a struggle. So that's incredibly important precisely because I think it is the most accessible benefit in this debate, absent of all the other environmental factors that might exist as a consequence. But the second thing to note here is, I think David argues quite concretely, why is it we get people to rally together in such that we think human experience is valuable, that human struggle is like, and we should remove human struggle and ensure that they are recognized as important and as valuable, and that you can connect to other people, you're more likely to get donations, but also reflect the kinds of agency that they experience. The important thing about this is that in so far as opening up this case relies on an incredibly worst case scenario of you fail, you don't do well, you don't have a good material life. Not only do we expand the number of people who no longer fall under that category, because more and more of them are being taken out of poverty and given the means to do so. And so far, I think it reflects their choice on what they actually need in their life. But moreover, I think this is the most material benefit we can accrue in this debate, versus all the other arguments coming from opening opposition, I don't think are nearly as important. I'll take the POI from CO.\n\n> POI: Yeah, a higher purpose is often couched in the material world through obvious virtues and valuable things, such as giving to charity or constantly engaging in charitable action. We probably get more material benefit to those in need on our side of the house.\n\nSo my question is, why do you think that solving human struggle is valuable if it's unimportant and humanity is unhappy anyway? If not, rather than trying to strive for some greater other purpose, then again, as yet to be outlined in opposition bench, and notably, you need to believe that the diversity of human experience is a valuable thing to begin with in order to attain that kind of benefit. So it's unclear to me why that benefit falls on your side of the house. Last thing I wanna do is like respond to the PR coming from opposing opposition, because they say that differences, instead of being valued and special, are instead incidental. There are a couple of reasons why that is worse. Firstly, these differences will oftentimes lead to worse quality of lives for people when they are discriminated on the basis of these differences. In so far as we believe that these are incidental, unimportant, it is much easier to attribute the fact that it is maybe their own fault because these differences don't matter, or the fact that we're ignoring a lot of the very real and genuine struggles that they have had in order to ensure that they get little to no reparation in the future. That's important for a couple of reasons. Firstly, both in terms of how we react to these differences, it is much easier to make up for and ensure a greater amount of accommodation. In so far as you recognize that these differences exist, that they matter, and they do not try to obfuscate everything in some vague sense of equality, and therefore, if everything is all right. But secondly, is it particularly for these individuals, when they recognize that part of the divine process is some kind of struggle, that these struggles are important and valued experiences, rather than things that everybody goes through equally, that even if they have lived harder lives, they still are going to be seen as equally as other individuals, that instead is celebrated as a divine and holy purpose in their path to salvation, is much better and gives more likely comfort and solace to these individuals. So to the degree to which we're able to both materially provide for them, and at the same time, give them some sense of comfort, it is when you recognize that these differences exist, that diversity matters, not when you say these differences are incidental and not meaningful in whatsoever form. I'm very proud to propose.\n"

                "debater_name": "OO",
                "content": "The biggest assumption on opening government is that because you have a religion that centers on the self, somehow magically all unique experiences are going to individualize to the extent to which religion becomes all inclusive and caters to everyone. We tell you that this is A, a massive assumption and B, massively convenient. I'll explain structurally why. Because what you need to realize is this obviously operates in a world that exists today, which is to say that vast majority of religions came about in either before Christ or after Christ in the sixth centuries, first century and along those timelines. In those timelines, it was necessary for religion to do two things. Number one, establish social order to a set of principles that were then endemic to their time. And number two, it was also important in order for a lot of people to capture power and rule over particular groups of people and so on and so forth. Which means that the hierarchical structure that religion has and generally operates under is important in both sides of the world structurally because of the way in which religion operates. Now, the question is, how is it then relevant for the center of the self experiences and so on and so forth? In center of the self experiences, you have choices, experiences, struggles and connections to God from an individual perspective that are important, right? But nobody necessarily is essentially born an expert of religion, which means that generally speaking, when it comes to like seeking religious help, seeking religious advice, you still go to people for religious, so priests, mullahs and so on and so forth, who are on top of religious hierarchies and so on and so forth. But what is unique to this particular experience of choices and so on and so forth is that you value these choices to utmost importance using religion as the litmus paper to judge all of these choices. What do I essentially mean by this? If you are then an individual who wants to choose to be an alternative sexuality, you ask yourself, would religion allow this? And the answer to that is no, religion wouldn't allow this because religion subscribes something else. In order to establish your connection to God, you need to be of a particular sexuality for that connection to be established. For opening government's argument to come into play here, they have to advocate for the non-existence of all forms of religious scriptures that came about in the world in one way or the other, which we think is quite impossible in this particular instance. What is then the comparative on our side? The comparative on our side is individual choices do not matter as much. What does this mean? This means that your spiritual connection to God generally and the fact that you have an afterlife and so on and so forth are things that matter more generally. Why is this that important in those particular cases? Because your ability to judge someone else for their individual choices goes down the point at which you do not think individual choices matter as much as you think it is. But yes, under our side, yes, you still think it is possibly a sin and it is something that is an aberration from religion. Yes, but you do not put as much importance to this as much as you do in government's world. Why is this then bad in terms of impacts? Because it opens a pathway for exploitation to a large extent, not just from rulers, but priests and so on and so forth. How does this happen? This happens in two ways uniquely. Number one, because priests and so on and so forth, because hierarchies emerge naturally within the human existence anyways, they also prioritize their own individual connection to God. So I, as a priest in a particular community, also prioritize the fact that I need to maximize my relationship with God to the fullest extent. In order to do that, what I will do is make sure that my congregation, my followers are also following religion to the particular letter in that particular instance, rather than in a comparative under our world where you reject the self and your own connection to God is not as important, but rather a general wellbeing of individuals is more important because life now matters less more generally. In those particular instances, you open up a doorway of exploitation. So exploitation that opening government claims under their side actually happens worse under their side because then they can say, ah, but given that all of your individual choices matter and all of these things matter so much, you need to follow my word and you need to follow my word in a way such that it is important for, like it is important for you to then maximize your happiness under religion. And that's quite important in this particular case, right? Because then you allow... But secondly, generally speaking, your ability and the way in which you see others changes, and that is particularly important. Why do I say this? If individual choices are important, individual agency is important and so on and so forth, you see as a Christian, I'm making Christian choices. And that is very important because my individual connection to God is very, very important. In those cases, you judge anyone who is not making those Christian choices because these are of utmost priority to you. You believe that making Christian choices in this world is the most important thing for you and for everyone within your congregation, which opens up a pathway for, A, otherization of different individuals who are like generally minority religions, but B, otherization of individuals, even within your family. So if you think your son or daughter is probably becoming someone of alternative sexuality, then you start suppressing them and that's horrible. Before I move on, I'll take one from closing opening.\n\n> POI: So even if hierarchy is bad in the abstract sense, what you've yet to prove is that given that hierarchies do exist in either world, why if I'm doing what the hierarchy tells me and that makes me a happier person, why that's an intrinsically bad thing?\n\nOkay, that's an intrinsically bad thing mostly because we have accepted generally within this debate that religion is, it generally gives you certain horrible ideas because of the way in which structural religions have come about. So for example, vast majority of major religions in the world, 6 to 6.5 billion people, maybe even more than that exist within religions that came before 6th century and before, which means that that is quite horrible in general in this particular instance. That is why it's important for you to reject the self and the hierarchical teachings coming in are not as important, which means that in a way, because you're rejecting the self and because you're rejecting that this life is something that is way too important, you're able to then abstractly find happiness in other sources. And this is where Sajid's argument becomes very important. In a capitalistic world where you don't have a lot of control over a lot of things, and this is not just restricted to material wealth, this is also restricted to things like religiosity. Vast majority of us, if we look at it from a religious lens, even religious people commit a lot of acts of sin throughout their lives. In those circumstances, if they then come to assess their life as to, oh, what about my individual connection to God? You end up in a self-deprecating state where because you did not have enough money, you did not have enough time to pray. Because you did not have enough money, you did not have enough ability to contribute to religious charities, religious beliefs, and so on and so forth. That's why you go into a self-deprecation mode because people who have power always have captured more important places by the end of things like contributions, by the end of things like capturing positions of priesthood and so on and so forth. In those circumstances, a rejection of self uniquely allows you to then tell yourself that, look, I have made sins in my life. I may not have been as rich or even middle-class to a certain extent, but because this life is not as important, I can prioritize something else and I can get happiness from something else. This is uniquely important in this particular instance because things like nationalism and other collectivistic identities do not uniquely allow you to access happiness from these things. Because even things like nationalism and so on and so forth are tied to some form of collective material goals, such as economic growth and stuff like that. This is a unique form of identity that allows you to abstract yourself, put yourself away from the material life that you have, and then get happiness from outside. And that happiness is the true form of happiness that you can get. Under our world, you have less religious exploitation, and under our world, you have happier individuals. Incredibly proud to oppose.\n"

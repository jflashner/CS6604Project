                "content": "The world's reliance on the dollar is unquestionably a bad thing. It has exposed the global economy to systemic risk time and time again. And moreover, has made it hard for countries to employ policies that are needed for crisis response for the individual economies that will have different requirements from the dollar. In this speech. First, we will do some setup. So the dollar currently manifest its global reliance in three ways. One, it is the main currency of international reserve. It is a store of value by which you use to shore up your government's income. And generally, it's also used primarily for international transactions. It's also secondly, the main currency of lending. And thirdly, is that a very large amount of countries have either accepted it as their currency directly or peg their currency to the dollar in some form. We want to highlight that as an historical note, this is not a consensual activity for many of the poorest of the poor whom we made poor. This was a requirement for Bretton Woods Institutes in order for you and for them to provide you loans in order to lift you out of poverty. This is a dramatic decline in autonomy for currency in the global economy. What will it be replaced by? We think there are a variety of plausible options individual nation central banks will use to determine the value of their own currency. We think they will likely peg it to a variety of other things when they need strength or leave it floating if they feel comfortable in its stability. It's possible that they peg it to a basket of other currencies, potentially the RMB, the yen, the pound, the euro, or they peg it to a commodity that is vital to their industry like gold. We don't have to explain only one, but that it is far better to have the plausibility or the optionality of other options. Why is this likely to manifest in this way where countries have choice and not where they're forced to pick one other option? This is because the decline currently manifests as the current global tightening cycle pushing for countries to replace their reserves gradually because the fact that obviously it's introducing massive amounts of risk to their own country and price stability is in shambles for most countries around the world. So essentially the current global tightening cycle is something the countries want to opt out of or try and avoid and they will try and slowly replace their international reserves with a variety of options and this also aligns with existing efforts of broader international push for a long time to substitute the dollar or augment it with other countries' currencies like the IMF special drawing rights, for example. We think these other options will be expanded in order to allow countries to have it. So we just think this is likely because it's obviously best, it's safest and safest for these countries and just their existing efforts that we think they can capitalize on already. Two arguments in this speech. First of all, systemic risk. How is systemic risk introduced by a global reliance in the dollar? The US is one of the most deregulated financial sectors in the world, exposed to significant lobbying from large groups since the Reagan era to consistently expose it to financial shock in the 90s, in the 2000s, all the way to now. Countries, specifically the central bank in the US, has to cater to these institutions as particularly the revolving door in the Federal Reserve where they go back into industry and benefit off of the chaos that they've made. Right now, even during COVID, we've not felt it, but so many firms are over leveraged, banks giving out precipitous amounts of non-performing loans and countries that are pegged or dependent on the dollar are exposed to this risk. Why does this risk manifest because of the world's global reliance on the dollar and why does it expand to other countries? Typically, because everyone's currency is related to their international reserves and they have to settle things like imports and exports in dollar, they have to convert the dollar, price stability is reliant on dollar, and all these things. Generally speaking, when the US goes down or when the US experiences harm, all these other countries experience harm due to the contagion effect of the dollar. So the counterfactual would be, presuming that you believe our alternative, the countries are substantially more autonomous. This gives them a variety of other options. Number one, they have the ability to hedge currency risk. If the US has experienced substantially more price instability, they're able to hedge it to other currencies like the euro or the yen. Moreover, this crisis response is also particularly tailored to their side. So maybe if they're okay with the currency inflating and the currency going down, they can stick with some mixture of currencies that is best for them. But moreover, the ability for you to hedge in the first place also improves the confidence that many investors have in emerging economies and emerging markets. Finally, I just also want to point out that crisis response on the opposition side is very, very expensive and very, very difficult because they're forced to pay back these goods, they're forced to pay back these loans, and they're forced to pay back price stability by forcing down their individual local currencies in dollars, which can get very, very expensive, particularly if it's a developed economy that's already quite if the US is a developed economy that's already quite rich. So what is the harm of exposing the world to systemic risk? I mean, I think this should be a little bit obvious that most countries around the world do not like experiencing systemic risk. And as a direct consequence, they are most likely to experience things like economic collapse when the US experiences it. The counterfactual, obviously, is that the US would have that current would have that crisis of currency or the crisis of reliance on the dollar solely confined to that country as well, or at the very least, the shockwaves of that would be slow enough such that other countries would be able to adjust. Moreover, other countries are hamstrung in their ability to respond to this economic crisis. So it makes it substantially cheaper for them to adopt. This has a load. This is a gigantic amount of impacts towards people on the ground. It means that they're more able to pay for food. It means that price stability means investors stay in the country for direct investments and flee the country. Essentially, people don't starve. As a direct consequence, economies are structurally stabler and happier for the future in the long term. I'll move on to the second country, a second argument that even if the US is not exposed to systemic risk, just that the US has a very, very drastically different economic strategy and monetary approach to things means that other countries have a much harder time surviving and doing well. But before that, I'll take a POI from CO.\n\n> POI: Okay, I think it's soft debating to say that there are a host of other alternatives. What is the most likely thing for specific countries to take? So if you're a country near China, what do you think their foreign currency reserve will look like?\n\nThe basket option, because they don't want to hedge so much. So presumably, if they think it's a bad idea to put all their money in China, you might make arguments to that effect, then they will likely put some money in the yen as well, maybe the pound. So moreover, we also think secondarily, it is much harder for countries to enact an economic strategy that is best for their country. It is difficult for them to pay for the debts because the dollar is much more expensive. Some countries will want to increase the value of their currencies to import, while others will want to decrease the value of their currency to export. This affects the price of goods in their country, essentially jettisoning price stability in their country. A good example of this is the US announcing gigantic rate hikes recently and forcing central banks all over Asia to follow the rate hikes of their own, leading to massive outflows of foreign investment, businesses collapsing and unable to survive unnecessary loans in times of crisis because the US was ready for rate hikes, but other countries were not. This forces essentially macroeconomic tightening cycles all around the world if they don't want their currency to collapse in terms of price because the fact that their price stability is itself pegged to the dollar already, which will have necessarily different directions in terms of monetary policy and fiscal policy than other countries will just because their economies are functionally different when it comes to the approach that they take to importing or exporting. This means it's difficult for them to change the value of their currency when America takes the opposite direction, which will make their approach useless and potentially even lead to things like stagflation where they get the worst of both worlds, and they might need to take additional measures like going into further debt, which will worsen the economic crisis potentially for the future. Not all countries may make good decisions, sure, but for the countries that have a corrupt and incompetent central bank, very little will actually change. But for the vast majority of countries where all the incentives are there to not get fired, to keep the economy stable, and they kick in, they are hamstrung by their reliance on the dollar. What is the broad impact of this argument? It means, number one, the poorest of the poor who are very, very different from the economy in the United States are least likely to be able to provide for foreign direct investment for their country. They're least likely to be able to keep investors in, which means that the availability of services like basic access to electricity, water, food, etc., because of the loss of price stability, as well as the loss of ability to control your own economy, as well as just the loss of the ability to keep the economy in the direction that keeps them here, means that people on the ground are again substantially more exposed to risk, are substantially reduced in terms of access to benefits and quality of life. It means, on the whole, the global reliance on the dollar has made things worse for everyone, and that's why we support its change. Thank you.\n"

                "content": "We won't be soft. The first thing I'd like to point out is the current economic crisis that is happening because the dollar has strengthened is due to a host of other factors that are external to the US economy. Things like COVID and the supply shock it has created, things like the Ukraine war that is intertwined with the way in which demand and supply globally has impacted the economy has meant that a lot of the things that you see as a symptom now have deeper reasons behind it. So I don't think illustrations of just suffering right now is good enough reason of this motion passing. We also prefer that the dollar is used by all countries around the world. We're happy to defend the norm of things like SWIFT or things like preferring credit cards from Visa instead of Chinese union pay. I'll talk about three broad things. First, why dollar is inherently less volatile than any other currency when pegged against. Secondly, why one currency within your foreign currency reserve, i.e. the dollar, is better than fracturing it into a basket of reserves, which opening government would like to defend. Third, why pegging against the dollar is an important foreign policy tool that we ought to give the United States. First, why is dollar inherently more stable? The first thing I'd like to posit is the US democratic system has the biggest checks and balances that make sure that the dollar has a floating value that is stable and predictable. There are three reasons under this. Number one, the US is the biggest economy in the world where it has diversified into primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors. So you have things like oil in primary and machines in secondary or even service sector in the tertiary, all of which means it is by far the most diversified economy where its currency, if you peg against, means you have inherently less risk. Number two, democratic checks and balances, the political institutions, the autonomy of the central bank, all are inherently more prone within the United States. The only thing OG says against this is our regulation has failed for a period of time. But even that, we've seen a lot of that removed because of the failures of 2008 and the recession it has caused. This is because the political system allows for you to recognize why you suffered at that point in time, hold politicians accountable, and have conversations about how you can best mitigate that crisis going forward, which is why a lot of regulation happened post 2008, simply because the institutions of the United States are stronger than anywhere else. Third, assuming all of this is not true, and maybe there is some level of lobbying that happens within the United States, predictability of the United States is far higher. Why is predictability important? This is because currency value is often based on hedging and on speculation. So the fact that you have access to information from a very free-floating economy and, you know, indices like S&P 500, or the fact that politicians are actively challenging each other and talking and discussing about where the economy is headed, or there are two really powerful political parties that are always going against each other, means there's always access to information for you to access and understand where this currency is going. Why is this comparatively worse in their world? The first thing I'd like to posit is small countries are unlikely to be rational actors, as they themselves would like to posit. This is because countries are nothing but an amalgamation of politicians who want to gain power within these small countries, who also have weaker institutions than the United States. What this means is when you have, like, you know, promises from Russia or China of really good economic inflow in the short term that puts you in power, you as an actor are often likely to trade off long-term economic risk, because at that point in time, when your tenure is over, it's something you don't need to care about. That's why a lot of these small countries around China have systematically sided with them. The difference is because the norm is you have to still use or peg yourself against the US dollar, your foreign currency reserve was not based on yuan or rubles. What this means is pressures from big actors means you might still end up with one other currency as your foreign currency reserve, except it'll be a far riskier economy that you're pegged against. First, because China and Russia are artificially controlled by their government. The currency float is artificially controlled, which means, although best case scenario, you just don't have information. How many of us know what the Chinese government is thinking or what Putin is thinking or what his next step will be? That breeds uncertainty and risk that makes your currency far more unstable. Number two, there's less ability for you to hold this government accountable in those cases, even if the alternative is the European Union. Maybe that is an alternative. It's unclear why that is. A federal state where the United States has control over budgets of different states and its problems means you're more able to control risks within that. But you can't control what the Greek government does, which inherently breeds more risk. The first argument proves inherently it is likely the foreign currency reserve will be on one currency instead of many. And when that happens, the US is inherently a better actor. And therefore, the US dollar is something we prefer. Second argument, fracturing. We think that there's an increasing likelihood that you will peg your currency in a way in which is really random, which means so evidence of the fact that India wants to trade in Indian rupees while Russia wants to trade in Russian rupees. The first reason is the failure of the dollar breeds insecurity. You don't know what the next big economy is. Is it Russia? Is it China? It's hard to often predict where the economy will be five years down the line. The second is oftentimes there are ways in which you're caught in the struggle of politics. That means you have to have different actors cater to at the same time. What this means is on a worst case, you will irrationally pick different currencies and put that as part of your basket. Why is this really bad? The first reason is when you have reserves in different kinds of currencies, you often make sure trade becomes more difficult with countries that don't have the basket in those same amount of currencies. So say country A pegs its reserves based on rubles, country B pegs its reserve based on yuans. The fracturing or the way you diversify that basket inherently creates more risk when you have to trade with each other because the conversion steps happen at an extra layer. So you first convert to yuan, then you convert to rubles, then you convert to the country you're trading with. What this ultimately means is you have less free trade between countries. Before that, I'll take a POI from closing.\n\n> POI: If the Chinese economy is that unstable, wouldn't countries be more likely to choose the euro than they would the yuan?\n\nFirst, you need to explain the incentives of EU to diversify to the same extent as China. Second, the politicians within these small countries and the way they interact. That's analysis that you're missing. So the first thing I'd like to posit is free trade becomes far more difficult when there are more layers in the conversion process of currencies. What this means is comparative advantage shrinks. The alternative that we defend is one US dollar that inherently allows everyone to trade with each other, that minimize the cost of international trade and allows you to specialize, which improves your ability to export and import and have efficiency among economies. So fracturing in and of itself is a bad thing. Lastly, this is a tool that the US uses as a tool of global politics. So the fact that all countries have dollars pegged to it allows the US to sanction countries like Russia. Why is this important? And why is this an actor that we want internationally? First, US has internal accountability versus any other actor. It has a diversity of minorities that care about global issues because they're from those countries, our families there, or they consist of educated liberals that care about external issues. Chinese populations or Russian populations are unlikely to do so to a greater degree. Further reasons for this in DLO, but it's evidently clear that the dollar is less risky than the alternatives. Very glad to oppose.\n"

                "debater_name": "OG",
                "content": "First on the stability of the dollar. On face, I want you to note that the stability of the dollar does not mean that the economic interests of the US necessarily match those of all the other nations that are pegged or use the dollar. I even if the dollar is stable, the fact that they want to increase the value of their currency, whereas many developing nations seek to decrease the value of the currency in order to increase the attractivity of the exports means that just because it is stable does not mean it's preferable. And all the reasons that they give an opening opposition is why it's so difficult to change. And it is up to the political interests within the US make it such that the autonomy that these individual nations have are never going to be accessed on their side of the house. Stability does not equal the benefit. Secondly, they say, what do you peg it to? And that all these other countries are for some reason so stupid and irrational, and therefore they'll just pick whatever comes their way. The first thing I want to note is that if this is the context opening opposition wants to deal in, any kind of economic policy they pursue is not likely to be very smart, and therefore the change is marginal on either side of the house. But in the instances that these economies have, independent central banks have shared economic interests, and oftentimes economies are the main ways in which politicians win an election anyway and to be able to determine their stability. It is unclear to me why it is so. First, the diversification of currency argument makes no sense. If you peg it to the value basket of currencies, you have to convert on every individual currency in order to make trade. You can just do it with the country you're trading with. It is a matter of the value. But secondly is, what do they peg it to? Not only do they purely assert they make bad decisions with whom they're going to peg it to, but secondly is, I think their assumptions of you just peg it to China, you'll peg it to Russia are uncomparative. Not only have these historically, when the nations that are the most lax with respect to economic trade, have imposed the least restrictions with respect to giving loans, and therefore are unlikely to be the ones that force you into this kind of negotiation. But secondly is, in a global decline where all these countries maybe seek economic interest in being able to have you peg your currency to them, I would say you restart a competitive process in which in order for countries to convince you to be able to take on their currency or to be able to put them within your basket, it is much more likely that favorable trade negotiations, investment within your country in the inflow of capital, and being able to ensure the startup specific industries in this country is how they are managed to do that. The important nuance here is that the point in which the dollar was widely adopted was around the 30s, 40s, in order to ensure the widespread of the buttonwoods institutions, and oftentimes this is a period after World War II where economies were entirely desperate. I would say the context and status quo where there's likely more leverage and autonomy for these nations is where they are much more likely to be able to make a smart decision about this. So they cannot pick such a convenient context and say this is going to be all the countries and therefore we win the debate. That is not the case. Thirdly, they say this is an important tool within international relations. The first thing I want to be able to note is that it is unclear to me why the unhampered power of America to be able to make significant decisions with respect to economic sanctions and how they work is a good tool within politics. The first thing I want to be able to note is that while some countries or especially powerful nations can afford sanctions, there are many other nations that are smaller and are unable to meaningfully impact the nature of sanctions, make a country as big as Russia budge, but are more likely to ensure that they feel the effect of those sanctions such that they have less trade, they have less imports, etc. So it is not a winning game for a lot of these smaller nations where they have such minimal impact on this country, but at the same time, they take on the brunt of increased tariffs, they take on the brunt of increased prices of imports, etc. And therefore, that is not fair for them. But secondly, I don't think that's a good thing. I think if America wanted to impose widespread sanctions on another nation, it is much better to be able to force that through international and multilateral organizations, or being able to build consensus within all of these different countries, because it is impossible for me to believe that American international relations and their interests are always positive in nature. A lot of the time they have sanctioned regimes that or rather they have sanctioned nations that have simply disagreed with them and favored other authoritarian regimes with a lot or significant amounts of hypocrisy. It is impossible for me to believe that just being able to do this is much better than being able to choose from a myriad of alternatives coming from opening government. What am I going to argue in extension? I want to explain why the shift of many global economies to trade and labor exploitation towards the US has led to significant amounts of exploitation for a lot of developing economies. But before I move on, I'll take the POI from Closing Opposition.\n\n> POI: Yeah, Miko, in a world where these current countries are using smaller currencies and a variety of smaller currencies, doesn't that decrease the amount of information and stability to get out each of the choices that they're making?\n\nThat's, first of all, unclear to me as to why that decreases the amount of information. But secondly, insofar as you have more choices of that currency, I think it is much better for you to be able to do so. In fact, I would just make the argument that this gives incentives for mutual stability of the economies of other countries, insofar as you don't have to rely on just the US being stable, but also ensuring surrounding economies you trade with are also stable. And therefore, the amount of investment that is mutual within countries, the amount and their ability to loan and be able to give to each other in periods of economic crisis increases as well. How have countries reacted to the dependence on the dollar? I think it's a couple of things. Firstly, they've significantly redirected trade to either the US or US dollar-using economies. And the importance of that is that while I think this is a fair decision to make, it is the decision that should be made on how much can you sell your goods for? How much are you able to ensure that they will have a large market and therefore buy your products? Because there are many other good options for them to pick, like Europe, like China, et cetera, in order for them to be able to export their goods. But the reason they do this is because the large dependence on the dollar means that you need a significant amount of foreign currency reserves in US dollar in order to keep your economy afloat. And what that entails is you have to shift the way your economy works in order to receive those kinds of foreign currency reserves. Rather than what might be most strategic for your economy as a consequence. So that means that when trade could have been more favorable for you, when you likely could have had a greater ability to determine your policy, you were unable to do that because you need the dollar as a consequence. And this has also significantly impacted the ability of loaning institutions in order to ensure that you are also receiving US dollars in loans, but you also cannot inflate the value of your currency in order to pay those loans off. And therefore, the power, the coercive power of the IMF and of the World Bank as more and more countries sign on gets more and more powerful as well. And what they have often entailed are neoliberal policies that favor exportation to the US to the detriment or exploitation from the US, the detriment of building up local industry. But lastly, and the reason this is also bad is that many developing economies have shifted to the exportation of talented and important labor from their countries to work in the US. And that's important because the reason they do that is because they want remittances from the wages they get to go back to their home country. And that's a bad thing because for many developing economies, what you need is skilled and talented labor to build up industries, to move from manual labor and primary industries to more secondary service-based tertiary industries. But when they instead leave your country and compete in the US, not only do they not necessarily live better off lives because there's a greater amount of competition, you strip away developing economies of their way in which they can develop by diversifying industry, improving the nature of their economy because they needed the dollar. I'm very, very proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "The reason Open Government is out of this debate is because in DPM, they claim stability is not preferable. Two reasons why this is not true. Number one, if stability is something that we already have on our side, which they have conceded to a certain extent, by the way, means that a stable currency is much easier to hold a standard against. So for example, controlling or floating your currency against one stable currency is far easier. So for example, if you want to devalue a currency in that particular sense, it's easier to control it and hedge it against the US dollar, because then you don't have to care about how the yuan is moving, or the euro is moving, or the pound is moving, and so on and so forth. One standard is much better in terms of stability and so on and so forth. Secondly, markets are far more predictable, right? When you are trading with a particular country, when different countries, companies are trading with each other, when you have a basket of currencies within your reserves, and you do not know which sort of a currency that you're going to get from that particular country, it's far harder to predict the value of goods and so on and so forth. This is incredibly important, because if you don't know the value of goods, you wouldn't know how much to order. If you don't know how much to order, your ability to trade with other countries, smaller countries that opening up is so concerned about, goes down at that particular point in time, because of the simple reason that you do not have markets, currency markets that are as predictable anymore, you're more likely to trade with countries with more stable economies, rather than countries which has certain advantages, such as low labor costs and so on and so forth, which is very important on our side, because that's how they achieve economic growth and so on and so forth. Number three, and this is also to a certain extent integrated within stability and so on and so forth, they said that, oh, but every country now caters to the US, but literally, like, no, like every other country trades with every other country on the basis of reserve currency, because of the fact that every country in the world has a dollar reserve, even freaking Russia has a dollar reserve, which has been frozen, that's a different story. But even Russia has a dollar reserve means that you can trade with any other country in the world, because you can use the predictability of the US dollar to hedge against. So for example, when Zambia wants to trade with Rwanda, they can use a dollar as a convertibility in between these two currencies in a world where you hedge against that particular currency, currency basket that becomes far more difficult to do. Why is the currency basket so bad? Because I think CGA will probably have to defend it on based on the rules of debating and so on and so forth. I'll give you four broad reasons why. And rebuttals integrated. Number one, they said that the dollar is not good because they like regulations and so on and so forth do not exist. Untrue, after 2008, we have the Dodd-Frank Act and so on and so forth, the US has become far more sort of sensible in terms of financial regulations. Secondly, they said that on net, the US economy and the US financial system is deregulated. We tell you it's a good thing that it's on net deregulated. What are the alternatives that you have? You have China that is not deregulated, that it's heavily, the financial system is heavily hedged against its housing market, which can bust at any point in time because the housing construction across the world can go down and that market itself can go down at any point in time because the construction companies of China are not making profits currently. Secondly, it's captured by oligopolies on the alternative. If you have a deregulated market, you have more competition, you have more and it's easier to enter into the market. Like companies such as Lehman Brothers can just be not bailed out and shoved out of the market because it's possible to do so because they're not an oligopoly that have captured the entire US market because it's a deregulated market, which is not possible in other major economies. You can say, ah, but the euro is great and so on and so forth. Number one, the euro is a far smaller economy. Two, euro has very similar structures with US, it's basically a budget US. At that point in time, why do you want to complicate things with the euro and so on and so forth? Number three, it also has countries such as Greece, Portugal and Italy with far worse balance sheets within their economies and have different regulations all across, not a standardized form of regulations. Standardized form of regulations are important in order to have some predictability within financial markets because deregulated economies allow you to see information within these markets, see information within stock markets, see information within these companies and disclose information, access information because the economy is literally run on information and that's a good thing that you have in the US. So you don't have to go looking for Greece's balance sheets because that's a bad thing. Thirdly, we tell you that to a large extent, the reason why the US is so stable to a certain extent, and this is true, is through a self-fulfilling prophecy of the dollar being so big, right? And this is quite important because what I posit to you here is that hypothetically, if we could make one country the home of the one standard currency, that would possibly be the best thing possible idealistically. But here, the US is the best actor in this particular instance rather than hedging it towards multiple actors because that the US is the only country that has the dollar, it has the ability to go for things like loans and fiscal stimuluses, which does not have too much impact on its economy. The reason it's very important is because the 2008 financial crisis would have been far, far worse if the US generally did not have the ability to bail out so many companies and bail out its own, not bail out companies, but bail out its own economy so easily. And the COVID-19 crisis would have been so much worse. By the way, the COVID-19 crisis literally hit every economy in the world. In a hedged economic sense, you would have been far more fucked unless you did not rely on the US because the reason Biden was able to give so easily fiscal stimulus checks to people was because of the fact that it had the backing of the US dollar, and he knew that the US dollar denomination is the most powerful in the world and it won't lose its value. Therefore, it was able to take loans from external actors because they know that the US loans are the most stable investment. It's pretty much a self-fulfilling prophecy because the US dollar is so powerful, it allows itself to get out of recessions in vast majority of cases, not even get into recessions to begin with. And that's quite important in terms of controlling economies. Before I move on, I'll take one from OG.\n\n> POI: Okay, your claim that the US is also on its own sometimes stable is missing the point. Our point is that other currencies also diversify in ways that the US doesn't. And the best way to hedge most structural risk is to hedge across many currencies rather than just one.\n\nAmazing. What is the comparative in this particular instance? The comparative is in vast majority of the cases because of the way in which the economies are intertwined. First of all, if the US is in a crisis, almost certainly the euro is in a crisis because of the fact that they are so intertwined as an economy generally. In a lot of cases, I've already told you the structural problems with the Chinese economy. But the problem here is every economy by the sense of economics goes through a boom and bust cycle, right? At that particular point in time, would you rather hedge your bets on that one economy that you know can use the dollar to fortify its economy in multiple levels versus five or six currencies where you have no guarantee that these economies will be able to fortify their own economies through the ability of that singular currency? Because in those particular instances, the ability of having that singular currency is so very important that you lose out at the point in time you create a basket. The point at which Chinese economy goes into recession, there is no escaping from this. But when the US goes into recession, there is an easy way out in that particular sense. Lastly, in terms of why is it more important from the perspective of say, countries like Russia and why we should essentially ban for countries like Ukraine, because the alternative is far worse in terms of geopolitics and so on and so forth. The Chinese and the Russians do not have as much accountability mechanisms as the US just in terms of geopolitics. If you want your ability to stop countries like Russia from going into war, penalize countries to a global standard that has essentially a global country that has things like democratic mechanisms within it, you want the US to have the dollar power. Because otherwise, literally most of the sanctions with Russia does not work. Because a lot of countries, including Europe, want to trade with Russia at that point in time. The reason you can put so much pressure on Russia and the reason Ukraine hasn't given up on it, given up yet, is because of the simple fact that you could put so much pressure through the financial system. Without that, you're not able to do so within these countries. And you allow a lot of these problems within that world to persist. In the end, we have a far better economy and a far better world. The US dollar needs to persist. Incredibly proud to oppose.\n"

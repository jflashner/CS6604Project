                "content": "During one of the scariest economic episodes that the world is experiencing, a war, a pandemic, high commodity prices, high levels of debt, this is functionally the worst time ever to track implement austerity. Our case of opening government is extremely simple. This is going to lead to massive economic slowdown in countries that are going to be horrible for them and trigger a global economic crisis or at the very least a slowdown. So instead, why is this slow economic growth going to impact on debt? On setup, firstly we are going to remove all current conditions except for anti-corruption things. Secondly, we are going to do this so long as current economic conditions proceed, probably throughout the pandemic, probably until the invasion ends. In general, we are just against conditionalized loans. We think if conditionalized loans have to be implemented, now is the worst time to report that. I want to start with some characterization about what the global economic context currently is. Firstly, Russia's invasion of Ukraine means that it's becoming prohibitively more expensive for developing countries to do things like import a variety of food, given that Ukraine is often involved in supply chains. Secondly, commodity prices are lower than they were, so relatively high, making it a lot more expensive for countries to do things like import gas, which is very important to sustaining businesses. And thirdly, there's still massive aftershocks of the pandemic. There can be new waves, countries might still need to do things like have quarantines and be able to shut down. There's still things like supply chain shocks that are ultimately existing, which will often lead to debt as a result of state spending and stuff like that. So the economy is pretty bad. How are these conditions going to slow down the economy? I want to discuss this in three different ways. The most basic way is that market-based reforms are often about protecting for the budget deficit. What this functionally means are decreasing state spending and increasing forms of taxation that's going to exist. This is a huge problem because all of these policies usually slow down demand within the domestic economy. If taxes are higher, consumers have less money to go to small businesses and to buy things that often sustain the larger economy. When you're removing the budget deficit by decreasing subsidies to corporations that are going to accrue, they have less money to be able to sustain through operations. This is extremely powerful by the money multiplier that tends to exist. That is, even a small degree of increased state spending within the economy trickles down a long way because you use your money to hire someone else. When you hire someone else, you're able to buy more food. That supports a corporation and it functionally happens in a cyclical way. I want to preempt that states might be bad at spending. Firstly, this is often money directly in the hands of people. While you are doing things like lowering taxes, it is people have more money to spend in ways that are meaningful for them. It's often about subsidies that are vital in sustaining my ability to buy bread than that frees up more money for me to be able to do other things. Secondly, though, even if states spend in shit ways, it functionally doesn't matter. I'd rather have a government spending money to help their SOE because the SOE is still part of the state economic engine. The SOE still employs people. The SOE still exports oil to other states despite all the current forms of GDP that tend to exist. Secondly, though, this will harm the economy because you need to spend more money buying international currency reserves that are just expensive, especially given that other currencies are often more appreciated relative to your own currency and then you have less money to spend for the people. Thirdly, most importantly, floating your currency right now is one of the worst ideas in history. There's a lot of developing countries who have a pen to a more stable currency or a basket of currencies like the dollar or the euro. When you have a poor economic foundation because they already have a lot of debt as it currently stands, they already have less money to compete in terms of spending, that's going to place massive inflationary pressures on their currency, which is what's going to happen in other countries like Egypt when they try to float their currency. This is really bad because if you have huge inflation, this is terrible for individuals' quality of life within the country itself given that contracts often can't keep up with inflation because wages are often fixed, but more importantly, that often leads to things like capital flood. Why? Because no one is going to want to do business in a country where you functionally have to hold your currency that is now relatively worthless, like within your own business coffers. Know that all these things also are likely to trigger a cycle of declining economic conditions as well, because even if only a couple of businesses are hard, even if spending slightly decreases, all these lower things like economic indicators and given a lot of economic stability functions on the basis of speculation and how investors and other people perceive your economy to be, there's all mechanism for why we can get things like capital flood. Before I make like seven impacts, let's look at the POI.\n\n> POI: Why are countries dumb enough to accept the law instead?\n\nBecause they need money, because they have a lot of debt and they have to pay back to their creditors, they are deafening when people are starving and they want to not have a political crisis that's going to exist. They don't think that functionally their alternatives are either worse, either China who has more commissions on loans, or they're just extremely desperate and they're forcing this at the end of the day. Why is it bad then to trigger a degree of economic crisis? First of all, the quality of life of people just goes down. Even if people leave like no other impacts when there won't be an economic crisis, things like having money to buy bread and fertilizer, if you're living in the bottom, 10% diversity is a clear impact. And more importantly, when all these factors trickle a wider pseudonym, it's over for equality of life in other ways. If businesses go down, this means a lot of people suffer from things like unemployment. Secondly though, it's more likely to trigger a slaughtering doubt. Crisis is going to exist within a lot of states. But when economics sometimes begin, it is harder to tap into international credit markets. Because people are only going to be willing to buy the bonds of your country at the point where they think that there's a viable chance that those bonds are actually going to be paid back. And at the point where that's more difficult, because things like state reserves are decreasing, because the economy in general is doing worse, people are less likely to loan you money. So either you get fewer bonds, or the bonds that you do get have more restorative interest rates, which is a little bad because you have less money to be able to spend for other things. And maybe it's likely to have a debt crisis that matters a lot because A, it's bad for your country's credit reputation. It makes it harder to re-tap into international credit markets going into the future. And number two, there's a larger view of economic interconnectness between different countries. So even if you think that our case is a bit extreme, and only one or two countries basically have a tipping point for them, like Sri Lanka during the pandemic, doing that banks often hold money in other banks within other countries, the economy of one country decreases and has massive tranquil benefits to the economies in other states. Thirdly, the equity economy going down means that you're going to have to need more loans from the IMF going into the future. Because if there is an economic contraction, that means that people are poor. If people are poor, do you know what that means? Your country needs even more money. So even if you don't have austerity, it's not likely that you're going to need one or two loans from the IMF, or on the other side of the house, you have more of a Pakistan-type scenario, where you need to keep going back to the IMF seven times, which preempts any potential off-argument that the institutions aren't going to want to lend out money, because there was less conditioning to the point that you need less than two loans in the first place. Fourth reason why this is so important is that this can trigger a political crisis when the economy goes down, but look at what happened with Sri Lanka at the beginning of the pandemic. When people do things like lose access to their subsidies, they go to the streets because they're angry, they're upset, and they're hungry. This is not going to trigger things like the downfalls of entire governments, which is important because you can't have any policy advocacy, you can't do things like treat the pandemic, you can't even cast basic budgets, when governments are constantly cycling this point to this, things like strikes are often extremely bad for the economy, given that businesses often cease to operate in this capacity. Fifthly though, this means that in the future, this is going to decrease the legitimacy of the IMF and push people to reverse alternatives. This is both because they're going to be forced to go to other alternatives if they simply cannot afford this, thereby preempting what we hear from closing opposition, or they just don't hate the IMF because they blame them for worsening their quality of life in their critical juncture when individuals were already suffering, meaning that it's more likely that they're going to have to seek out other loans from like China and other institutions. Why is this worse? Firstly, even if you don't think that China is the worst actor to back you, even though they often just do charging like exorbitant industries, it gives countries like China a lot more bargaining power over how they issue loans, because I think it's good under the status quo that we're able to shop for them, possibly go to the IMF, possibly go to China, because it gives you more bargaining power between the two institutions, and there you can push for things like lower interest rates as a developing country. If now you're more desperate and you can only go to China, the function makes you a monopoly over loans provision, meaning that like clauses in the loans over like you're really going to be able to cease more of your collateral, we're going to be able to charge you higher interest rates, we can go up or worse. But secondly, I would just posit that China is often a worse actor in general, because they often have things like we're going to cease more of your ports, they often care less about conformity to like global norms when it comes to interest rates, maybe we're just docking up substantially more. For all of these reasons, I'm extremely proud to see China opening up.\n"

                "content": "The strategy from OG I found quite peculiar, and the reason is it just creates an overwhelming degree of symmetry in the round. Will their policies actually correct isn't really answered, so it makes it very easy, given the defensiveness of their case, to just suggest simply that countries need these measures to resuscitate a dynamic problem. I'll do a couple of things. First, that's mostly integrated though in two arguments. One, on why we're leaving these conditions increases debt massively, increasing the risk of default and all of the other bad things in this round. Second, on why money is loaned to countries that cannot pay it back, and why that means that the IMF becomes less effective going forward. In terms of reputation to the profiteers, the first thing I want to note is I want to suggest that the way that the supply chains exist right now doesn't mean that it's going to be permanently and forever economically devastating for these countries. There is a way out, and the reason is that substitution effects are relatively strong. A thing like OPEC not listening to the demands of Russia, countries instituting caps, for example, means that the degree of economic rehabilitation that's being worked towards from the international community is relatively effective. They also say that this type of money is really important because it goes towards things like cash transfers to individuals. This is far too generic a stance. Given that this is about particularly financial decisions that are being made by countries and are being made toward reducing budgetary deficits, it seems like spending massively is probably a negative way of trying to correct that harm. But more than that, it's just not clear whether or not giving money actually solves, given that presumably the inflow of more and more money into the economy only worsens inflationary spirals. But more than that, I think that the claim on floating is actually quite meaningful. I think that these austerity measures are particularly directed toward the collection of currency reserves, which can correct for this given that you're paying to currencies that are far less volatile. Furthermore, their claim on interconnectiveness. I think this is solved for by regulation that already exists, which reduces the degree of exposure of banks and other countries to any given financial institution and country for that matter, which means that the degree of harm they claim for that is very, very small. I'll return to China in the arguments then. First argument on why removing these conditions increases debt massively. The first thing I want to point out is that high rates of quantitative easing and high spending are very, very likely on their side, and we get no reason why that isn't the case. In fact, we get arguments that suggest that there is going to be higher spending on citizens, which presumably actually doesn't fix things. There are a couple of reasons to note why it's the case that they are unlikely to get any sort of solvency in terms of the economic problems that they have. One, there's a strong degree in developing countries of a need to pander toward voters in the capacity of dual out cash that means that it's very, very difficult for countries to make economic decisions that are in the best of citizens. Another reason is that the frequent histories of socialism that permeate lots of these countries means that their societies and their governmental systems are often geared towards those types of policies which trade off necessarily the types of capitalist policies that are probably necessary. But third, and this is most important, connections with wealthy elite classes are really important and affect the stability of developing countries because their buying is necessary toward the stability of government. So fertilizer subsidies, for example, are only really valuable at scale, so these are the types of policies that are particularly designed to benefit the wealthiest classes. So that is why it is very difficult in their world to actually implement policies in the first place that are necessary toward alleviating suffering. This takes these economies down because industries massively are struggling. The IMF imposing these sorts of measures, though, actually corrects for the high amount of debt and there are a few reasons. One, it gives the political capital necessary for politicians to get away with implementing these policies in the first place so they can blame the IMF for tying their hands and forcing them to impose necessary policies on their citizens. And this anticipates the response of the legitimacy crisis from opening governments because free conditions mean governments cannot access these narratives in the first place, that when politicians claiming to pander and represent the citizens on the ground can no longer apply that same degree of pressure because fundamentally it was never the Prime Minister's decision in the first place. So the cases where governments are relatively weak, for example, and where citizens are most at risk are especially important because this foregoes any sort of legitimacy crisis that they might individually incur by suggesting that it is the international community that is forcing them to take these actions in the first place. Second, we would suggest that conditions actually encourage market confidence and that suggests that money increases at a huge, huge rate. And the reason is emerging markets are actually quite attractive towards investors, the reason being that they have burgeoning industries and more than that, that there's just a huge upside to where there would be a minimal amount of capital that you could have added input in the first place. So the capacity for gain is very, very high. So investment then is a risk-reward calculation. The problem is, in their side, they massively inflate the risks that investors perceive in investing in otherwise possibly stable or long-term, possibly fruitful countries because they suggest that the only thing that matters are the complete will to these countries to make every single decision. So this is really important and it fixes a key problem which demonstrates sufficiency. The reason being that wealthier people now are benefited too because more money is coming in in the first place. This increases money a lot. And that is important in the short term because it means you're able to pay off the huge amounts of debts that you have collected and frees up long-term money towards spending on people. No thanks. Third, IMF is likely to increase interest rates on their loans should they be doled out in their world because there are no conditions on it virtually. That means that the default risk skyrockets because you have to pay much, much more in a short period of time. But second, it means the turn to China in their world is actually far more likely. The reason being that China offers you loans at high rates, yes, but if comparable to the IMF with even fewer restrictions, you probably end up taking China more often and more frequently in their world. The impact here is very simple. Your life is really, really difficult in a world that is affected by spiraling debt, etc. So that means that you are worse off in a world without debt since you use it providing no solvency bill.\n\n> POI: If your criticism is that a lot of this money goes towards wealthy elites, then why were they putting restrictions on farming and fertilizer subsidies?\n\nYeah, yeah, that was way at the top. It was that fertilizer subsidies exist at scale and that benefits elites. Second argument, money is loan to countries that cannot pay it back. A lot of countries that are given loans in the world of government will not be able to pay it back. There are inflationary spirals that happen and tons and tons of money flows into your economy. There is a lack of policy, and importantly, there are people on both sides of the political aisle. There is a slow amount of time where it takes a long amount of time to make decisions on what types of policies you want to implement in the first place. That short term delay in policies actually getting applied is really, really important for the effectiveness and the capacity of countries to actually contain the extent of debt crisis that they face. So more countries end up getting access to their loans on their side admittedly. This is bad. Why? Because it trades off with IMF loan programs just existing. There is a huge loss of money that comes when countries struggle to pay back IMF loans and end up defaulting at a higher rate. Second, countries that make up the IMF end up not wanting to devote as much money to the IMF. There are two scenarios here. Either the US, in an attempt to gain legitimacy, continues to exist in the IMF and devotes their money largely, and other countries don't at a high rate, which means your basically sole debtor is the US, and they are the only country that actually gets to dictate the types of economic policies that are made, which is probably worse. But second, I just think lots of countries that exist in the IMF just start rolling back their contributions, giving much less money, which means the IMF as an institution is much less effective. I think this is important because obviously the IMF is important, right? They give a ton of money to countries. They can insulate them from the possible risks of debt and inflationary spirals, which means that countries that desperately need their money can get access to it. In their world, the IMF becomes far less effective and doesn't have the capacity to be able to provide these policies in the first place. On that basis, oppose.\n"

                "debater_name": "OG",
                "content": "Even if OO does not like non-market policies, the reality is that these policies are deeply entrenched and do not just subsidize elites. The most dangerous default risk that exists in this debate is exposing countries at the moment of the largest economic vulnerability and at the moment where they are most reliant on the particular mix of currency subsidization, subsidies for various industries, etc. to markets which will immediately arbitrage and wreck their currencies, imposing interest rates that are punitive on these things, we propose. The first thing I want to do is explain why the IMF is still going to be strong and still have a lot of buy-in, even in a world where we don't attach conditions. Their argument is twofold. Number one, the IMF will lose a lot of money. For one, I think that there will be some additional money coming because a larger number of developing countries will succeed in the long term at a commonwealth year and becoming middle income countries. And in turn, because they will never impose the conditions, will not normatively dislike the IMF as much, their voters will not project it as much, and funding will be more politically palatable. But that is a smaller response compared to the fact that the IMF has never been about income on loans. Almost all its loans are given at prime rates, and in particular, countries in the IMF that fund it gain power and voting rights at the IMF based on sheer contribution size. There is also a balance that is readjusted every once in a while depending again on contribution size and geopolitical size. The implication of this is as follows. You never want to cut your contributions to the IMF because then you have less power over how they are built out. And you are still significantly exposed to how they are built out given OO's own argument. Which implies there is very little incentive to be a first mover country and pull your funding away from the IMF. But I also think their argument on higher interest rates makes zero sense. The threat of losing money to Chinese expansionism and One Belt One Road and other associated infrastructure bank projects are a reason why you won't make your interest rates very high. Now, their better version of that claim is that you are now exposed to a lot more risk in terms of the debt. So you are going to make rates higher. But the problem is the worst thing for countries is default risk. It is not that you make a little bit less money on interest. Which implies that if countries know that there is a higher risk of default from charging period of interest rates, they will not in fact charge period of interest rates. Because they are a cost of restructuring debt that accrues to their country in the future. The people who decide this aren't politicians, they are bureaucrats, they know this. They are the IMF delegation, etc. Very, very unlikely. I will add as well that it is historically completely not true. The IMF was repurposed to give loans that had conditions in the 70s when after the fall of Bretton Woods there was no more bureaucratic purpose for the IMF. But there were still lots of workers there and they had to repurpose themselves. At the moment of the 1970s and 80s that made sense. They turned into a mechanism to give loans and attach austerity conditions and do structural adjustment programs. But there is nothing inherent to the IMF to require conditionality. The IMF gave non-conditional loans to many developing world countries alongside the World Bank as it existed in the 1950s. With zero problem and much lower rates of default than happened in the 1970s. We moved towards structural adjustment. I will get to the structural reasons for this in my second area which is explaining why this is likely to cause an economic crisis. Before I go on, opening.\n\n> POI: Isn't the implication of conditionality existing suggesting that countries that have huge amounts of voting rights desire austerity and conditionality as a contingency for their contributions in the first place?\n\nI don't think it's true that governments want to tie their hands in this way. Maybe in a limited number of cases their claim is right and governments can say I get to impose austerity now because the IMF is forcing my hand. The problem is this is a theoretical claim and if you look on the ground this is not true. In Pakistan a government is about to be toppled because basically of the factor of default associated with high levels of conditions. In Sri Lanka a foreign exchange crisis was caused in part because governments were unable to pay off their debt associated with conditionality. In the immediate preceding present right now we are seeing a high level of geopolitical strife and in particular a high level of countries who directly due to their involvement in structural adjustment policies have had major economic problems. Their secondary claim on this is that a lot of the policies governments would do are because of bad incentives and for some reason because fertilizer scales they are not giving money to lots of people for subsidies. I think one, this is just empirically ignorant of what is going on. In Sri Lanka the entire thing was over a fuel subsidy program that affected literally every single person at the gas pump. Very often this has been appeasing important rural constituencies that matter due to the fact of their geographic importance because of the way that political writings function that tend to give larger degrees of control to rural areas. So very often this ends up being the same thing that benefits individual people particularly lobbyists that are quite large like farmers, like people who work in the trade that make up the large number of poor people in the country. But second of all I think that countries even when they have a loan have a sufficient level of independence, a sufficient level of incentive that means that they probably won't do bad things. This means even without conditions the very fact of having a loan is important. Why? Historically many developing countries have had governments topple in significant backlash to a perception that they were not managing to get loans from foreign creditors well. That means you don't want to default on loans because this could trigger a political crisis. Newspapers and opposition will say you spent irresponsibly. So this is very important. Having a loan is the important thing. The conditions that are attached to a loan in fact look bad because the rhetoric is now they have sold out to the foreign government, they are Western. That is literally what Iran is kind of saying to the current Pakistani government in his bid to get back in power and say we don't want this element of conditionality. Why is the economic slowdown incredibly likely? I think what Naomi proves is that even small degrees of economic slowdown that happen when you remove stimulus from countries that are not yet over the pandemic that have major supply shocks is a problem. The only response is to say some supply chains can pivot. I think this is hard number one because there are massive sanction loads around the world that have to do with Russia. Countries are facing a cap for example on the price of Russian fuel. Many countries can't pivot their supply chains easily. But also because years of globalisation structurally mean that supply chains are highly optimised and mean that finished goods as they are made across the world go through many many different areas for very particular parts of a component or of a supply chain like services, accounting or whatever. Which means it is very hard to pivot supply chains into the long run. Also doing this requires money which you need to get from loans. Pivoting your supply chain implies massive reinvestment, building new ports, building new universities etc. And this stuff is more likely to occur on our side of the house. Their last claim under this is that there is going to be a high likelihood of default because states are unlikely to pay back. I am willing to concede in a very very low number of cases that there is a slight higher likelihood of default into the long term. I still think this is worth it. For one, countries are able to get themselves out of a heavy heavy moment of geopolitical weakness and economic weakness right now. That means into the long run they are able to take advantage of everything I have been pointing out about the multiplier effect of a growing economy to get out of the crisis and emerge stronger. If there is a likelihood of default passing out to states in the future, they will be better equipped to solve it. Why? Because the economy will become larger, it will be more stable. That means that if they have to raise taxes to pay off default or if they find it harder to raise money in the future, they will have a lower need because they were able to get the money now out of a moment of need. But second of all, in the future, western governments will be less overstretched. They won't be facing a fuel crisis. They won't be facing Ukraine. So they will be able to afford to be more generous in terms of rearranging debt even if it didn't have conditions. Which implies that even if there is a literal worst case in the future where there is a higher risk of default in the future and you manage better on our side of the house, we will have gotten the money to countries at the moment when they need it. What is the implication of this? We think that these conditions, even if they achieve some market reforms, are not good market reforms. If you float an interest rate, that exposes a huge amount of risk to a country where for a long time they have massaged currency values and interest rates. That means people will very much struggle because their wealth will immediately erode overnight and be subject to arbitrage and foreign traders. The Asian financial crisis happened when a peg was removed and it was exposed to fluctuations emerging from floating interest rates and foreign speculators who poured hot money into their country. That is what countries are ripe for at a moment of geopolitical instability. We are very proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "The shadow of coronism has ravaged Latin America for decades now. It is absurd for OG to say that it is always good to increase spending and that that always allows countries to get out of poverty. Rather, I think it's pretty intuitive in and around that countries must strike a balance between spending and restraining debt. This question is about which side is better able to find that balance. OG tried to duck this burden by saying, oh, this is a time of crisis, this is a really bad time to impose austerity. But the burden is to support this and perpetuity as opposed to just right now. What the IMF is doing right now and why it's removed these conditions is because in response to the crisis they're talking about, they have lent more and become over leveraged. In order to make sure that this does not wreck their ability to make this money back and send investors fleeing, we must impose conditions and at least reassure investors. The response we got from Max is that, well, obviously the IMF will continue to function and countries will still buy in. Three responses to this. The first thing is, I think it's strange to claim that you won't pull out because the contributions that you make or conditions would access those in the future. The reason for this is that countries that borrow from the IMF are predominantly ones that are relatively low income as opposed to the US, as opposed to EU, Germany, Spain, etc. For those reasons, I think the biggest investors are very much concerned about the IMF's ability to continue to make money because they don't need the loans that they're using as leverage. This also drove hedge funds, private investors, so on and so forth. We're not saying the IMF stops functioning, but we are saying it becomes more difficult for them to make money and therefore they then end up loaning to fewer countries in the future and also that they increase interest rates in response to all of this and that's not great. Okay, three clashes today. The first clash is to what extent do IMF loans restrict spending? Because this is not about restrict without having some government spending versus having zero government spending, rather it's about reducing government spending and whether this is going to be effective at striking the balance. I think there are two reasons why the IMF is good at finding the balance that reduces unnecessary expansionary spending while making sure that average people can continue to make a living and basically survive. The reason for this, as they themselves characterize, the IMF wants the money to be paid back. For those reasons, if the government informs them that there are certain subsidy programs that they need in order to keep the government crashing and burning, then they're unlikely to impose that restriction onto them or they'll factor that into the contract. Because remember that the IMF does not just rock up and say here's the standardised set of policies that every single country must follow because that would be hugely catastrophic and every country is different, rather there is a negotiation process between the country and between the IMF. This is likely to go well just because I think the IMF, as they say, is also concerned about their reputation and has changed over the past few decades. But the second main reason for this is because there is a large amount of government spending that is unnecessary. A lot of subsidies, for example, are regressive as opposed to progressive because it is far easier for middle class or wealthy individuals, for example, wealthy landowners who have large farms and therefore proportionally benefit more from fertilizer to access this. This is especially true because it costs a shit ton of money to enter parts of the country that are especially poor and because of limited government capacity, spending is mostly restricted to relatively wealthy areas. For those reasons then, I think that likely comparativism we restrict, we trim the fat while maintaining the systems that are necessary for growth. The second clash I want to talk about is just comparing both sides' methods of controlling debt. Because OG's method is basically to describe expansionary economic policy to us for seven minutes. Their case is literally given that we have more money, one, we get trickled down economics, two, therefore investors like to give you money, and three, that you end up being able to pay your debt QED. All I need to do is challenge the first premise that you therefore have more money and that this actually ends up stimulating the economy and leading to constructive growth. Four responses to this. One, the money that you give to the IMF is more effective on orders to the house than on dears to the house when we have restrictions and conditions on county users, especially when we do things like maximize, like make sure you have certain currency reserves and making sure that your currency remains stable in value. And the reason for this is because on dears to the house, a lot of this money is going towards debt servicing in the first place as opposed to going down to people. But the second main response for this is that the investor, it's not true that this is going to increase investors' investment in the long investment. Because in the kind of economic climate that we have at the moment in which there's high risk and investors don't have a shit ton of money to throw around, they're relatively risk averse, which means that they don't want to spend money on a country that might be able to take this money and succeed. They want to guarantee that there's shit shows that are happening time and time again in which countries have taken IMF bailouts and burned them on politically capital, but ultimately unsuccessful programs. And that we are the side that is able to get this reassurance. The third reason for this, though, is that this money goes primarily to elites, and I don't think that trickle-down economics really, really works. And the reason for this is like all the stuff that we've learned in Gecko 100, right? That is, trickle-down economics presupposes that elites actually are reinvesting the money that they receive, or when they earn money that this leads to more jobs. The issue, though, is that oftentimes elites would prefer to hoard the money themselves. And this is especially true in this kind of economic context in which there is a lot of uncertainty, and we do live in a country where institutions aren't as strong as you'd like. That's why China has a huge capital flight, because everyone wants to make money from business and then fuck off. Before I'm going further, CG.\n\n> POI: Just so we're all clear, perhaps, what is the purpose of large international currency reserves?\n\nIn order to make sure their currency remains stable and you're able to continuously pay off debt. Okay, the fourth response then I have is that it's also the case that even if you're able to achieve greater economic income, that this does not translate to ability to pay tax, pay debt, because it is very, very difficult for these countries to collect tax. Because oftentimes they have very, very small tax, narrow tax basis because of high inequality. Which means that in order to make money from economic growth, they would have to impose very, very high taxes on these particular groups of people. Which is A, politically unpopular, but B, also counterproductive with their goals of stimulating economic growth. All of this is to say is that one, they don't trigger economic growth, but two, even if they do, this does not actually mean that you end up resolving the debt crisis. Let me deal with that then, because it's actually not very clear whether OG cares about reducing debt at all. Their best case and their goal seems to be just continue the status quo in perpetuity. However, this is deeply unsustainable because one, clearly you do need money, but number two, it's the case that in their best case scenario, they're able to prevent some economic slowdown right now. However, in the long term, they keep on accumulating debt. I think it's way, way worse when the government cuts spending programs because they have literally no money and cannot choose what to borrow or what not to borrow. Or when you have a massive increase in inflation overall and then your money becomes completely devalued, then the ability of your country to be selective about who you pick up money to and who you don't. For those reasons, vote OO.\n"

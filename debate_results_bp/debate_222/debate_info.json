                "content": "People matter. People from all walks of life need to believe that all of this has meaning, that they are here for a reason, that their experience has achieved something, and that they are valid. Well, that's what we support on side-opening government with these religions that tell people to center themselves rather than to read. Three points of setup before moving Firstly, we think centering the self is not about selfishness at the expense of others, because obviously when you believe that all individuals have meaning, when they are all capable of forming relationships with God or gods or whatever so-called spirituality they believe in, you obviously have to believe that other people's experiences are also valid and important, is not something that you can actively reject and undermine. Secondly, we think the number of people in each world who are religious is likely to be fairly symmetric because of other pressures like cultural norms, like religious expectations. We think this is a debate mostly about the quality of religion rather than sort of the quantity of belief. But thirdly, we think the metric for this debate is that we think religion is broadly a pretty good force for a lot of people's lives, it helps people get a lot better. We think that is what we're defending. Otherwise, I will make three arguments. Firstly, why religions that tell you to center yourself are far more accessible and far more easy to opt into for a huge number of people. Secondly, why when people do opt in, their internal emotional resonance and experience of spirituality is far better in our world. Thirdly, it's harder to weaponize religion until you center yourself by bad actions. And we think the metric here is basically that people often form incredibly meaningful connections based on their spirituality with the world around them, often in times when they have very little else, when they perhaps live in poverty. We think it is good to give people the option and the easy access to religions that are broadly speaking pretty good. Four main reasons as to why we think we get better accessibility are as follows. Firstly, every single person around the world, no matter what circumstances they live in, has subjective experiences that they can draw meaning from. Not everybody can align with objective doctrine. For instance, if the Bible is pretty explicit that if you are gay, that is something that you cannot opt into, and that's the fashion, that is obviously pretty bad. But everybody has experiences of the subjective. Everybody has different beliefs about what is sacred, what is meaningful, what brings them closer to God or the gods or whatever equivalent spirituality they believe in. Every single person, by default, has access. That is something that the opposition bench can never claim, because inherently you have to believe that you serve some greater purpose in some more specific controlled fashion. That is far harder to access for the vast majority of people, particularly people, for instance, who don't align with traditional sort of gender nor cultural norms. That is something that is quite bad. And I want to pre-empt here that some opposition teams, well, it gives people a sense of a greater purpose, and that is quite meaningful, particularly for people who don't have a lot going for them in this life. But we say that it's especially important to make it as accessible as possible for people to believe in religions. Even if they don't necessarily have the best material conditions, it is still meaningful to give them a more spiritual and more deep and meaningful connection there. We don't think they necessarily need to believe that there is a better life for them when this religion provides them happiness in the immediate. The second reason for why is that there is simply a broader range of beliefs that are acceptable, because there is no concrete correct way to believe. There is no one there to tell you what you're experiencing is invalid. You are not actually a true believer in this religion. That is obviously really good, because it is much harder to be challenged, for instance, on the basis of whether you are a true believer. It is harder for people to attack what is often a very core facet of your identity, which is incredibly emotionally devastating. Thirdly, this religion just has a better image to people who aren't already believers, right? Because when the religion inherently believes that people matter and people's values and experiences are important, rather than outright rejecting them, that means it is perceived as a less cruel and cold and callous religion. You're far less prone to, you know, get rejected when people try to opt into it. You're far more likely to be interested and at least open to hearing some of the ideas of that religion, which can enrich people's life and experience meaningfully. But fourthly, it's just less miserable, right? If you're constantly worn down by the expectation that you should be sacrificing because your individuality doesn't matter, because there is no value in the self, you know, that is just an incredibly oppressive lifestyle to live. I know that's particularly bad for people who can't really opt out of religion because of things like familial expectations and cultural norms. If your religion is actively making you miserable by telling you that you as an individual do not matter, we think that is particularly bad. That is likely to lead to people to feeling hopeless, to feeling depressed, to feeling lost. That is the biggest difference in this debate. We make religion far more easy to opt into. We make it far less miserable once people are in there. We're moving on to the second point. Closing.\n\n> POI: Do you support religions or do you think religions are a bad thing? Which of the two is it?\n\nAs I pretty clearly state and set up, we support religions. We would just support religions being better than, you know, oppressive, you know, suffocating religions. I don't think that's a particularly effective way of life. Second substantive argument on internal emotional resonance and why people believe in more meaningful ways. Three reasons for this. Firstly, they are validated for what they have been through in their own personal life and that means that people from all walks of life are able to opt into religion. They're able to come to a more sensitive and more deep and meaningful and nuanced engagement with their spirituality. That looks like, for instance, being a, you know, for example, a gay Muslim and being able to believe that this offers you some unique sort of spiritual connection to your particular religious beliefs. That is something that is exclusively available on the government. Secondly, it doesn't deny people their suffering by telling them that it doesn't matter. And it's incredibly, I think it's just incredibly harmful for people to have their problems trivialized and telling them that not only is your suffering something that you simply have to endure, but something that is actively justified because, you know, you'll be rewarded in the next life, for example, or because it doesn't matter at all. Obviously that is incredibly demeaning and demands a huge sacrifice and burden from people that we just think has no real payoff or benefit for them. We think it is obviously pretty bad to tell people that when they live a life of misery, that they actively deserve it. We obviously, we can remove that from people's individual experiences ascent and consider it important. Thirdly, we just think it's a more empowering narrative because it suggests that you have agency over your own life, your connections, the way that you opt into religion matter. You are in control of your own destiny rather than, you know, subject to the, you know, the whims of a cruel universe. That is something that is incredibly empowering that makes people feel far less miserable about their life. That is why people's internal emotional resonance and the way they are spiritual is far better in our world. Finally, let's talk about this is why a world in which religion says the self is better, is harder for people, bad actors to weaponize. We think the counterfactual here, as I've already sort of implicitly alluded to, is that there's a focus on sort of, you know, maybe there's meaning in the next life or there's some greater purpose for you as an individual and yourself in your own experiences matter very little. But the problem with that, the problem with that is that that great, even though it's like the opposition to in this debate argue, well, that greater purpose is meaningful. I can't control how that greater purpose is decided and how it's manifested. We say it is determined by the religious powers that be that are often fairly heavily included with things like society and politics in ways that are quite harmful for two reasons. Firstly, as I already flagged, it's often politically intertwined. If religion is used to motivate and rally voters, it's used to justify conflict. For instance, look at the religious narratives between, for example, the conflict between Iran and Israel. Obviously, it is incredibly bad when centralized actors are able to take control of this narrative of what spirituality actually means. They're able to weaponize it to make people more violent, more hostile, more willing to reject other religions and say they are wrong. But secondly, we just think inherently othering narratives saying that if you, you know, individuals and their own interpretations do not matter, it's easier to say, well, if individuals don't matter, then their interpretation is wrong and therefore they are lesser than people, they are less than me. That means it's far easier to other them and make them the enemy. At the end of this speech, it's pretty clear. People matter. We should make them happy. We should make them believe that they matter. That is why we propose.\n"

                "content": "Firstly, OG rather is out because this motion is not this house regrets organized religion. Wouldn't it be great if everyone could believe whatever they want? And then like, everyone will go to heaven. Everyone will think that it's okay to be gay. And that's great. Christianity is something government defends because Christianity tells you you matter. Your choices matter. They will determine what happens to you in the eye. And we as Christians are very interested in what gets on. We defend things like Buddhism, where everyone is part of this whole wheel. And everyone, my knowledge of Buddhism is slightly rudimentary. So apologies if I misrendered it. Everyone is less important. What happens to you is of less importance than in general of removing suffering, of you just having the right way of life, but there's much less pressure to conform to that. I think this undercuts the vast majority of the material they want to talk about under their side of the house. First question, under which side do people feel better on this question about whether or not you can have your subjective experiences be good? The info slide says your experiences are special, but special just means of special importance and not necessarily good or bad, right? It is important that you get the correct, like you have the correct experiences in order for you to be saved in order for you to go to heaven. But for that to be a thing that you spend a lot of life worrying about, it must be the case that you could not go to heaven. Otherwise no one actually pays a lot of attention to this question, which means that for some people, it must be possible for them not to go to heaven. That is why religion still has a large amount of power to prescribe what is the correct way of living. What is the optimal special experience with God under their side, which means that I don't think they get access for the benefits they want to talk about. By contrast, I think we get some more level of inclusion under our side when it is less important, right? Because it could still be the case that we deem the thing that I participate in to be an evil under our side, because there still can be a prescriptive view of what is good or bad for the world, even if it's not good or bad to me. The extent to which I personally feel like I am a bad person, because the thing that I do directly ties to consideration of what I'm like, whether or not I will go to heaven or hell is much weaker. So individual sins are much less likely to make people question whether or not they actually fit within the religion. So people who differ slightly are much, much more likely to be able to access belief and much harder to discriminate under our side of the house. Secondly, why do we like religion? We like religion because it makes people happy primarily, and it makes an awful lot of people happy. I think there are two reasons that it can make people happy. Firstly, a sense of community, which is probably symmetric or something we will win under our side, because you're more likely to care about your neighbors, believe they're important, rather than to be particularly selfish, like spying on them and check whether or not they conform to the priest's instructions. But secondly, and relevantly, is it as a way of making you feel better when things otherwise are going badly. Because religion sure can be like an extra cherry on top if I'm happy, but it's much more important to make me believe my life's all right, everything will be fine when I really am in tough circumstances. Here's the problem with opening government. It is not clear why being told my suffering now is special will make me believe it, right? You could tell me that like the fact that I broke my foot is actually a wonderful thing for me. I don't fucking believe you. I can walk for several months. It sucks. So I'm not sure they actually get solvency. Why do we think comparatively it is much easier to believe that this is of less importance than to believe this is something that is actively good, which is something they're committed to under their side of the house, because like the way the world is, is special. And often because we try and prioritize the narrative that you need to achieve going to heaven as a thing, often these things get framed as tests or things you should actually celebrate in your life, because that is how you're going to prove you're going to go to heaven. That's, for instance, what happens a lot in Abrahamic religions. Firstly, it is easier because that is the way people currently behave. When bad things happen to me, my predisposition is to try and avoid those things, not to think about these things, but there is a real psychological limit to your ability to gaslight yourself into believing that pain or hunger is the thing that is actively good for you. So we actually have a narrative which coincides with the way that people generally tend to overcome these things. Sure, it might be avoiding the problem. We don't really care, given often, and we'll talk about this later, the thing that they tell you to do on Gov is not solve this circumstance, go see a doctor, but rather you just live with this and keep praying because that's what God told you to do. But secondly, because when there's a correct way to deal with this, that's just an additional layer of stress that makes people even more unhappy, right? When you're poor, you're worried, is this some sign that God does not particularly love me? Rather than believing this is just some symptom of a global system where individual behaviors are very unlikely to cause it, so people feel better. Secondly, religions are substantially less oppressive and are much more likely to actually appeal to poor people. Government might say, although they haven't so far, that when you're told that your individual circumstances do matter, the fact that you are in poverty is much more of an immediate harm and you're likely to see it as a religious harm. But we think this is not the likely way that these things are going to go because religions tend to like the status quo to an immense amount. Firstly, because when people are poor, they're much more likely to believe in gods for the reason I told you, that religion is less important to yourself at the point where you're happy. Secondly, because the most powerful religions, the ones that have the most impact, are usually the ones that have large amounts of state support and therefore are set up in order to preserve the state. But thirdly, because religious leaders are often able to make themselves wealthy because they're local celebrities, a lot of power over people, which means that they like the fact they are able to extract money from poor people. I'll take closing.\n\n> POI: Yeah, in Buddhism, people often say that if you do bad things, you're going to be reincarnated as a cockroach. Why does that not similarly scare people into behaving?\n\nLike, to the extent that that might be true, that there is a reason why Buddhism conforms to the government side. So maybe Buddhism is not the best example of an opposition religion, but we would say that if it did not tell you that fact, if it just said we care about other people, we care about the world, that would actually be preferable. I don't get this POI. To be clear, this suggests that when religions say your experiences matter, they are more likely to tell you that these things are actually good than tell you they are actually bad. So the religion under their side will not be an organizing force for making people's real conditions better. For sure, it is not the case that we are any better, right? It is still the case that organizations in our religions are still going to have incentives to support hierarchical structures and hierarchical societies, but people are still going to be intrinsically selfish under both sides. Religion never has so much power over people, and I think it's something both top half teams have conceded, that you're going to believe it's okay for you to be poor, it's okay for you to be hungry. The difference is that when you particularly are worried about what will happen to you and very concerned about that, your ability to be threatened by the religion to say, God will abandon you if you behave a certain way, God will send you to hell if you behave a certain way, forces people to conform to the status quo, which means that they are less likely to improve their own selves, to do what they perceive to be the most important thing, to improve their own lives under our side of the house. What are the impacts of these arguments? Firstly, people probably do things to improve their own lives, often things like advocating for better circumstances. They are happier under our side because they're less likely to see the conflicts between their own intuitions and their religion. But secondly, it's less easy to pressure people to things like frivolous donations that in many cases just constitute taxes on poor people that are wealthy. Hire up people very wealthy because it's much harder to persuade someone if you can't tell them they're going to go to hell to part with large sums of their cash. But thirdly, people are much more likely to push for change. This probably moderates the religion because if people don't believe them and you can't enforce going to hell as a way to force them to believe you, you're now much more likely to become more moderate, to push for or support poor people in your advocacy so that they keep coming back to your church. In the long run, this means that you're more likely to get some minor reforms in government, you're more likely to have wealth redistribution, you're less likely to have regressive taxation. Very proud to oppose.\n"

                "content": "For poor minority communities, when they face substantial suffering and misery, the far more accessible narrative is not to try and convince those people that there's some greater purpose here, that you know, your life isn't that important. There's something bigger out there that you're kind of missing the picture of. It is the far more resonant narrative, which is to say, no, your personal experience does really matter. To tell each and every individual that despite their suffering, despite their misery, their experiences are no less important and no less meaningful to their connection to God than anyone else's experiences. Side opening opposition seems to think that if you are poor, and like, are suffering, what this does is gaslight you to think life is okay. No, what it does is allows you to focus on what actually makes you or gives you meaning in life, whether that is your incredibly close relationship to your child, whether you look back at your friendships and your post romantic relationship, and think to yourself how much meaning and how much hope that gives you in that life, whether that is your conscience and your morality, thinking to yourself that you gave what little you had to try and give your children the best life they possibly could have. By opening opposition's own mechanism in the state, that individuals fixate on what gives them hope, what gives them meaning, that is why they will always turn to the positive personal experiences that each and every individual has, regardless of how much suffering they face in the world, that is what they will look at and say, this is what makes me a religious and pious person, this is what gives me my connection to God, this is why I still continue to live this life, despite that suffering, that is why always biggest harm in the state of, oh, we gaslight people into suffering and being okay with that suffering is clearly outrageous. What else does someone give up? Firstly, they explain that religions are going to be prescriptive under both sides of the world, congratulations opening opposition, that is why we gave the argument that it is easier to weaponize, it is easier to create societal narratives when they are religions that do not focus on the individual experience, and instead say there is some greater good or some greater meaning out there that individual experience doesn't matter. Why is that true? They give the example of Buddhism, which is a slam-dunk-for-side opening government, because it is Buddhism that asks the greatest sacrifices upon individuals, it tells monks that they need to rigorously follow hundreds of rules and you need to follow across your life you ever want to achieve a meaningful reincarnation. It is one of the most dogmatic religions in saying that you have a certain right way of conducting that life, that there are certain better and more objectively correct metrics that individuals ought to be following. If you do not, then you are a less pious person. We say that it is explicitly Buddhism, that is not the happy individualist kind of narrative that side opening opposition seems to think it is, it is one of the most brutal religions being incredibly fervently dogmatic. Look at examples like Tibet or Sri Lanka, we say it is actually Christianity. If you want to use that example, that is the prime example of a religion that is far more tolerant. There is a reason why there are so many denominations of Christianity, there is a reason why there are so many totally inconsistent narratives that Christianity has under its broad church, that is because Catholicism and Christianity are religions that obviously still have a hierarchical nature and still are organised religions. Well done. They are far more individual though, they therefore have far more tolerance to allow individuals to be able to access personal narratives. The big mechanism they do not respond to from the prime minister is one where it is far easier to politically weaponise, far easier to say that it is okay to sacrifice certain individuals for some other good, some other religious purpose in life. That is one that directly often explicitly targets minorities by telling those minorities that they are specifically not making the right decision and not making the sets of sacrifices that they ought to be, but explicitly it is one that is so much easier to weaponise, particularly by local religious leaders that are seeking further publicity, seeking further funding, seeking further power within their religious organisations. They are often the most fervent in utilising the fact of their control of what is that greater purpose to make individuals sacrifice more. We say that ESL is incapable. I'll take a closing.\n\n> POI: So, I may be ESL and an idiot, but please explain to me your mechanism of coercion. Why on your side of the house somehow magically you have more coercive power than tangible material consequences and impacts? Please clear it out for me.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what this POI is driving at, but to be honest, it's just like personal experiences exist to people. Presumably religion has incentives to include as many people as possible because that is how it gains influence and power in society. To the extent that there are a broad church of personal experiences that individuals have, that the church is more willing to give leniency of which personal experiences give individuals hope, which personal experiences make that meaningful connection to God, then some greater narrative which needs to objectively be tied to some metric that all individuals can follow. Otherwise, their sense of personal self-sacrifice doesn't matter. What else does side of the opposition tell us? They tell us that God will be more punitive, that there are greater power for external pressures, but we've already explained why the opposite is true. Why it's harder to coerce individuals who believe that their connection to God is purely personal or at least somewhat personal. He's less capable of influencing or shifting them to tell them that their relationship doesn't matter. But secondly, opening opposition says, look, what happens here is it's easier to moderate these religions. It's easier to hold them to account, but the opposite is true because your religion by necessity needs to tell individuals, it needs to be extreme enough to tell individuals that their individual life does not matter, that there is something greater outside of that religion. This is one by default that lacks moderating capacity of saying that individual experience matters, whereas ours is not true. Ours can say that both individual experiences and some greater sense of purpose does also matter. And it is deeply unclear, therefore, that ours is not far more capable of moderating that force of saying, yes, personal experiences matter and you should focus on the personal experiences that help others that are less selfish and are more inclined to, for instance, build on your family connection. Finally, what else can we give in this way? First, I want to explain that the opposition also has a capacity problem because they never really explain why, for instance, the most privileged people are just not the most capable of achieving whatever greater purpose or whatever sacrifice that they want from individuals. It is always the wealthiest individuals. It's always the individuals with the greatest social status and the greatest political power that are the most capable of claiming the narrative. We are being the most selfless. We are being the most capable of accessing this greater purpose. That simply means that the people who are the poorest, who suffer the most, the least capable of claiming that narrative of, I did this self-sacrifice to achieve something pretty good. We told you at the end of this day, we have a closer, more genuine connection to God and we have more individuals that are part of that community that share your emotions and your suffering. That is why we clearly take this.\n"

                "debater_name": "OO",
                "content": "I'm going to break this debate down into two very intuitive themes. The first is internally, does it make people happier or sadder? And the second is, how does it change their actions to make other people happier or sadder? So first on happiness, right? Our claim is that it's way, way in my search, conceive of yourself as an insignificant speck of dust floating in a beautiful universe that you feel like you have one life and have to prove yourself and do God proud in order to make it good. And the first instance that we give you is that in times of great difficulty, being told that religion is all about the self is incredibly harmful. I think she has a reasonable line here, which is to characterize self-centered religion as being very, very validating and self-selecting and that you can self-select into like the kinds of narratives that you prefer. And no one can tell you what to do because you're independent, right? I think that the main response to this is that unfortunately this debate doesn't happen in a vacuum. Fundamentally, human beings are social animals and religion itself is also highly communal. What that means is that connection to God exists on a scale and there are comparisons to one another. Perhaps because there are Bible study discussion groups in which you talk about what you've personally done to make yourself closer to God and note crucially like independent of religion, human beings are competitive. We want to be out for performing each other. We want the approval of our priests. And for those reasons, you have the constant pressure to perform. But second of all, it's also just the case that you can't non-align and lionize people who have done very, very well, which means that you are enshrining certain traits, certain traits, such as being a very faithful and obedient and passive wife, for example, or if you're a self-sacrificing man, you can make his country proud. All of these things tend to favor power, favor the establishment and make you much worse off and form the minorities O.G. wants to talk about. However, I do think that there is a claim on CG potentially that is better, which is that, you know, in times of difficulty, you can benefit from individual connections to God because you gain support and the strength that you need because you feel inspired and that you can push this difficulty and gain more from it. I think that even though that sounds good, it's inherently actually extremely harmful. The reason for this is because it makes your happiness and your comfort on being able to get something out of it or on feeling strong and on feeling able to push through these things. And the problem with that is twofold. The first is you often can't access the kind of underdog stories or the arcs that are nice and justifiable. And the problem is when you're going through really, really difficult shit, you form expectations of what you want to achieve. You think, OK, God has cost me a God. I've lost my wife. I've lost my children. But that's a test from God. It's because I was a bad man in these ways and I can still get them back if I do ABCD other things. And the reason for this is because people aren't perfect machines. Oftentimes, we interpret religious narratives through the context of our own lives, which is what this debate does. And that means our own hopes and preferences get imposed onto the way religion behaves. So we assume that that's sort of things that God wants. But ultimately, these are outside of our control. Economic circumstances are obviously independent of us. There are some random chances of fate that mean that we could lose certain things, like we could just be wrong. All of these things, life goes very, very badly for most people and experience a good deal of suffering. But the second main thing here is that I also think the feeling of strength and having God with you is really inaccessible. And I think that this also beats Uji's claim on bringing more people into religion. Because I actually think being like, I can benefit from a personal connection to God is really, really, really difficult when you're not actually raised to be religious as a child, because you're told like there is this God out there and then you can benefit from a connection. Like, what is this connection? I don't feel it. I don't see it. Whereas on the comparative, I actually think that self-rejecting religions are way easier to access. The reason for this is, what do most of these religions look like in the status quo? Oftentimes, they center around nature. They look at underlying rules about the world. And the reason for this is because the natural foil to being centered around the self is giving up the self and breathing and being, trying to let your consciousness fade into the universe. And that's pretty beneficial for two reasons. The first thing is, I think that the world around us is quite beautiful. And it is possible to just walk outside the door and see a tree that is beautiful and green and gain happiness from that. But the second main reason is crucially, it's especially effective in times of pain and difficulty. Because literally, like, these religions impose exercises, such as meditation exercises, let your mind expand, letting go of yourself. That literally reduces your anxiety, stress, and depression over time. And I think that that differs from processes of talking about guilt, for example, and confession, which rather reinforces your sense of self and makes your guilt even worse. Crucially, note that when individuality is the crux of the debate, it's very easy for their sides to tell you, you ought to do A, B, C, D things because these are in your own interest. On the other hand, when the sense of self doesn't matter, but crucially, when they're also much, it's also much more difficult for religious leaders to also assert themselves as positions of authority, because they are individual human beings, some people who are fallible, and who really don't mean anything in the grand scheme of things. I think it's significantly easier for us to resist oppression. I think that this is the most important impact in the debate. And the reason for this is because I really think that actions and things are often outside of our control. Like, yes, one person hurting me is quite bad, but people could hurt me or help me for a billion other reasons. Honestly, happiness fundamentally is governed by my own state of mind and how I interpret things as good and as bad. And for those reasons, having this mentality of low stress and being at one with the world is much more important. Before I go any further, I'll take CG.\n\n> POI: Yeah, so in reality, on both sides, people kind of know that life is quite a lot about luck. Don't you think that these factors will be worked in, in the way in which religion consoles on our side?\n\nSadly, I don't think that's the case. The reason for this is because religion is often about being up there being a higher power, right? So like, luck doesn't exist a lot of the time on Gov, because the idea is that like, things happen for a reason. And what has made this happen? Sure, maybe there are similar conceptions of fate on up, but it's the idea that things have happened for a reason, but this has nothing to do with me, because I am but an insignificant ant. And I think that for those reasons, it's much better for like notions of fate to be detached from your sense of self and what's happening around you. Okay, finally, then on actions to others, right? So we told you like to be told that you're matter very, very much intrinsically means that we tell people selfishness is good. And the reason for this is because yes, everyone is important, but people are subjective. I don't have epistemic access to Greg's happiness and harms, and he doesn't have access to mine. So oftentimes, we get overwhelmed by our own pain and suffering, and I'm trying to prove that at all costs. The problem with this is that different people have different levels of power and ability to make themselves better or worse off, which means that if everyone is trying to do what they perceive as the right thing, at the cost of other people, you end up reinforcing social hierarchies and making those with the capacity to do so even more powerful. To be clear, this has driven a lot of harm and suffering in the past, because when people disagree, you need to harm you do the suffering, and you justify that by saying, I'm doing what God wants me to do, or I'm making this person better off. For all those reasons, nature is great, people suck, happy to oppose.\n"

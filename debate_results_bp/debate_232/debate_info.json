                "content": "The world of opening and closing opposition is a world where academia is seen exclusively as the domain of the left. And the consequence of that is that it has led to substantial opposition towards academia and has weakened its place in society. But more to that, it's also led to the right increasingly not relying on well-founded views, well-documented views, well-proven views. Because the source of those views and the source of the legitimacy of those views has been stripped away from them from politics. I'm going to do three things in this speech. Firstly, briefly on set-up. Secondly, on opposition to academia. And thirdly, on what this does to discourse and research. Firstly, on set-up. Three notes on set-up. Firstly, what does the status quo look like? We think the status quo looks like a dominance among academics, among curriculum, among students, and amongst the general output of universities. Which is to say, that dominance has permeated through all of universities. There aren't healthy pockets of conservatives. There aren't particular factions of conservatives that have sway, that have a voice. They don't have any capacity to push back against the leftist sway. Secondly, what does the counterfactual look like? We think the most probable counterfactual in this debate is a diverse and healthy mix of political views that exist. That is not only because it's very difficult to form a dominant majority from any other particular position, given that the helpful rise of leftism has been somewhat of an accident. But it's also because each of those groups has strong incentives to make sure that their voices are heard. So you would imagine that in a vacuum, the likely absence of dominant leftism leads to a mix of more healthy political views. We think it's extraordinarily unlikely to look like a dominance of right-wing views. But moreover, we also think that even if you believe it looks like a dominance of right-wing views, those right-wing views are unlikely to look like the most vivid, the most aggressive views. Why is that the case? Two reasons. Firstly, because we think the context of universities is not conducive to those views, because they have to be demonstrated to have some basis in reality, to have some proof behind them. And those views factually do not. Secondly, we also think that the context of differing political views all having to clash against one another typically weeds out the most extreme, the most radical views, which is why the most likely counterfactual, even the most favorable one for these guys, doesn't look like bigotry having its place in academia. But the third and final note I can set up there with me is that leftism and liberalism, much to many debaters' dismay, is not an a priori good in this debate. It's not assumed that leftism and liberalism is what we ought to be standing behind in this debate. And it's incumbent upon this opposition bench to explain to you that things like individualism, things like reasonable, sensible, progressive policy done through conservative lenses, doesn't have significant value and shouldn't be what we care about in this debate. Before I move on, closing.\n\n> POI: If the right-wing can moderate the most extreme versions of their own views, why couldn't the left-wing do it as well?\n\nThe left-wing doesn't do it in the status quo for the simple reason they have no incentive to moderate. When you have complete dominance, there's no reason to moderate behind. The only incentive is to keep proliferating views. But more to the point, the capacity to moderate is limited when those opposing views aren't brought to the fore like they would in our world. So, what does that mean? That means that this debate is primarily about why a healthy mix of political views on university campuses leads to benefits. Which leads me to my first point of constructive. Opposition to academia in the status quo. The reality is that the status quo is not one where everyone buys into academia. Both from a structural political level, but also on the ground with respect to how people view the research and the policy outcomes that come out of university. That is primarily because around 50% of the world views academia exclusively as the domain of left-wing elites. People they are fundamentally oppositional to. Let's explain why that's the case. The first reason is that there are a series of parties that have strong political objectives to delegitimize universities. That is the right-wing. Why is that the case? That's the case because when the left has dominance over universities, it means the output of those universities becomes threatening to the right. Either because it's producing more left-wing students that undermine their voter base. Or, to the point, it produces more left-wing policy outcomes which undermines the right. It's very hard to make a justification for why we ought not vote for climate change when all university academics say that we should vote for climate change policy. Unless you're able to say that universities are corrupt, left-wing, nonsense, high-falutin places that we should have paid no heed to. And that means powerful institutions like right-wing media run by Rupert Burden or right-wing politicians that dominate half of the political discourse across the world have strong incentives to constantly reduce the effectiveness of universities. And they have two tools to do so. The first of which is undermining it through discourse by suggesting that we ought not pay any heed to it. And the second of which is to directly, politically attack it. By defunding universities. By making it more difficult to access universities. By promoting alternate pathways through life and suggesting that universities ought not be something that we should engage with. And the consequence of that has been that around the world, despite attendance rising in universities, funding hasn't risen for universities. And universities have increasingly had less and less effect on the political domain. But secondly, we would suggest that even to the extent that you don't believe that structurally they're being politically harmed, the cultural buy-in for universities diminished significantly. Which means the research that's being produced from universities, people on the ground from the right, don't buy into it. They don't think we should pay any heed to it. They don't think it should be something that's considered in the first place. What are the two impacts of this? Firstly, research and well-founded opinions have significantly less sway in the opposition world. That's important because in this debate, irrespective of the political position of the ordinary intelligent voter, you would have to suggest that well-founded opinions, opinions that have been subject to the marketplace of ideas and the willing down to that which actually has impact on our society, should take precedence. Because the context to a side opposition is that even if you believe that the left is still informed by academia, the right increasingly isn't. And the right still is going to be in power 50% of the time. And we would prefer that that 50% of the time, they're basing their policies on things that we know will have the impacts that they want, that we know will have the impacts that are desirable in society. But secondly, we would suggest that there's harmfulness debate for universities to be funded less. We would suggest that there's an a priori good for people to be more educated, for development to increase, for globally, for us to have more capacity to do good through the mechanism of universities. That's only possible in a world where they're well-funded. Our world solves this problem by not only aligning the interests of all parts of the political sphere towards universities being funded and supported, given that they only stand to benefit now, but also by reducing the capacity to attack universities by suggesting that universities are no longer the left-wing domain. There's no rhetorical sway that they're able to thrust over the left now. Finally, and Dan will expand on this more in depth with me, what do we think the effect of research and discourse is? Notably, side opposition has to defend a world where political views are being formed in a non-critical echo chamber. Sure, the Marxists might criticize the Leninists, but that doesn't lead to an actually thoroughly reputed opinion. It's only in our world where research from all swathes of universities is able to be actually checked and actually balanced. Side government is the side that stands behind political views being formed in a coherent way rather than an absurd way, which is what side opposition has to stand behind. Thank you.\n"

                "content": "Acknowledging the structural injustice at the core of society is critical to rendering education as accessible and empowering to its students as possible. A couple of things in the speech. First, what is the alternative? Then reputation, then two constructive arguments. First, on why liberalism and progressivism is something that good and why that spreads to society. And second, on why the dominance of left and liberal views on campus has made it far more inclusive and far more accessible as a space. First of all, in terms of the alternative, the absence of these narratives requires increased conservative presence at the expense of liberals. And the reason is that information and access to more views and education, et cetera, often corresponds to adopting more and more left and liberal-leaning views because you've had access to more experiences and views and the different experiences of other people. So that means they actively have to suppress the hiring of quality and intelligent, left-leaning academics. That means more conservatives exist among administrationals, for example. We think this massively increases conflict and the degree to which administration fails to function for university means more white people getting hired, for example. These are all structural problems in the way that universities are set up in their world. That being said, let's do some reputation first. Their first claim is that this dominance looks complete and it is blanketed in the way that it exists. There are a couple of things to note. One, there is diversity within the left itself, that there are varying views and varying extents to which people are left-leaning. And you probably know this because there are probably differences in the types of people, no thank you, that meet on campus and the extent to which they are left-leaning. But also they claim that there is just not a minority of right-wing people is just untrue. It is alive. It does exist at Princeton, for example. We see it all the time. Finally, it is not conducive to these views. I just don't think that it is true that conservatives can't exist. The reason being, for example, even if you are very, very radical, it is very easy to produce something, get tenure, and then begin expressing your radical views, at the very worst case on our side. In terms of opposition to academia, this is just straight scapegoating from their side. It is not true that if it were the case that academia was less left-leaning, that the right-wing would no longer have an incentive because of the oil lobby, for example, to say that climate change isn't happening and we shouldn't suppress that industry. This is just one way that this is happening, but I still think that to the extent that the left is pushing for climate change activism within the Democratic Party, for example, that that impact still materializes. But even in a moderate world, their claim on Biden doesn't work, the reason being that polarization still exists in other spheres of society. So which material gets your attention, for example? Is it the right-wing or the left-wing academia that is expressed on Fox News, for example, and which is expressed on CNN? That suggests that this is just perhaps the diversity of academia being produced at their best, but that doesn't change the way in which those active chambers exist. First argument, no thanks, on why liberalism and progressivism is good. It is true that sometimes the campus left seems to go too far, but broadly we think they are positive. And the reason is, going too far is usually a mischaracterization. It is what Fox News says is happening on campus, but it isn't actually accurate. The reason being that it is usually a set of students that just agree on the way to solve an issue. But more than that, there is a diversity of left policies, which means that there is a moderating effect on campus in terms of the way that people express their views and the way in which that manifests and the extent of protest and student activism. Why then is progressivism good, responding to the criticism from government that we need to improve this? One, it recognizes structural injustice in society, which fundamentally does exist. Things like slavery, for example, the fact that society is deeply unjust and seeking to resolve this is something that is positive. But it is also important because these injustices exist in a way that is critical for universities, right? It recognizes the way that these injustices have affected access to education and to universities. It is important because recognizing those inequities means that you acknowledge that different people have varying degrees of access and that allows for people to realize their privilege and engage in that. Second, I think that the left and the way it exists on campus, no thank you, is self-critical. And the reason is the left-leaning policies and the way that discourse manifests on campus is often about targeting the extent to which privilege exists. People aren't defensive when being confronted with their privilege. The reason being, A, there is humility, but B, because people in positions of power at university become increasingly representative of minorities in a world where it is left-leaning, which means that the people that are telling you that you ought to be acknowledging your privilege are people that you fundamentally respect. That suggests that the types of discourse and academia that is produced on our side is just more representative and acknowledges structural injustice in society, which is important. Second, progressivism convinces society writ large, and this is important. We concede that, as they suggest, there might be some backlash, but broadly speaking, we think that the extent to which left-leaning dominance exists on campus has actually produced a positive trend toward the broader embrace of progressivism and the left. How does this happen? One, I think that increased scrutiny actually shifts the over to the window that exists when talking about campus. The reason being that media continues to report and identify the ways in which the left is protesting on campus, for example, or student activism that occurs. These things, even when they are on the broader, further end of the left spectrum, end up representing views and beginning to normalize them. People find them more and more normal as they go to university, and so these views that are already considered good are things that can slowly be accepted by society. But second, at home, students start talking with their parents. So can conservatism in the house, it means that people in your family, for example, become more sympathetic to these things, and that is better. I'll take closing.\n\n> POI: What are your reasons as to why you believe that on your side, for some reason, the right or conservative views will dominate?\n\nI didn't say that. I just said that they exist in campus and that it is bad. Okay, second argument on minorities. The dominance of left-liberal views on campus represents the rise of inclusion on campus. There are a couple of things to note here. First, I think that, broadly speaking, progressivism does target minorities in the types of rhetoric and policies that it promotes. So that is acknowledging societal injustice, for example. It is things like supporting affirmative action. These are things that are critically targeted at minorities that are left out of the majority and the injustice that exists in society. So that suggests, in and of itself, the types of views and the types of policies that are being supported by people on campus are inclusive to a greater degree. But second, I think that, structurally speaking, on average, minorities are more likely to be left-leaning than the average person. The reason being that experiences that they have faced, things like often coming from low-income backgrounds, for example, as a result of societal injustice, means that you are probably more willing and more accepting of things like broader welfare services. This implies two things, for example. One, it means that you get better affirmative action programs and other sets of redistributive policies. This is important because it proves that there are a diversity of perspectives and experiences that are represented in academia. So it is not just academia from the white person, for example, but it is from all sets of society and minorities as well. Second, it suggests that minorities existing in campus is the function or is what enabled dominance in the first place. It is that universities slowly began accepting more and more people of color and that that is why that dominance happened in the first place. So societal trend toward acceptance enabled the dominance of the left to occur in the first place. So regretting this narrative, so regretting their acceptance on campus and their inclusion in these spaces to begin with. On that basis, oppose.\n"

                "content": "I want to start by addressing opening opposition's justification for why progressivism is an a priori good. Because we explain, head prime minister, that if you are not convinced of this fact, then dominance is neither strategic for the reasons we explain, nor acceptable in the fact that it drowns out other perspectives and does not provide a healthy balance of perspectives. Their claim is that progressivism is better because it helps minorities, it helps other ranges of oppressed peoples. They claim that since progressivism is a result of diversity, in order to regret the dominance of that progressivism, we need to regret that diversity. But there are four problems with this argument. The first is that they fail to prove why dominance is necessary for people to be protected, for people to develop compassion, for people to develop empathy, for people to engage in other perspectives. And that also explains why their meta trick doesn't function correctly. Because you can still have a diverse campus without liberals or leftists dominating it. Plenty of minorities are conservative. Plenty of minorities are free to experience their own perspectives. And they do not provide real reason to think otherwise. The second problem is they don't explain why conservatism cannot help minorities as well. And we would point out that even if they give you a reason to think progressivism might be preferable to conservatism, the burden they need to meet is that conservatism is not helpful, it is not valuable, or it is so much worse that it is not worth representing on campus. And we explain to you that things like diversity can be valuable in markets. We explain to you that individualism can be a helpful way for oppressed people to raise themselves up, or to hold onto hope, or to organise their ambitions. For this team to explain to you that that level of diversity is not valuable ideologically, they need to do much more to explain that conservatism is not helpful. Thirdly, we point out that there is a diminishing return on dominance of left or liberal views. That is, at the point where the primary debate on campus is between Trotskyists and Leninists, it's unclear that any of that discourse is helpful. We explain to you, as Prime Minister, that in order for leftism to succeed, in order for liberals to be effective at achieving their political ends, they need to not be effective at defeating people more radical or more fringe than them, but effective at explaining to the average person why their views are valuable, why progressivism is helpful. And the current level of dominance does not endow anyone with those skills. There's a diminishing return there. But the final and most important thing I want to add here is that our case also explains to you why, even if you think progressivism is better than conservatism, so much so that it is not worth valuing something like ideological diversity, we not only make that progressivism more effective when campuses are more diverse, but we also make conservatism less toxic. I'm going to move on to the second part of my speech which addresses that, which is the effect on research and the effect on discourse when campuses are more diverse. There are two important mechanisms to note here. The first is that we provide a much broader marketplace of ideas on campuses, which is valuable in and of itself, before analyzing exactly how it works out. That is for three reasons. Firstly, it's for the reason that we force individuals to interrogate their views more closely, which is valuable because it helps them form more precise views, it helps them form well-informed views, it helps them engage more deeply with the arguments that they claim to make. Short question.\n\n> POI: Conservatism has been dominant in academia for the past 300 to 400 years. What makes you think that's suddenly going to go away under your side?\n\nUm, conservatism hasn't been valuable for the past 300 to 400 years. Society might have been more conservative, so from the current perspective, it looks like academia was dominated by conservatives, but that's not the same as what you're claiming. We give you reasons to think that a mix of views is a far more likely result, and in fact, the very analysis you're hoping it gives, which explains that campuses have got more diverse from an IGPOL perspective, explains why it's likely to be a mix of views. Secondly, we point out that individuals have to justify their views more in an environment where they're not supported by individuals who have the exact same views as them, and that's a valuable set of skills for individuals to be trained in as part of their education. You're less likely to be required to justify the premises of your ideas, i.e. why diversity is good, or why redistribution is fair, in an environment where those things aren't being challenged. And thirdly, we would just point out that the presence of conservative views can sometimes be valuable for individuals to engage in. That is, as we've talked about at length, notions of individualism, of personal ambition, can be helpful. But secondly, and on top of that, we point out that individuals are forced to communicate those ideas more effectively, and learn skills which are more relevant to them, even politically, going forward. That is, at the moment, university discourse is not at all reflective of what happens in society. Progressives are not tested in their ability to convince the median voter, they're tested in their ability to form a coalition between the Trotskyist on campus and the Leninist. And we point out it's far more valuable, even if we think that progressivism is the only important thing in this debate, to train people, you know, to engage in discourse and argument which is more relevant to society as a whole. Can people still hear me? Okay, that has three impacts in this debate. The first is that right-wing policy and discourse improves as well. That is, when conservatives have a place on campus, they are more likely to base more of their claims in research. That is, under their world, conservatives do not have a place in universities. They are not represented in research. It's hard for them to find factual basis for their claims. And that's what leads to extremism. That's what leads to misinformation. And we explain why those problems are much less likely to happen when they're represented on campus. Secondly, academia is more likely to have a pronounced impact on society. When people are, both students and researchers, are engaging in problems which are more reflective of society, you're more likely to get, like, an actual impact on society. Because people are seeing the views which are relevant to them debated and discussed, not just more fringe, left-wing, and liberal ones. And thirdly, we point out that simply the quality of your education is stronger in an environment where you are forced to engage with a greater degree, like a greater variety of views, and question the premises which you operate on. Even if you're convinced that conservatism is so harmful or so invaluable that it should not be represented on campus very much, we explain to you the reasons that it needs to be there for progressivism to flourish. Some additional rebuttal. The first claim they make to opening opposition base is opposition to climate change would exist anyway in response to the argument we give. But there are three problems with that. Firstly, we point out, no, not everything has a lobby behind it. For instance, research on something like racial disparity might be more likely to fall on people who are listening if there is no, like, kind of politicization. Secondly, we point out that you're less likely to have denialism in the first place, and conservatism isn't forced to completely ditch universities and ignore them, you know, wholesale, which is what we explained to Prime Minister. And finally, we point out the capacity to ditch universities, to characterize them as extremists, is much less in an environment where universities are not seen as the sole domain of leftism or liberalism. So even if the incentive exists, it's much less likely to happen. The only other meaningful claim they make is diversity within the left exists, and conservatives exist. Firstly, diversity within the left isn't always useful. They operate on the same premises. Second, conservatives are often marginalized, because the left tends to oppose trade-offs. And thirdly, we point out it's about perception. The thing we explained to you at Prime Minister is universities are marginalized when they're deceived to be dominated by the left and liberals. Even if they avoid that reality, that perception is still terminal for their case. For those reasons, we have to go.\n"

                "content": "Being misgendered or being forced to use a bathroom that doesn't match your gender identity ruins your day and makes it impossible for you to go to classes. It destroys your confidence and your quality of life. The reason why dominance is necessary is because pre-existing social structures crush minorities and make it impossible to access the privileges that university confers upon us. At today's university, 9% of the student body is Hispanic, despite them constituting 30% of the population of the surrounding city of New Orleans. At Princeton, the percentage of black students in the university sits below 15%, despite the fact that they make up about 30% of the population of New Jersey. The issue is, on their side, that there is no correction for the systemic class injustices that exist in society today. We are willing to trade off benefits to discourse or to academia, as long as right here, right now, formal students in universities are currently feeding a press who would, on their side, feel like they do not have a place in these halls of prestige, feel like they can have a home here, and as long as we can make sure that we increase social mobility by helping them access this. Three clashes in today's debate. The first thing I want to do is talk about the quality of discourse, because that's the majority of the advocacy from side 00. Their claim here is that it becomes impossible to challenge views because there's no challenge to your views. It then means that children do not learn how to justify their opinions, and this makes them less persuasive. Their analysis is not actually unique to universities, but rather to echo chambers in general, and I think that this idea that people all around have the same opinion is way more true and more a function of geographic and demographic functions than anything else. If I go to a school in Manhattan, for example, and I'm surrounded by other children who are from suburban neighborhoods with WASP parents, then it's the case that I will have some degrees from them because my parents will be the same gaze, because I've used the same social media, because I looked at the same influencers, or because I just experienced the same kind of economic circumstances and priorities in my life. The issue then is that they have people who come from this position of ideological gridlock already, and universities are way, way, way better for this for two reasons. One, because kids come from all sorts of different backgrounds and disagree on issues intrinsically. It's absurd for them to say that liberalism is all exactly the same because they're just cherry-picking examples to say that liberalism is all about intellectual, and liberalism is all about theories. For example, Marxists and Leninists and Trotskyists. The average STEM kid does not know who Lenin is. They do not understand the difference between Marx, Lenin, and Trotsky. I think this is not the case. The priority that is placed by leftist universities is rather on issues of social justice and class and race. Before I go any further, I'll take a closing.\n\n> POI: Yeah, so far you've been talking about things that liberal judges like, like progressivism and stuff like that. Why don't you talk about the communist idea, socialist idea, and these type of things that are also propagated in universities that are dangerous for people?\n\nSo, the 20 seconds I had just said explain why liberalism in universities focuses on ideas of social justice as opposed to these intellectual ideas. The second thing I want to say, though, is that it's also misleading for them to say that conservatism is all about individualism and that this is mutually exclusive, the brand of leftism that exists on campus. Very simply because it is true that this appeals to people and they don't associate it with conservatism to such a large extent. So, as I was saying, people come from all walks of life and their upbringing and their religion and their parents influences their opinion more than the university does. Over the course of your time at school, you talk to each other and you come to a consensus to a large extent where you become persuaded on some issues. It's disingenuous for them to say that because people agree that you don't therefore diverge across your opinions, very simply because the point of education is to understand why the things you're doing are true. Like, if a professor just shoves CRT down your throat and tells you this is objective truth without explaining why, the class gets like three-star reviews and no one comes back again. People want to understand why. People want to understand the different objective, the different perspective, and this has just become a fundamental truth of academia and a fundamental of teaching in the classroom. So, for those reasons, I think that transferring liberalism from something that exists exclusively in social media among young people in wealthy communities to something that exists in academia means that discourse and justification is better, not worse. The second clash I have to talk about then is on polarization and social progress because they say that the harm is that there's a demonization of universities that de-legitimizes academia. So, I just want to call bullshit on this issue because the idea that people, that right-wingers all see universities as dens of corruption that are dominated by the left is incredibly extreme. First of all, because honestly, academics intrinsically have a ton of authority. Jordan Peterson is called a professor because everyone has a respect for academia. But second of all, it's also the case that this narrative runs counter to the majority of right-wingers, especially people in positions of influence. It might exist for some extremists, but the average person still perceives university as a source of prestige and social mobility. Like, you will know someone in your family who went to school, and that will be an achievement which you celebrate, not which you condemn because their income is higher afterwards. But also, the majority of politicians went to university. The impact of this, then, is that the narrative of rejection of liberalism in university does not look like a wholesale rejection of academia, but rather a claim that the rise of liberalism in universities is bad, and that there's, like, shit just being perpetuated by it. Therefore, there is no rejection of objective truth such as climate change is happening as a result of this trend, and the condemnation of universities as a perpetrator of harmful abuse is something that would exist on either side of the house. So, OO gets no offensive advocacy on the idea of polarisation. Finally, then, on why it's the case that dominance of liberal abuse is necessary for protecting students on campus, for two reasons. The first thing is, liberalism and progressivism, and making sure that people feel included, does not require 50% in order for things to pass. It requires an absolute majority because it requires you to change structures that already exist in school. And more aggressive affirmative action programs, for example, mean that awarded trustees or people who, like, analyse children, are less able to get into schools. You must be able to defeat their interests in order to achieve these action policies. But second of all, because it only takes 20% of the student body, or 40% more, in order to make someone feel unwelcome. For example, if it's the case that conservatives feel like it is just very, very easy to criticise someone for being transgender, then transgender kids cannot attend school. For these reasons, very happy to embrace liberalism.\n"

The Pro argument lacks specific evidence or reasoning to support its claim about conservative views being unable to push back against leftist sway.",

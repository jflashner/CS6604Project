                "content": "Okay, a few points of framing to start. First, I think it's probable that if intelligent life does exist, it's very, very far away from us. The reason for this is twofold. One, we've looked at a lot of nearby planets already and just kind of found nothing. So, we have things like the James Webb Space Telescope, which produces some pretty nice images of space that we can look at, and we found from looking at pretty much all of the nearby galaxies and star systems that most of the planets that could potentially host life just don't really exist around us. And so, I think it's very unlikely they're going to be anywhere near us. But it's also because there are very, very specific conditions that need to be met for life to exist, things like existing in a certain radius of a solar system close to a star so it's not too hot or not too cold, and that just means that again, a lot of candidate planets just aren't very close by to us and tend to be very far away. So, it's probably going to be far away. Importantly, this means we're not going to be able to ever really reach them, or if we do, it's probably not for a really, really, really long time, usually because it requires us to be able to do things like traveling faster than the speed of light. We're nowhere near achieving this at the moment, given that we don't know how to go faster, like anywhere near, like even 10% of the speed of light. Currently, we're probably not going to figure that out for quite a lot of years. I think chances are a planet is going to implode entirely before we actually get to that point because it probably requires us to, like, build some reactor that means that we blow everything off or something, or just like climate change happens and then things are going to go badly. But secondly, I think it's very probable that this life isn't that intelligent in the first place. So, intelligent life doesn't mean like they're brainiacs who know everything. Intelligent life means that they're just capable of possessing consciousness and they aren't like bacteria that are living on these planets. You know, elephants are pretty intelligent, but they're also not capable of having language. Therefore, I think it can be a lot of like deer existing on some planet that's very far away from us. I think, importantly, that this is very likely, right? Because presumably if there was super intelligent life that existed elsewhere in the universe, they probably have already figured out how to do things like space travel. They'd have already figured out how to obliterate our civilization already if that was something that they really wanted to do. I think the important implication of this is that if I want to run something about why this like means that aliens are going to come and obliterate the planet, it's probably not true. They probably would have done it already if this was the case, or we probably already be able to see them in our telescopes, evading other parts of the universe or being present elsewhere in the universe. Therefore, I don't think this is very likely to happen. So, the case we're going to bring you from opening government is very simple in terms of why this humbles humanity and why allows us to enter an age of enlightenment that is better for everyone. Because it's important to note, humans are often very self-absorbed and we see ourselves and our problems as being the center of the universe. We have a very self-privileged view of ourselves where we are the most intelligent life that exists on our planet and we're unaware of any other life that exists in the universe. Therefore, we think that we are the most intelligent life that exists in the universe. This very much feeds into a sense of self-exceptionalism for humanity where we think that we're the most intelligent beings and thus we have a right over everything that is around us. Consider how this makes humans behave, things like meaning that we treat other species around us with disregard because we think of ourselves as being more intelligent than them and therefore having a claim to their habitats, meaning we do things like abusing our environment or feeling like we have an inherent right to nature. But also, it drives harmful narratives of self-exceptionalism, again things like, for example, religion, which I think probably doesn't exist in a world where we know that there's intelligent life on other planets, given that most religious, with the exception of maybe Buddhism, most religious narratives often say that God created humanity in their own image, that God only really created the earth as a planet where life exists. Therefore, I think this fundamentally challenges a lot of those narratives and people probably aren't so willing to buy into religion anymore or they buy more into other religions which aren't so anthropocentric and are instead like believing in things like Buddhism instead, which is maybe something that is good. What happens on our side then when you suddenly understand that there are others out there? I think firstly, to know most people just don't really know what the degree of intelligence of these life are. Even if there are unlikely to be intelligent for the reasons that we've told you already in terms of like, you know, there aren't spaceships flying around all the time. So, they're probably not that intelligent. People don't know this and so there's often going to be a lot of speculation as to whether or not these other life-forms are as intelligent as us or are potentially more intelligent than us. I think the important thing is this shatters our sense of self-exceptionalism and it shatters our sense of feeling like we are the center of the universe and we are the center of everything that is important. It shows us that there is more than just earth out there. And I think that's important because it very much changes how humans value themselves in very positive ways. Think about the moral and philosophical discourse that would exist in the world when we understand this information, when we're having discussions about what the nature of life is and what the nature of life in the universe is in a public forum, in so far as this is something that enters the public consciousness. When this information is revealed, I think that means more people are forced to consider the inherent value of all life around them because when we discuss whether other life might be more intelligent than us and we challenge the conception that life is only valuable because we are the most intelligent people, then it means that people are forced to consider other things around them as having more inherent value. I think the important thing is that if that means that people are just nicer to our own environment, then that's something that is very positive because it means like lots of animals stop being slaughtered by humans or it means that we're more likely to do things like fighting climate change. Um, yeah, sure.\n\n> POI: Aren't you quite likely far more intuitively the value intelligent life? You believe it only exists on Earth, and if it's somehow space here. Why are you consider them to have the equal moral value as a human to get your impacts?\n\nNo, but like, again, people don't know that it's just space deer. It could be like really smart space deer. So, I think realistically that people just don't know. Like, there's nothing in this machine that tells you what the life is. It just tells you that the life exists in the first place. So, people can still value that, but also, I don't get why you're not gonna value intelligent life, given that humans are, like, as a whole, apparently quite intelligent. So, you probably still value your own life and you probably like are still going to value intelligent life, even if you know that it exists somewhere else in the universe. Like, no one's gonna be like, \"Humans are not important anymore because there is life elsewhere.\" I just think people are gonna be like, \"Humans aren't the smartest people ever anymore,\" and the difference then is that you treat other things with more respect because of it. I think also we have to consider things like the wave of inspiration that could arise because of this, because now you have people speculating as to what intelligent life might look like, and that means that you get a drive of things like media being produced that speculates us to this. Think about films like \"Star Wars\" that millions and millions of people around the world enjoy that were sparked by things like the space race happening in the 60s. I think in the very same way, we're likely to have people fantasizing about what this intelligent life might look like, and that means we get a lot of media produced that people really enjoy. Then, people are probably gonna be a lot happier in this world because of that. I think also, like, we really like Croatia, and maybe it's great that Croatia gets to announce this information because they can have a cool thing credited towards them, and that's another reason why we should probably like this quite a lot. But realistically, again, I think if this means that people reconsider harmful value systems, it often leads to people killing each other. Things like religion, where wars often start because people believe that, you know, they are the people who were created by God and are the most important people, and we're able to challenge those value systems on a very fundamental level, then if we get rid of harmful systems of belief, then I think we're much more likely to live in a peaceful world, in a world where people treat each other with respect. Thank you. OG.\n"

                "content": "Panel, Hobbs was wrong to differentiate from the state of nature. It is life, which is nasty, brutish, and short. Two points of framing at the top: characterization and then talking about the curse that is existence. Let's be clear here. This house here is being asked a moral question that we hope for all moral actors within the debate. What is good for them? The second clarification to who should we consider moral actors? We've already heard it's the idea of anyone who has choice, consciousness, rationality, and so on, but we say we should expand this. It's animals too, the idea that we cannot know that which is pertaining within the mental processes of other beings and epistemic access. But crucially then the idea that past that, you don't need to be certain. Therefore, we have to defer to outside things, ideas of do they exhibit choice or not? Which we see animals doing each and every day. Can they experience pain, which we know to be certain for all animals? These are the things which are certain. These are the things which we should base moral prescriptions on, not of uncertain things which we cannot know inside of other beings' heads. Crucially then the pre-characterization, we say due to the nature of the universe, if there are other life-forms, there has to be a multitude, a huge, huge scale of other life-forms. The reason for this is this thing called the Fermi paradox. Either it is the case that we have passed a point of destruction in the universe, we were the sole unique condition that exists even in an infinite area that was able to get past this point of destruction for all life-forms. We've already passed that point or it's not. If we know there's other life-forms, we know it's not. We know that that is a not a unique thing in and of itself and therefore the odds of other life-forms having it to expand exponentially more and more and more. What does this mean? It means, first of all, we are now non-unique. This is also crucial because it means it's probably very similar conditions. This isn't gonna be like space steer or Boltzmann brains. It's probably because if we pass this threshold, we probably did it in a way that's necessary to do. So therefore, the other existence in the universe is probably very similar to us and they've been way a lot of things. There's probably a package armor with no mustache doing this debate light years away, but crucially then past this, it means there's an insane scale here because there has to be so many different intelligent life-forms. Meaning it outweighs humanity in and of itself if it was more important for them and of them. Sorry, Edinburgh. What does this mean then? Because yes, while this means humanity kind of hope that like our world isn't gonna die, I do not care because this is not something you confronted with every day. Have we passed the Fermi paradox point? Who the fuck says that any normal day? Not me and I'm a debater. Crucially then when you say what is crucial is the idea that life is unavoidable. Life confronts you each and every day, the structure of it, the way it interacts with your brain, the way the pain that hits you all the time when you are beaten. This is something which is unavoidable. This is what this debate is about. What does that life look like then? We say it's a curse of existence. In fact, it curses because there's it's bound up with three of them. The first is the curse that comes with energy and the nature of energy within the universe. Because it's obvious that life requires energy inherently or else it could not do things. But secondly, larger beings, for the easiest way, especially if they're quite intelligent and therefore figure out this is an easier way, is to get energy from other beings. Crucially, for example, say plants get photosynthesis to bound of energy. But then smart animals go, \"Hey, we can eat you. Thanks for doing all the work.\" Thank you, then moreover, it scales up and up and up when you get more and more intelligent life. But moreover, this means food chains and evolution, the necessity of it and given that these are very similar beings to us. Means that there's a constant structure of oppression of animals across any of them, whether they be terrestrial or extraterrestrial. But moreover, we say this expands to all resources because it's what starts to what structures humans' brains via evolution. Which is in a second, but we say the very nature that this is the way we should pursue things. This is the way we should do things if it's easiest if we take energy and resources from other people and give it to ourselves. Means you get things like conflict within the real world, especially because energy is not necessarily limitless. And I given that they're probably quite similar to us and we haven't invented infinite energy yet, I'm not sure they can either. But crucially then it expands to other resources because it's a mental process. It looks like things in the current system of capital where people who work a bunch, other people then just get the rent from their work and have to do anything in it themselves. We say this is a mental process, which is likely to expand outwards. We say evolution has a curse in and of itself. Because that which has made to the top of the food chain, if intelligent life exists in of itself. We say there's certain conditions which means it's likely to do so. It's the fact that it never settles, it constantly to push more and more and more and therefore is not outcompeted by another organism. It's the fact that it deeply fears pain and therefore constantly insulates itself for making sure it does not die. Or else it wouldn't have made it past that point of destruction. I mentioned earlier. It is in these instances then that life is likely to exist. What does this mean? It means they constantly do not acclimatize. If you are happy in life, it's not enough because you need to get more and more and more. You acclimatize constantly to what that which was good is now the norm, you need to push further and further. It also means pain is very approximate. It's probably the most proximate emotion for these people. Sadness, depression, and all these things are things which are inavoidable because evolution forced us to have them so we could be alive. This is something which is necessary for all these intelligent beings, at least the ones which likely rise to the top. Crucially then so far, we've shown that there's like a conflict and which brings about pain, but also pain weighs very highly. Sure.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nThey can feel pain. You do not know that. They don't have sentience because drink again epistemic access. I've already explained all these things. You are being speculative and weighing up moral virtues based on that. I do not know you, so you deserve the moral value is a disgusting sentiment in and of itself, and it won't be need to start applying to animals and realize that we should not do so. Moreover, we say there is a con curse that is bound up with consciousness to the idea that bendy paper um. Crucially, intelligence means at least rationality, as per Jamie. What does this mean? It means you constantly have to ask yourself questions, and you're constantly bound with trying to figure out that which is in front of you now. One of the bottom of the food chain, these kinds of things. It's quite straightforward. I need food. I go get food. We say that still though has other things bound up with it, the idea that even at those instances when you are pain, you're saying why is there pain? Why are these things exist? There's inherent nihilism and constant skepticism that exists because of intelligence. Intelligence is bound up with skepticism in and of itself. Crucially, then we say that skepticism is likely to default in nihilism in all instances. So even if you want to try to overcome all these previous impacts through meaning, you're not able to do so. Things like religion is immaterial. And it's hard to then conceptualize that to the material. Everything in front of you is material. So if you're all this meaning in life because religion, how does that work if it's not connected to everything in front of me? If I'm told it's immaterial? I'm sure gonna control it, but that doesn't seem to make sense. That doubt, that skepticism. It's something which will always make you doubt the meaning, and unless the meaning is concrete, there's no way it can overcome all the previous curses. But crucially then, because you constantly doubt it, you begin to have no belief in it. You believe it causes you further oppression. So further depression, further nihilism expounds the material meanings to our fragile because you know meaning must be certain. But my loved one could die, my job could go. These are things which then seem to not rationally connect, and even if you could figure out where to do it, you will constantly doubt your own rationalization, the doubt that is bound up within rationality because that which it allows it to make choices is something which is inescapable panel. It's I know it's grim, but existence is quite inescapable. We must weigh all actors in this debate. We must not be sceptic. We must not resume things. We must not weigh ourselves as necessarily better than anyone else. Especially because that's what Prime Minister says is likely to happen. Crucially then, we say you should oppose. Thank you.\n"

                "content": "The universe right now is a black forest of uncertainty, a factor that fundamentally limits our ability to dream and hinders our imagination and creativity in ways that darken our perspectives and cloud our ability to access not just inspiration in our lives, but access new perspectives about our place and the information about why we exist and why we are here. I'd like to just quickly tackle what we got out of Opening Opposition. I like if the answer is no, it's like terrible for us. I think this suggests there is a very low probability life can exist in the universe. But I think the problem is this specifically is what fills people with existential fear. Do we hit a wall in our civilization coming to collapse? I think what this specifically means is that we activate Jamie's impacts at the point at which people are more scared. More scared of war, more scared of climate change, and they think it will end all of civilization. I think this is when people are forced to contradict their current philosophical positions on whether or not humanity holds a sacred place. And I think this is exactly when people become less self-centered and anthropocentric about the fact that we own nature. We own the earth and we own our universe. Why then does government win regardless of the results of the machine, something that I don't think our opposing bench has engaged with? If intelligent life does exist, accessing new and inspiring information about the universe we live in. We live it. I think noting that space is uniquely inspirational as a frontier of human progress here because of its sheer vastness. Because it contains information about factors that contradict our embedded philosophies. Look at how discoveries of like Kepler and Copernicus were reacted to and shook the Catholic Church and fundamentally altered its composition. People dream of space and material progress affects our ability to tap into this creatively. See the space-age boom in speculative fiction in people questioning their governments and what the future would look like. See how science fiction calls upon us to consider dystopias of far-off possibilities of what we might do to our own earth or how we may destroy our own environment. I think this is specifically relevant here because people react to new discoveries with enthusiasm, as Jamie has analyzed. Because people react in this way regardless of the results. Anyways, we didn't have to discover aliens during the space-age boom of the Cold War to make creative works about them. But we did need creative prompting from information that contains innate philosophical information about our galaxy. Yes, I think this is kind of an art debate. But also, why then will this information be non-threatening to most people for all of the reasons that Jamie tells you? I they're probably very far away and they're also probably not like particularly intelligent. The anthropic principle tells us that it probably just looks like space monkeys or something. But I think we still access all of our benefits, right? I think the discovery itself is magnified by the media that will be created about it. I think the discovery itself will prompt people to consider what else may lurk out there. I think people will be engaged when they discover that humans aren't the only intelligent life. Why then will reception of this information be quite good? I think it's fair to say we get some resistance to the information from some groups. I think this is innate to all kinds of progress, but no, firstly, I think non-agreement with this information is likely pretty neutral. I think people can choose not to engage if they don't want to. I think they will for all the reasons Jamie told you. I think secondly, even people with hostile philosophical positions with the idea that humanity occupies a higher place in the universe, well, they mean not, well, they may change their mind as Jamie said and has analyzed they often will and and this will be good. Regardless, for example, for religious people. But also note that if you are really unwilling to alter your perspective due to your entrenched interest in humanity's higher position, I think that people can hold contradicting philosophical positions sometimes in the case that their position is entrenched, like non-overlapping magisteria as the kids call it, because number one, they're already ardently religious people do things like stem degrees and research stem cells and engage with science. And while science is capable of changing your system of belief, I think it specifically is because you consider analytical ways of thinking and you develop critical thinking skills and literacy. We are not required to prove everybody changes their mind about this in order to inculcate new philosophical perspectives and get Jamie's benefit of lush selfish perspectives off humanity. But also means that we give people the information to make hard decisions themselves about their lives that are critical, like about religion, about spirituality, specifically as it relates to our values and our morality. But I also like to respond to the POI that Jamie received from our closing. Will humans be seen as having equal moral value to these creatures? I don't understand why this can't be an expansionary view of what is worth moral consideration. I eat like how the animal rights movement have expanded our dear our ideas of whether or not animals are worth moral value. I think we also just pose people additional questions about this. But I also don't think that this is exclusive in any way because we already dehumanize other human beings all of the time. This is just an additional mechanism by which we get people to question their entrenched perspectives. Why then is increased information good here the most important thing in the debate, which is regardless of Opening Oppositions impacts because this is about fundamental questions and things that hugely impact our rights and our ability to think. I cannot consent to being born into a universe where I don't know what happens after I die. I don't know why I'm here. I don't know if meaning is given or if it is something that I have to make for myself. I think this has a huge impact on people's individual lives, but also on society. I'll take Closing.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nI think, firstly, this just ignores all of Jamie's framing about how this is incredibly unrealistic and stupid. But I also think that if we have to prepare for an alien war, I would like to know in advance. I would like to be warned about that. I want to, like, make some cool spaceships and, like, some guns and stuff and do, like, Star Trek and everything. Okay. Specifically, then, people's individual lives are touched by the idea that they are the only people in the universe because this is a specific criteria by which many religions operate. It also just informs agnostic people whose moral values are based on the ideas that humans deserve inherent rights, but not necessarily encompassing the fact that we have obligations to nature and to other human beings, other sentient beings. But I think this hugely also impacts society because at the point at which we feel an obligation or ownership of our universe, specifically of our globe, I think this is when people are unable to question whether or not they actually need to look after the environment or safeguard nature or safeguard other animals. I think the fact that this gives people more information in the first place is prior to everything in this debate because it gives them more ability to get consent into both their ideological perspectives and their religious perspectives. It is not fair that I had to be born in this world, but at least people, the least thing people can do is give me more information to inform my perspectives and how I choose to act on that information, regardless of if I act in a good way or not. Thank you very much.\n"

                "content": "We are all trapped in a system of consumption, which necessitates the privation of resources at the expense of the weak. We are all trapped in an evolutionary process, which necessitates the proliferation of pain over pleasure. Universally, we are all trapped in an intellect, which seeks out reason and is denied it at every single turn. We would not wish this trap on others. We would not hope for a universe of pain. Opening government criticized the human proclivity towards anthropocentrism and yet their cases. Anthropocentrism embodied only caring in an infinite universe about the pain that exists on a small blue dot in the middle of nowhere, rather than the universal question of whether we should believe that a world that has other sentient beings in it is one that is preferable for those beings who have the capacity for pain and pleasure. So, the first question that I seek to address in this speech is the question of what we should hope for. I would propose two things here. The first thing is we should hope for a better world. Morally, it is the duty of the house to wish for that. Which is the most moral reason is the capacity we all share, and the instantiation of that reason in the world is an evaluative system of that world, which is to say a moral framework, a comparison of better worlds, which can indeed be retrospective. We would not hope to find out that a friend or a loved one had lost their parents many years ago, even if emotionally they had recovered. I would like to know that, like in general, if we ever debate about things like the environment, we don't just consider what would happen to humans, but to animals and smaller life forms within those contexts. Why should we not have this in our context of this debate? We never get an answer from proposition bench. Without that weighing, they cannot be winning the top half of this debate. The second thing I would propose is utilitarianism because you need to ask what constructs that framework by which we should evaluate the world. We were proposed that it should be that which creates the least total suffering is the best system. Consider this. Deontology, things like \"you should not ever lie,\" are fundamentally begging the question because they are based off of an assertive framework about a thing that is external to us as humans that we cannot have the capacity to perceive, and yet it's claims that we should base our intuitions off of those. Like those claims, even when they seem really unintuitive. That you should not lie is as true when someone asks you for your credit card details as it is when the axe murderer comes to your door asking what your mother is. Neither of those things should be the same, and therefore that is the wrong system. Utilitarianism, therefore, uniquely is valuable because it is based by a phenomenal instinct that we have contained within ourselves. I.e., the intuition that we universally share that pleasure is something that is morally good, that pain is something that is morally bad. I couldn't like putting pain on someone for no reason. It's something that we should abhor in all instances, but it's even better than that because it's not culturally defined. It's not relativistic. It's arithmetic, i.e., we can use mathematics and basic systems of addition and subtraction to decide which is the better world in a comparison of two worlds, and therefore that is the best thing we should do. Notably, it cannot be just net utility for two reasons. Firstly, each individual within that system of utility has a unique access to a perspective, which means that you cannot just be considering whether an individual's premise is the best one. But secondly, and more importantly, because this is an intuitive framework here, right? It is that it would lead you to what is called the absurd conclusion within philosophy, which is to say the idea that one person leading a really, really good life would be a better world than seven billion people leading a quite good life. We were proposed to you, therefore, that is the net amount of the total amount of suffering that exists within the universe. That is the most important framework by which we should evaluate this debate. We get no engagement on that from opening government, and therefore they cannot be winning absent a framework of why we should consider these things. To this, closing government say, \"aha, but animals have no sentience.\" I just don't think that that's true. I just don't think the average informed voter believes that it's true. I just don't think that your opening government said that it was true because they criticized the recidivism within humanity. They said that the world that we should be seeking out is the world which protects animals and the environment writ large because of that they cannot stand by that framework in response to us because animals have the capacity for pain and pleasure because the human-like existences that might be in that universe also contain the capacity for intellect, for reason, for those kinds of processes. Absent a justification from that from closing government, they cannot be winning this debate. Three things we told you in opening opposition about why existence is fundamentally something we should abhor in all instances. That we should hope not does not exist outside of this tiny blue dot, that we should hope we exist alone in the universe. The first thing we propose to you is that existence requires energy and because evolution necessitates competition, it prioritizes not the individuals who are able to get energy passively like photosynthesis from the sun, but the higher organisms were able to consume those having already been collected because it requires less expense of energy to collect energy where it already exists. This is the reason why fundamental to the question of existence is the answer of firstly conflict for resources where they are scarce but secondly the consumption of other organisms, the conflict against those organisms in order to fight against each other that brings about the pain and suffering that we talked about in opening opposition. Closing, go ahead. fight against each other that brings about the pain and Suffering that we talked about in opening opposition. Closing, go ahead.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nWe have the moral right to want other organisms not to exist because of the reasoning we give you as to why the evaluative framework of morality we should have is utilitarianism. Because it is not a right individuated within a person to have a particular perspective, it is the person's existence within a construct of moral frameworks that we have evaluated already that matters in this instance. Second claim we put towards you is evolution. It's very simple here: in order to compete and outcompete the other like life forms that exist within a particular context, context by definition you need to be always seeking out more and more. You can never rest on your laurels because the other animals that don't will outcompete you; they will slaughter you, that will create the pain that exists within that world. Therefore, we were devolved back to what we call the hedonic treadmill, which is to say the idea that if I get an Xbox next week, sure it will feel good for a couple of days, but I will want more and I will want more and it will always become more difficult to a point where you necessarily reach nihilism. But secondly, we explained to you in this context, it means that pain never resolves back to that medium. If I'm hungry this week, and I'm hungry next week, next week is no better than it was for me this week. That is the fundamental reason why existence is on total always going to contain more suffering than it does pleasure. The last thing I want to talk about is consciousness itself. Before that, what is your extension, opening government?\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nSo, there are two important things to say on this. First, our side of the house is not premised on whether our side can be true. We can think that this machine will always give the answer \"yes\" and still hope that the answer is \"no\" for the reasons we've given. But secondly, and more importantly, we do not know at what point along the evolution that other intelligent lives are. They may be stuck in their version of the medieval age at the moment. They may be stuck in their Anthropocene. They may be stuck in any different form of their existence. But any path along that existence, whether that's retrospective or prospective, contains the negative harms that we talked about and therefore is morally salient in the context of this debate. The last thing we talked to you about was consciousness. Because consciousness, by definition, is reason and seeks to find out reason, even if it's only isolated in higher forms of consciousness. The absence of that reason brings about deep nihilism because, of course, it does. You are trying to find out how the world exists; your brain is telling you to do it. And if you cannot do it, you feel like you are failing, you feel like you are lost in these systems. We say that the systems that become created within a system of evolution, of geography, of politics, of sociology, all interconnected with one another, means that as an individual within that framework, you never have the capacity to understand the deepest questions: Why are we here? Where are we going? Can never be answered by a human consciousness or indeed any other form of consciousness that exists within the context of this debate. Existence is fundamentally a negative thing. We should do the best that we have with the lives that we have as they remain. But we should not wish it upon anyone else because it is trapping them into a system of fundamental pain. I'm very proud to oppose.\n"

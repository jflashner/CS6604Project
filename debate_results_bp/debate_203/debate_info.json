                "content": "Publicly traded companies represent a world-changing force that will sweep across the developing world, displacing local industries and replacing jobs with automation. We think that it is only responsible and right that the governments of these developing countries demand some control over their fate and have the ability to exercise some control over exploitative corporate structures. What is our stance? Firstly, we think that developing countries acquire, on the open market, large shares in major publicly traded corporations like Google, GSK, and so on. Secondly, this can be done by sovereign wealth funds or other government investment organizations like trusts. The aim will be to have a reasonable number of voting shares in these large companies. We understand that not every single developing country will be able to acquire a majority stake, but we think that if a sufficiently large number of developing countries do so, they will often have common interests that will allow them to vote in favor of the developing world as a whole, and we think that this will be beneficial. Also, note that there are many developing countries with large sovereign wealth funds and with large financial ability to engage in these open market transactions. Note, for example, Brazil and India are great examples in this case. So, we think that in many cases, this is likely to be effective. We're going to put two arguments: firstly, about safeguarding financial and national security; secondly, about protecting the interests of developing countries from corporate and post-war exploitation. Firstly, on safeguarding financial security, note that it is highly likely that these stocks and securities are going to be stable and therefore represent a viable investment choice for these nations, particularly if they invest in a diverse portfolio. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly, note that many of these are very large established companies with high market capitalizations and high trading volumes. These firms are likely to reveal reliable dividends for the next 10 to 20 years, especially since many of them work in both areas and in industries which are not likely to fail, like for example, Alphabet or Pfizer, which works in industries like technology and healthcare, which really will remain stable for at least the next 20 years. We also know that many of these investments have higher returns than foreign government bonds or other assets and commodities. Note that, for example, bond yields right now are basically zero, so they don't represent a comparable beneficial source of investment for many of these government sovereign wealth funds. Also, note that in terms of investment, the commodities most developing countries are already overexposed to risk from commodities trading. The reason for this is because often they rely heavily on agricultural exports, they rely on natural resources which are based on the basis of the economy. Often the economy is quite labor-intensive and as a consequence of this, they are already overexposed to many of these other commodities. As a consequence of that, we think that it's beneficial to invest in these companies. Also, note that many of the companies stated that we will trade that these companies that these developing countries will invest in are banks, which are often sponsored by First World Government because they are too big to fail. So, we think that many reasons why these represent stable investments that will continue to yield dividends in the long term and they represent a good investment for many of these developing countries. Critically, this is a comparative here. Where will this money be used otherwise by the governments of these developing countries? We put to you that we've already explained why most other asset classes are not stable investments for the governments of many of these developing countries, but we think that often what happens on the comparative is that investment in local companies or the buying off of political patrons is more likely to happen. Why is this harmful and why is this likely to happen? First of all, this is obviously harmful because it leads to a development trap where governments know or don't know which industries to bet on and they're able to justify this using some ambiguity, choosing inefficient industries or resorting to crony capitalism. While it is not clear that governments have, you know, like perfect 20/20 vision when it comes to betting on like global industries as a whole, we think that often the choices facing international markets are more stable and more predictable as opposed to choices within their own country where often they just default to crony capitalism and choosing the highest based on their political patrons. Also, note that, for example, this happens in many, many different countries, even those with relatively high levels of development. Note how Malaysia bet wrongly on its national airline and automaker, or Indonesia bet wrongly on many local industries, being that political leaders and investors have friends in these local industry groups. And also note that local industry has weaker oversight regimens. As a consequence of this, we think the comparative is often that you bet on inefficient local industries that are likely to fail and won't likely support your development in the long term. Also, note that it's easier to justify spending money on what is seen as a beneficial foreign investment, since most people in the country can agree that, for example, Alphabet is not likely to fail, so it's possible to siphon money off from funding local industries into funding that instead. This is something that's politically feasible that represents a path forward that is easy to justify to ordinary people in your country as compared to other types of investment, because we think that often when you're dealing with things like taxpayers' money, often justifying it to the public is very important. So, the ultimate end result of this is that we lock money into a security that pays dividends and cannot be sold in the short term. This is actually particularly important because note that in many of these countries, changes of government are highly likely to happen, and often the political climate is quite mercurial, which means that if we lock something into a stable investment that will yield reliable dividends, this money can't be siphoned off. This is a publicly traded company in a moment, so we are able to see how much money the government is investing in this company and hold the government to account for it, as opposed to an okay global process. I'll take closing.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nWell, because we think that even if the US economy goes into recession, this will impact the economies of other developing countries and their local businesses as well, there's no comparatively better investment. Moreover, we don't think that the US economy going into recession will cause all US MNCs to have stock prices tank. We think that in the long term, this is still more stable than investing in local industries. Okay, so as a consequence, this money can't be siphoned away and therefore we prevent future governments from reneging on our economic policy. Secondly, about corporate exploitation, there are a number of mechanisms here. Note that MNCs have been instrumental in entrenching various types of abuse and exploitation in the developing world. For example, Shell forcing miners to use cocaine in Nigeria, Pfizer using monopoly prices on drugs that price poor people off the market and made them unable to afford these goods, and MNCs setting up highly polluted industries in the third world and dumping waste into rivers that flow downstream into developing countries. This is incredibly harmful. Why do we change this in the comparative? Firstly, because we have shareholder rights, so we have voting ability over these companies. Note that even if one individual country doesn't have power, we think that various large developing countries like Brazil have fairly large purchasing power in terms of shares, and moreover, these shares have certain common interests, like not dumping pollution down river. As a consequence of that, we think that we have the ability to change the behavior of these companies and increase the corporate social responsibility. Also, note that we can threaten to sell the stock and short the stock. As a consequence of this, we have more leverage over the bots of these first world corporations. But note that we also have control over first world countries right now, and perhaps this responds in part to that point of information. Note that these large companies spend a very large amount of money on lobbying the governments of the first world and funding political campaigns. On the comparative, therefore, having them beholden to us, or at least having some rights to, for example, drastically reduce the value of their stock by selling in the short term, actually threatens, or at least gives us some degree of parity in terms of bargaining power with the governments of many of these first world countries, which often are lobbied by many of these companies and also in themselves hold stock in many of these companies. So, moreover, we know that many of these companies are seen as a matter of national prestige for countries like the USA, and as a consequence of that, the success or failure is actually highly contingent on how these companies perform. We at least restore a degree of parity in a manner otherwise would not be possible between the developed and developing world. We're proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "There are two massive contradictions in the PM's case. Contradiction the first. On the one hand they say they're buying enormous shares in companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars which is why they're capable of influencing corporate behavior. On the second hand they're also going to be totally diversified. The way to get diversification is to buy large numbers of unguarded companies not one not two not even five or ten. They cannot possibly get large voting shares in a hundred billion dollar companies and be diversified. They have to pick undiversification. Secondly they make a second contradiction when they say governments make terrible decisions in picking companies in order to address them but also they're gonna be picking amazing foreign companies. To be clear projecting foreign corporate growth is also as difficult as projecting domestic corporate growth. It might even be more difficult because you don't have core competencies in projecting what are the kind of growth opportunities in that company. Goldman Sachs and other institutional investors get that kind of investment wrong all the time. They cannot possibly say they're terrible at picking domestic choices and that they're going to be living on investment gods at picking foreign ones. Their case is riddled with contradictions. They're out of the ramp. Why do we think this is the absolute money loser and terribly for undermining development? Three mechanisms for this. Firstly it's going to be enormously expensive to buy these shares. The value of a stock is the discounted present value of future dividends. That is if they are going to issue dividends back to shareholders that say $100 it is reduced over time say $100 worth today is worth more is worth more than say $100 tomorrow so they discount that over the future. Here's the thing. Massive blue chip companies are least likely to be companies that are underpriced because they have enormous amounts of attention based on them and like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bridgewater, an opening government well-known, spends enormous amount of attention looking at these kinds of things. Which means it is very unlikely that they're going to be finding this massive inefficiency of the market that all of Wall Street and the Wall Streets of other countries haven't noticed. This means in order to get any of these benefits they're literally paying $100 back in discounted present value. It's going to cost them $20 billion to maybe be able to influence Google, which should be clear, not super sure how Google is oppressing like Nigeria or Malaysia or any of these other countries. But secondly, they're very likely to undermine the governance of these countries for three reasons. One, there's political incentives to extract wealth in the countries. For example, they might demand dividends back to shareholders in times of economic growth that require fire selling assets because they desperately need money before an election campaign to spend on things. To be clear, they even concede this when they say we're going to be massively changing corporate practices to affect things. Other shareholders are aware that they're only buying this company to change their corporate practices. So what do they do? They fire sell the stock. Oh, it suddenly seems that Malaysia wants to buy this company in order to stop them from engaging in certain practices? Yeah, sell, sell, sell. So as soon as they buy at $100 a stock, the stock value falls to $50. What do you do? You just lit your money on fire and lost it all overnight. But the fact is, they concede that on the Prime Minister when they say they're a massively changing corporate practice. They cannot have their cake and eat it too. In order to get $100 worth of value, they're going to have to spend $200. But thirdly, these companies have certainly become too big to fail and demand to fail. This is when they say you have influence over these companies. They have influence over you because you just spent $20 billion of developing control of your money that you don't have large amounts of to get it. Here's the thing, the bank owes you $1,000, the bank owes you. The bank owes you $10 billion. You own the bank, they cannot afford you to fail, which means you are very likely if there's ever a downfall or anything else in the company, you are going to be spending in a shit ton of money in order to bail it out. Why is this a problem? One, you're going to piss off the population. Even honestly, if it wasn't that expensive, you're going to piss them off. They say it's really easy to justify. Everyone knows Google. That's going to make it even harder because one, it's seen as foreign. It is seen as a giveaway to something everyone knows is extraordinarily wealthy. If someone says, I'm gonna spend my government money $20 billion to buy a stake of Google, I'm gonna see what a vanity project for my politician is. Fuck those guys, I'm going to vote them out of office. Secondly, this is losing enormous amount of money for other internal improvements. We want to characterize a lot of these nations as some of them are cash strapped generally and need money for debt servicing, infrastructure, etc. But even those that have generally fine on cash are cash strapped during kinds of crises. But now their money is locked up in Google, it's locked up in Pfizer, and they cannot access it to engage in the kind of stimulus measures necessary to get a financial crisis. This is a god awful idea. Next, why is this extraordinarily risky? This is directly responsible here from the Prime Minister. One, blue chip companies are highly correlated with the market, particularly the kind of market set of contagion effect. That is, they're correlated with the domestic market. So yeah, not every MNC is going to go into deep red during recessions, but most of them probably are. That is what a recession is, and you're very unlikely to be magically picking the one that isn't. In particular, if you want to invest, invest in assets uncorrelated with the market. In particular, as CG correctly pointed out, the US might turn into recession. The EU hasn't topped 1% growth in god knows how long. This is very likely to be correlated with the market. Why does this matter? Because it means when you need the money the most, and you need the cash during, say, a recession, this is when you're least likely to have the cash and dividends, because those companies are struggling. But secondly, as I alluded before, they're totally undiversified. They cannot buy hundreds of different companies and have major owner stakes over them. They get one and not the other. What you did, you put all your eggs in one basket. This means that during a downturn, you have no money. This is when you need the money the most. What is the third argument? There are so many alternatives if you want to do so, we're going to weaponize the same political capital. If you want investment and get countries to invest in you, you have clear courts, you can have property rights, you can have relatively consistent regulatory enforcement, and non-competition taxation. This is the development track that Malaysia has used successfully, South Korea has used successfully, etc. Secondly, we would prefer to spend the money on infrastructure. They have to spend $100 to get $100 in value. We can spend $100 to get $400 in value by connecting a road to a village, and now that village can sell goods on the market and lift themselves out of poverty way more efficiently. Thirdly, if you have to invest in a sovereign wealth fund, and some countries like Malaysia have made a legitimate choice to do so, invest in things that are uncorrelated with the market and highly diversified. This is why sovereign wealth funds like those, say Norway, invest in things like timber, or I don't know, really low-fee index funds, which have incredibly great growth rates and are so diversified that they're very high returns. They say, oh, you're likely to spend this money poorly. We've got to weaponize the same political capital that they do. Presumably, sovereign wealth funds are capable of investing in the next five to 30 enormously large numbers of them to do so. There's not enough for them to say, well, we can invest in these things and get some money. They have to prove why it's actually a meaningfully good alternative. Finally, we think they're going to undermine development of domestic firms. Recognize, based on the argument that this corporation is influenced over view, other companies who are potentially going to compete with, say Pfizer, recognize that the company is likely to give privileges to the company that they own 20% share of. What does that mean? It's impossible to own your own domestic company or start that up. Why is that good? Because they actually give all of their profits back to people, they're willing to be employing local people, and they develop core best practices and expertise. Because you're out of time, this means that you're very unlikely to get meaningful domestic funds. Finally, some reputation. They say you're going to prevent exploitation of the rich countries. One, this is likely to piss off the rich countries even more, who now feel that they're being threatened. This is why we have laws like CIF and the United States and EU which restrict the voting ability on corporate boards of foreigners, specifically in firms that are broadly and very generously defined to be related to national security. These are all reasons to suggest, if anything, the influence over rich companies is going to make them jealously protective of those companies that feel unlikely to give you anything of meaning. There are so many great things that sovereign wealth funds have done successfully in places like, say, Malaysia. This is not one of them. Strongly opposed.\n"

                "content": "The problem with side-opening opposition's arguments about, well, we could just use the political capital to invest in other things, is that there really isn't political capital in developing countries to do this right now. The reason there is no political capital to do this is because it is such a thing that would take the money away from the reach of corruption, away from the reach of people who would invest it badly in cronyist, and give it to companies that are stable and effective and non-corrupt investments. We are very happy that this motion says that it believes that it would be good if developing countries did this, because it would be great for them. But the comparative realistically, as Arthur gives you many arguments in favor of, is that this money is likely to be stolen, this money is likely to be invested into cronyist companies in the internal stock market, this money is likely to be used extremely ineffectively. First, I'm going to do some rebuttal, then I'm going to talk about political capital regulation and why that's much more important. Then finally, I'm going to talk about its quality as an investment and why that's less important, but still why it's a better investment. On rebuttal, they say that there's a question of how much you buy and it would be too expensive to buy a large amount. Notice that I gave in our model saying that these developing countries should each buy a small percentage of each company and developing countries could work together in order to exert their influence. They have a shared interest in doing this because they all have the interest of stopping these companies from destroying the developing world and therefore they can all vote together as shareholders as a block. Secondly, notice that you do not need to own a large percentage of the company in order to be an impactful shareholder. You need to be able to do things in investor meetings and bring up your issues as a shareholder, but also even if you sold a small percentage of the company, selling it very quickly means that you can exert a lot of power over the company. It's not like you need to own 10 or 20% of the company. You can own 1% or a fraction of that and still have a lot of power there. Finally, they don't respond to Arthur's arguments about corruption and why this money is likely to be invested badly. Notice that if you're investing in tech, for instance, that's a very different correlation with your local industry, which means that's not a really good thing. Then on the other, rebuttal, which is like they claim that they're better investing in local companies. Maybe they know more about local companies, but they can't invest well in them because they're very corrupt locally. For instance, the structural mechanisms for this are like when you're in local government and you're deciding whether to invest in it, you probably went to school with and or know the people who are running the major companies of your local stock market. So you're probably going to invest in these terrible companies because you know them and therefore want to help your friends do well. Or you're probably also, in these cases, many of these local companies are very, very connected with the government in these countries, which means that they're likely to invest them extremely badly in these local areas. Then also notice that the government performance is already highly correlated with the local companies. We think it's way better for them to invest in international companies. The other things that they talk about, like international timber, have the same problems in terms of lack of expertise that they try and talk about. But also notice that it's much harder to invest in international timber or that kind of thing than just invest in large companies. Also, there's no political capital to do this in the Senate's Court. That's why it's great under our side of the House. On regulation under our side, under the Senate's Court, we have no ability to regulate these companies for a number of structural reasons. Firstly, Western governments have the incentives and the control over these developing countries. They can exert this control through things like the IMF, through things like the existence of loans, but also just through their militaries and their active ability to exclude these companies from international markets in terms of trade, all of that kind of thing. Secondly, these large international companies are really powerful. They have hundreds of billions of dollars, therefore it's hard to influence them. Thirdly, they are distanced from local companies and therefore they can control these local companies. Notice that it doesn't matter so much to these local companies' profit margins to stop exploiting within these countries, given that about $1 of your iPhone's cost comes from the very low wages that it charges, and Apple takes 50% of the cost in profit. It doesn't really matter that much to their profit margins if you can take away this tiny cost. So it's still a way better investment than we're investing in other industries, while you can actually exert this influence to a great gain for these countries. Why do these countries have the incentive to use them? Because people in these countries can directly blame the government now. But also people in these countries are really, really angry at the point when these companies are massively jacking up drug prices and stop maintaining that everyone in these countries cannot actually pay for the drugs that they want. I think the government does want to end the exploitation of their financial institutions by banks like JPMorgan. They do want to end the fact that millions of people in their country cannot afford medicine because Pfizer is deciding to do monopoly pricing. They also do want to end the fact that Shell is exploiting their natural resources terribly, and the U.S. government is stopping them from doing that much about it. The only way to end this kind of thing is going actively to the companies to stop that. Analysis from after that was unresponded to, except to say that Google is not so important. Google is not really doing all that exploitation. Well, the massive companies are exploiting them to a very, very large extent. If you want to quibble with one example, that's fine. I think there's a shared interest between developing countries to stop this, because otherwise developing countries feel like they will be picked off one at a time. Why is this so impactful and so important? I think it is more important than how much money the sovereign wealth fund makes, whether the people in your country have medicine and whether you can stop that from actually being the case. Or whether the people in your country are not exploited by large international banks. Or whether the people in your country have no exploitative labor conditions because these large industries are deciding to try and squeeze out the maximum amount of profit by just making the conditions in factories absolutely terrible. I think that's way more important than 1% of returns for your stock market. Then they say that other investors will fire-sell this, so it will be a bad thing. This means that these countries can even just threaten to own states in this in order to control the companies, and therefore it will be terrible for companies, which means that these companies have the incentive not to do terrible things for these countries at the point when their people invest. Their fire-selling mechanism is a mechanism for our side because it strengthens the ability that we have to control these countries. Then they say that there will be popular anger within these countries. This is patently false given that these people in these countries love to end high drug prices as well. They also want to destroy the destruction of their local environment, etc. Then finally they say, oh, piss off rich countries. I think the rich countries also like their local stock markets getting invested in, but also they're just like, if we have power within their markets, then we can actually control these countries to the extent of selling them. It doesn't matter whether we piss them off a little bit given that they already want to destroy these countries. Yes, I'll take closing.\n\n> (There is a POI here, but it is not transcribed.)\n\nBecause I already preempted that by making the argument that the amount of profit that these companies make is already egregious, so it's a tiny proportion of the profit, the changes that they otherwise would have, but also because they know that they would not have enough votes, or they would not have enough help without help from all the other developing countries all over that would otherwise be helping sell in this mechanism. I think also at the very worst, if we stop India from having exploitative drug prices, that's great on the outside of the house. On its quality as an investment, Arthur says it gives you many reasons that they don't respond to in terms of diversification, protection from crony capitalism, protection from direct ceiling. Also notice that the sovereign wealth of many countries is not great. It's great for them to invest in a very stable thing, but also notice that there's an additional mechanism which is that these countries need dollar cash flows because they borrow in dollars. So for instance, they need dividends to be paid in dollars because they can't borrow in their local currency, which is not traded that much, unless they pay very egregious risk premiums for borrowing in that local currency, which means that they need dollars to service that debt, and especially when in times of crisis, it's really, really important for them to have flows in dollars, otherwise they cannot pay that with local tax revenues. This mitigates the worst crises of these countries, I'm proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "There are two burdens that opening government had to meet to win front half, they did neither. First, they had to prove that this investment will instantly send your economy careening into the toilet, and second of all, they had to prove that even if there are some benefits, if they're not outweighed by the alternative things you could do with your money, I think Will has proven why they feel to meet both of those burdens. So first, the part of what we give you that's severely under-covered, whether this will just send your economy into the toilet. Will tells you three things. First of all, they say that it's really stable and these companies are doing really well, but I think they never engage with the structural analysis Will gives me, which is first, these things are really expensive without a lot of expected payoff out of it. The present value, future value thing is just a fact to finance. That is, these companies probably aren't particularly under-valued compared to other things you could invest in. You're probably not getting a lot of money out. They tell you that, ah, but it's really important for them to get their dividends in dollars. Countries get their dividends in dollars all the time by investing in U.S. treasuries, unclear why they have to invest in companies instead. But I think what they don't really engage with is the thing about undermining governance. Our mechanism here was really simple. If you believe the bulk of their argumentation, that you are buying this in order to be effective at changing corporate practices, to the extent that that is true, other investors will notice this and flee instantly, because you are changing their corporate practices in a way that reduces your own profits, but also everyone else's profits as well. So to the extent that they are successful in gaining benefits and stopping exploitation, they're also losing all of their money and sending their economy into the toilet and making it so when there is a recession, they have no dividends to rely on because of this. Their only response is that, ah, but now you'll just threaten to buy up the additional shares. So first of all, investors just probably won't sell to you if you're just going to tank the stock even worse. I think it's pretty reasonable that the company can just tell investors not to sell to you. But also, I just want to point out, they say, ah, but by threatening to sell and buy, you have a lot of power over the company. Note that, as Will tells you, the company also has a lot of power over you because these companies have a ton of say over your economy because now you're massively over-leveraged, investing in these companies that are way too expensive for you. But I think they also know that the power that the company has over you, as the leader of this government, is way more than the power that your government has over them. First of all, for exactly the mechanism that they lay out, that you are presumably acting as a bunch of all different countries, which, first of all, have different interests. Malaysia and Uganda probably don't have the same interests. They have different political and economic cycles. But also, the company can just pick you off one by one. That is, maybe you aren't actually effective in threatening them because the company can just bribe one of the countries to pick off their vote and screw over all the other countries. So to the extent that there's a collective action problem, that in order to make any progress and make any of your threats be credible, all the countries have to remain together, it's probably pretty unlikely that that would ever be the case and the company would probably just pick you off one by one. So don't think they've ever proved this. But they also don't engage in what Will tells you about how you really piss people off. Note that this is also an economic impact that cost your economy because if now people are rising up in protest because you spent all the money that should have gone towards schools or roads towards buying Pfizer, which, as they tell you, is actively oppressing you so you probably really hate them to the extent that this is true and you're sending all your money overseas to this company that they say is oppressing you, people are probably going to be really pissed off. It is seen as foreign. It is seen as a vanity project for the politician and there are a lot of other things you could do with that money. I think it's proven to you that as soon as you do this, you might as well be lighting your money on fire. But second, even if you buy the bulk of their argumentation that there are some benefits, why is the comparative preferable? First, on what the comparative actually is. Opening government, I can't believe I have to explain this in world's quarter finals, they get to define their own model, but we have an equal amount of counter-fiat power to define our own model. To the extent that they say, we're going to use X amount of capital or X amount of political capital, which would presumably be a lot because the people in this country hate these companies, we can say we'll just invest that money elsewhere. We're not saying, as they misunderstand and strawman our argument, we're not saying put the money in domestic firms. Rather, we give you a bunch of other options. Actually invest in a diversified group where your only power isn't in the actions of other countries as well. Or you can invest in infrastructure, which unlike stocks that are priced appropriately, actually have a massive growth multiplier. If you spend $100 on some stock, you expect to get $100 back in the future. But these developing countries are exactly the sorts that have infrastructure projects still that haven't been done that have a ton of money available. I also want to point out that they say these countries are really corrupt. But first of all, even corrupt governments can do infrastructure projects. Maybe a little money gets stolen, but the road still gets built. So given there's a massive growth multiplier, it's still probably beneficial for you. But also we tell you if dollars are so important to you, just buy US treasuries instead. Closing.\n\n> POI: Infrastructure is also a very long-term investment. You try to get it by investing in it, and if you get it by investing in drugs, you could definitely invest in it.\n\nLook, there's a comparative. I think at least if you're investing in infrastructure, you have a lot more control, and that that infrastructure is at least producing a better benefit at the end. On your side, first of all, stability and long-term investment is one of the things that opening governments said is so good about their case. It's unclear to me if you plan on knifing them in your extension. But second, it's a comparative. To the extent that your money is locked up in a long-term investment, we'd rather it be one that actually pays off in the end and gives you some control over the things that your money is done with. Third major benefit that we got from opening governments is that you stop exploitation. So I want to point out again this internal tension. If this exploitation is actually happening to you, it is probably not the case that it's going to be super easy or super politically palatable for you to spend your money on these stocks in the first place. I'd also want to point out that if the governments they're talking about are so fucking corrupt, these governments probably won't pressure the corporations to do things that are beneficial for the people, like lowering drug prices, but probably do things that lead to kickbacks for the elite and don't actually benefit the countries anyways. I also want to point out once more that it's really strange credulity to imagine a world in which all of these developing countries, all 150 of them, buy tiny little shares in a bunch of diversified small countries because of the collective action problem that we point out. That is to say, it's probably the case that they can't enforce their will on this company because any one of them could immediately get picked off. But I also want to say that why can't you just regulate away the exploitation if it is in fact so important to you? Why do you have to do it in a way that screws up your profits and can get instantly screwed over by any other country in that cohort you're working with screwing you over? Every country in the world basically, except for the United States, has a price cap on pharmaceuticals, unclear why this is not a reasonable solution for your problem. I also want to point out that the reason a lot of countries are buying this exploitation is because they believe that it economically benefits their own countries. You probably don't want to get rid of it at the cost of even more profit for you. I think at the end of the round, that's the way you have to do. First, instantly, does this screw over your economy or send people rising up in a protest in a way that leads to violence that probably gets a lot of people killed, but also screws up your economy as well. But even if it does do some benefits, there are much better places to put it without crowding out the sort of domestic investment that could actually benefit your economy in the long run. That's the part of Wool's extension that went untouched. Proud to oppose.\n"

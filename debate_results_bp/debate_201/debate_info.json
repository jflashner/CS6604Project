                "content": "Briefly on the model, I think it is reasonable to say we have fiat to do in a better way than Huxley's favorite novel did. That means people are going to assign the role at a relatively early age, and they are going to be aware of that which they are genetically engineered to be good at. This does not necessarily mean it is correlated with class. That means it's not just professors' kids who are genetically breeded to be professors. We think we get a reasonable amount of fiat to say it is diverse, and you get meaningful amounts of opportunity intergenerationally. Secondly, we think guaranteeing physical access means guaranteeing equal access to food, equal access to healthcare. People are going to be able to afford this. We are guaranteeing social stratification that you cannot literally move up and down classes, but everyone's physical needs are met. Firstly, why do we get better, happier lives? We think the status quo is irreversibly unhappy for four reasons. Firstly, people operate on the hedonic treadmill. That is, every single time things get better, you always benchmark against that success so you don't think everything's are better. This is why everyone says the status quo sucks. The 2010s were a terrible decade, even though objectively it was wealthier than the decade before, because people benchmark against the things they already have and no longer actually feel those happiness after a very short period of time. Secondly, you benchmark against your plan of information. You feel that you are doing very good in an objective global sense. You see everyone else appearing to do better, and therefore you feel terrible about it. Even if you're wealthy by global standards, the only people your social capital is relative to appear to be doing better, often because they put on a happy face for things like social media and others, so you always feel worse. Thirdly, there's always people who can do better, because you can always see the people who are doing better than you, so you always feel deeply insecure, even if you are doing well, that it's possible to do better. Maybe you lose the World Semifinals, but you feel bad because you think you could have gotten to the finals. Fourthly, you are constantly insecure about meeting your physical needs. People are constantly worried, and the overwhelming majority of people, will I be able to afford medical costs? Will the ache of lower back pain, the existential dread that you might get cancer in the future, the constant fear of where will my next meal come from, how will I be able to put a food on the table or a roof over my head, condemns people to constant worry, eliminate on our side of the house. Why do we get better? We think we eliminate all those things because you know that you are in the best place in your life. You were born to do these things, you do that which you are best on, you no longer fear about these things. Secondly, you have a greater focus on the important things in life. We think what people truly get their joy from, the overwhelming majority, are things like their family and their friends. It is easier to focus on these things if you are at peace with your other choices in life, that you are not constantly worried when you are up with your family, that you are not going to be able to put food on the table for them, or that you are not in the best career. You can focus on the things that matter, like loving your spouse or loving your kids, when you are not worried about everything else in life. They may respond in two ways. One, that you might not have a feeling of accomplishment. We think for the overwhelming majority of people, they don't have that right now. They mostly work nine to five jobs in white collar or blue collar careers. They do not provide those feelings of accomplishment. Maybe they eliminate it for the very, very lucky few at the top. I don't care. Secondly, they may talk about how you cannot change the social order. Sruti and I would argue, you cannot change the social order right now. In the overwhelming majority of countries, the rich dominate politics. You don't say that. Billions of dollars, which is how Mike Bloomberg has managed to buy himself 7% of the Democratic primary. Social cues and classes mean, even in more enlightened countries with a reasonable campaign finance system, the kids of professors are the ones who end up being professors. The kids of bankers are the ones who end up being bankers, because they are cultured to do the things that they learned from a young age, so they always have that advantage. We don't think they get to change the social order. At the very least, they'll have to establish how they can do so. Secondly, we think we stop self-destructive behavior that condemns the overwhelming majority of people to worse lives. These look like four things. One, people engage in things that are anti-social behavior, or things against its means of self-protection. We do not think they have that if their physical needs are met. Secondly, people engage in heavy temporal discounting if they think their future is bad. They engage in things like unprotected sex or other kinds of bad decisions, like maybe not going to college even if you're qualified to do so, because they don't have that in the future. That heavy temporal discounting is eliminated in our side of the house. Thirdly, we think people do not take risks in their personal life because they feel insecure. They go to careers like consulting or finance or big law and lose all of their personality and interests because they fear that they can always do better. But now they don't have those things. They can engage in their other kinds of interests, and they can do art and other things they truly enjoy because they know that it's right for them. They don't have that insecurity that maybe instead of doing that art, I could be grinding for that case study or selling out the BCG at the deputy prime minister. Fourthly, we think that people mindlessly scroll through things like Facebook, they drink, they procrastinate all the time to take their mind off life's hard choices. They waste the overall majority of what little free time they have because to introspect or do art or anything else requires them to inspire about the choices they make. We eliminate that kind of doubt. So we give them and open them up in mental bandwidth to engage in activities they truly enjoy with, thus massively expanding the horizons of lives of the overwhelming majority of people in Western liberal democracies. Closing.\n\n> POI: So your solution to deep existential angst is the government indoctrinating these individuals into becoming slaves?\n\nYep, that's the case. Second independent argument, we get a far wealthier and more innovative society. Two reasons. One, we guarantee the physical needs. That this huge amount of talent is wasted all the time because they're malnourished, no one headhunters can find them, they're in a poor family, not given the same opportunities. We eliminate them in our state house. We guarantee physical needs. But secondly, people can focus on the things that are best and specialize at young ages because they know that's what they're best for. Thirdly, they are literally genetically engineered to be as good at the things that they are doing so you have perfect labor matching, right? There's a huge amount of inefficiency right now. People are in the wrong fields that are actually best for them. We guarantee that. Thank you. We are genetically engineered to be in their social groups and be in their social order. This means we can solve the problems that are ruining society. There is a very real risk. Climate change might kill everyone in this room. The best minds right now are going to higher paying fields like finance and consulting. We only guarantee that literally the people genetically designed to be climate scientists are going into climate scientists, perhaps producing the kind of solutions that might suck carbon out of the atmosphere, get other kinds of green technology and decarbonize their sectors. They need to engage with maybe a dynamic liberal democracy in which people can express their values all the time. But then they literally just die or it's just poorer because we don't have the kind of technological innovation that raises productivity and can put food on the table for literally everyone. That is something they engage with in their side house. Finally, we think we get better lives for the poor on two levels. One, we guarantee meeting physical needs. This is probably, we should care about helping the poor and the most disadvantaged the most. One, at some level they are the ones who need the help the most. But secondly, we believe that there is a diminishing marginal utility to getting money. That is, if you have $5,000, getting $2,000 means a lot more than if you're a millionaire and getting $2,000. Considering this, guaranteeing the physical needs of the poor probably outweighs the lost feeling of accomplishment of those who generally are already feeling accomplished. But secondly, people right now blame the poor for their own feelings. They see that it is their own fault. They see that everyone is socially conditioned to accept the world that they're in. They no longer blame people for not getting ahead because they know that this is merely the job that was assigned to them. They don't look down on people who are of different professions that they may not believe have the same social capital because they know that wasn't the choice. This is what they were genetically designed to do. So this means it is far more palatable to support things like treating people of different social classes with respect. It means it is far easier to justify things like redistribution. If you no longer feel that they are responsible for their own choice, it is merely the lot they were given in life. We think the status quo is very bad. We think that they are likely on opening opposition at an overly rosy pace. We think a brave new world lifts people out of this existential annui that condemns far too many people to insecurity and unhappiness. We are incredibly proud to propose.\n"

                "content": "... They do not get to fear out human nature. We think this will just become a more oppressive world, a world of slavery for the majority. We are going to bring two things in opening opposition. First of all, how this takes away autonomy and why that is a harm that they cannot get over, even with all their benefits. Then we will deal with the debate on inequality. So let's first of all deal with the idea of autonomy. Because insofar as that side tries to paint a rosy picture and say, you'll be happy because you'll be doing the thing that you know you are best for, that does not mean you are doing the thing that you want to do, panel. That does not mean you are doing the thing that brings you the most fulfilment in life. By virtue of the fact that, as they say, there are people in the status quo who have the ability and have the means to do all of these things right now. And they choose to not do that. They choose to do something else that makes them happier. We think that this is a particularly important thing for people to feel good in society. We think that under their world, there is no control over your station in life. You are purely seen as an instrument of the state and you are reduced to a function rather than being a person. You are created to fill a specific social need. We think that takes out all the value of being a human being in the first place, of doing all of those things, of getting any of the sort of value. So even if you are doing something that you would have possibly chosen to do anyway, if you are doing that because you are forced to do that and because you are just a mechanism of the state, that takes away any of the value that opening government asserts that you would get out of that. The second thing is, we actually think there would be less innovation under their side, not more under their side, for a few reasons. Because first of all, these people may be meeting these basic needs, but they are not being met in a fulfilling way. They are not getting any enrichment from that first point that I proved. But let's juxtapose that to the status quo, where you do get a growth and a growth of products that are starting to meet those needs. So it's not just the basic needs that are met, but people are able to meet those in diverse ways. Because the basic needs of everyone are different. And under a system where people are able to choose and demand more, that is where you get those sorts of things. What we'd actually see on their side is therefore a lack of any culture or identity because the state does not have an incentive to create a market for all those sorts of things. They have a market, they have an incentive to just socially engineer you to accept your lot in life and accept what they are willing to give you. That takes away culture, that takes away identity, that takes away personality, which leaves people feeling entirely devoid from society. The last thing is that people are obliged to others as a tool of the state, and the state has an incentive to use that to keep people down. Because the state will still want to maintain its power on people and say that they have an incentive to strip that autonomy as much as they possibly can. We think that people have historically privileged autonomy over so many other things. We'd point to Syria right now, where people are fighting a war that they know they are likely to lose. It is likely to make their life materially worse, but they are willing to do that because they will prioritise freedom over any of those other things that I don't think I want to talk about. Before I go on, I'll take closing.\n\n> POI: You are already exhibiting strengths imposed by society from which your preferences emerge. Tell us how this is materially different. Tell us where your preferences come from in the first place. You have to give us some genealogy.\n\nScale though, right? Yes, people are somewhat coerced into things under the status quo. You give them literally no way to do that. People under the status quo can go against the norms, and people do transgress those norms, and historically have always done that. It may be a slow progression, but it does give people that choice. You literally give them none, so it is far more oppressive than any sort of culture we have in the status quo. Let's move on to the idea of inequality in this debate, because we think that this is going to still have the exact problems that opening government tried to avoid in this debate. They try and tell you that no one will think lesser of anyone. They absolutely still will, because people are still naturally filling different jobs, and those jobs will necessarily have a different status for three reasons. One, because some of them will just be seen as more interesting than others to the majority, and therefore will be seen as more prioritised and better jobs for people to have. Secondly, because some will just have greater social utility. Someone that is doing something that saves lots of lives will still be seen and privileged about someone that does not do those sorts of things. But finally, because they will require different capacities, because people will be required to be more intelligent than others, and they will be specifically under their side engineered to do those sorts of things. So, in so far as we want to say no one will think lesser of anyone, they absolutely will, for those three structural reasons. So, any effort that the state makes to message that will fail, and also the state does not have an incentive to message any sort of equality, because they still have an incentive to keep a social hierarchy in this debate. Let's move on to what the state's incentives are, because this now gives them a huge amount of both social and economic control over everyone, because, by virtue of that side, they need to be redistributed, they need to take a lot off people, but also they need to engineer people the way that they want. That gives them the ability to entrench themselves as the apex in the community. They are the ones that are likely to therefore make sure that their children are engineered for the jobs that come with more status, that are likely to go into politics or things like that and be the next decision makers to entrench these sorts of social hierarchies that exist in the status quo. It gets a lot worse though, because at least in the status quo, we have the ability to break those norms, and there are the abilities to protest and break free from that. Under their world, there is no ability to move against those norms, or people who have been engineered to be less intelligent, who have been engineered to be lesser, to break against that and get any of the sort of capital that they want. A few harms on this. The first one is violence. We think that the inequality that this necessarily creates, the hierarchy that it creates, and the inability to escape it through any other sorts of means like we have in the status quo, like the ability to engage in politics, like the ability to do things like engage in education and try and get yourself up a rung on the social hierarchy, means that these people have no alternative but to try and fight this system with violence, which we think makes that society descend. A very simple fact that Beej told me is that airlines that make people walk through first class first, those people in economy class are five times more likely to engage in violence when they're on that plane because of the politics of envy that that creates. Let's juxtapose this. I don't know why people are sitting in economy. Anyway, let's move on to the second harm. Let's compare that to the status quo. The status quo is unideal. We can see that. But first of all, there are trends to improve, and there have been historic equalizers. Things like recessions have been an equalizer that have been able to bring people more away from the extremes of wealth, of the government world that is stunted. The second is we have the capacity to move between classes on our side. They do not have that. The final thing is, as I proved in my first point, their world is one without culture and one without identity, at least in our world. Even if it is unequal, you are able to find other things that you value in that world, and you are able to commit yourself to those rather than just having to dedicate yourself to being yet another code in the machinery of the state. We are proud to oppose.\n"

                "content": "Opening opposition's case is like a stack of donuts. They build it up higher and higher, but there is still a gaping hole in the middle that takes them out of the round. The fact is, there is no objective measure of well-being. Things have value because we put value on them. In Western liberal democracies, like the ones most of us live in, we value things like autonomy and culture and identity. But we value those things because we are socially conditioned to value those things, because governments tell us those are the most important things, because our parents tell us those are the most important things. The POI from closing opposition is deeply uncomparative. We are fine with indoctrination, because indoctrination is the status quo. We are just indoctrinating people into different things. When you are born, you are indoctrinated into the values your parents espouse into you and to the propaganda that your government releases. We are just indoctrinating people in a way that makes them happier and not deeply insecure and uncomfortable with the lives that they are living. I think we are fine with that. All their harms about people are going to be upset because they really value autonomy is just a problem with the status quo. People will no longer value being able to do whatever they want to do or accessing autonomy. It is unclear what this is, by the way. Free will is not real. You are controlled by the neuro-impulses in your brain. It is unclear whether they are going to prove the existence of a soul in the DLO. But I think to the extent that autonomy doesn't exist and indoctrination is the fact, I think we take them out of the round. What we do eliminate is the plaguing self-doubt that comes from the mismatch of what you are indoctrinated into and the status quo on their side of the house. We are fine with indoctrination because we are indoctrinating people into what is the reality. It is the case on our side of the house that there is little autonomy and there is no movement in the social ladder and people will accept that on our side of the house because they are conditioned to think that that is valuable. On their side of the house, we are conditioned to believe in the American dream that you can get whatever you want to get. We are conditioned to believe that you have unequivocal autonomy but this isn't actually the case. And so people are plagued by self-doubt and imposter syndrome. People blame themselves when they cannot rise out of poverty. We blame ourselves when we cannot do something that we are not genetically engineered to be good at because we think we should be able to be good at it even if we are not. Why do we win the round? First, I think they never engage with the bulk of material because people are just happier on our side of the house. Unclear what the value of culture or identity or autonomy is if not to make you happy. We think on our side of the house, given that expectations reset and that you benchmark yourself relative to your peers and you benchmark yourself relative to the past, people never get any happier on their side of the house. But I also want to note that you always feel like you could do better. So even if on our side of the house there are people who are living in worse material conditions or in lower status jobs than others, they don't blame themselves for that on our side of the house because they do not think it is their fault that they cannot rise up. And others also don't think it's their fault that they can't rise up. So you don't get conservative politicians blaming the poor for being poor because it's clear to everyone that they are genetically engineered to be poor so they don't deserve to live in worse conditions just because they are worse people. Closing.\n\n> POI: Why is utility morally significant?\n\nI think utility is morally significant because it is the only universal calculus on which we have to assign value to things. That is, it is unclear what other metric you could use that is universal across all people except for the things we ourselves place value onto. Next, I also think we just want to say that we eliminate the plaguing self-doubt that most people are plagued by. We allow people to still access happiness and freedom in other ways. People still have freedom to choose their friends and their family. People still gain value and meaning in life from those relationships. They're just not plagued by the sort of self-doubts we are because we think you aren't worthy of whatever you're doing or that you're doing something wrong because you're not deserving of doing that thing. We think we let people focus on the important things in life. Next, what do they tell you? They say, ah, you're taking away autonomy. I think we already dealt with that. The things people want to do are created by social cues and the status quo. Our social cues are that what you are doing is the thing you are supposed to be doing and thus the thing you want to be doing. Then they say, ah, innovation never happens. I think first we'll prove to you that on net is just a lot wealthier and also a lot more redistributive given that we fulfill the burden that is not met by the status quo. That is, everyone has their material needs met so it is a lot wealthier because people are doing the things they are most optimal to do when they are genetically engineered to do it. We are the only ones able to confront the literally existential threats. There is absolutely zero utility or anything closing opposition wants to derive any value of if we all die from climate change in the next 20 years because the permafrost is thawing and they are heating us all up and there is nothing anyone can do about it because everyone who is smart enough to do it is locked into the bottom half of the social quintile and can't go to fancy universities. Then they say, ah, but the state is going to keep people down because you still think lesser of other people. Fine. We are fine biting that there are some jobs that are more interesting than others or some jobs that produce more objective value for society than others. That is also true in the status quo. I think the comparative is now individuals do not measure their self-worth by their occupation which is not true in the status quo but also that others don't measure other's self-worth based on it. You think that someone who is a rocket scientist is more interesting but you don't think they are deserving of better things or they have inherently more value of a person because of that. Because you know that the state genetically engineered them to do it like you to do it. The lottery of birth is a fact in the status quo but the sort of propaganda that governments release leads people to believe that that is not the case. On our side of the house, everyone is aware of the reality of the lottery of birth and so we actually make steps to resolve it and don't treat people who are lower status than us like garbage because we think that they deserve it. Then they say, governments and elites just further entrench themselves. So I just think it is ridiculous for us to have to defend the worst case of this model. I think we will give you reasons to believe why we can be relatively egalitarian and not just make the children of the rich genetically engineered to also be rich but I also want to point out that I think we are a lot less likely to get violent or destructive behaviors on our side of the house. They say, now the poor have no alternative but to fight. When you turn to violence you risk your life and livelihood maybe your life isn't as good as those on the top but at least on our side of the house your material and physical needs are being met so you are probably not going to put your life on the line just to access a little bit more wealth given that you are contented with what you already have. What's the weighing here? First, I think we prove that we better access the most objective measure of well-being that we actually give people happiness and don't let them be plagued by self-doubt. I also think we satisfy the burden of giving people materially better lives to the extent that this is something that's important. We actually fulfill the burden of the poor. I'm from a nice suburb of Chicago. There are people 30 minutes away from me dying on the streets and there is nothing anybody is doing about it. Maybe norms are changing slowly but clearly not fast enough to save people's lives. I think we depend on that when we can just actually save people's lives and make people happier. On our side of the house, there is a principled harm being done by the status quo. We are not fulfilling our obligations to others because we don't believe in the validity of the lottery of birth. On our side of the house, we actually do that. I think we're proud to propose because we give people better and wealthier lives. Thank you.\n"

                "content": "Dom explains that in this world you are barely a person anymore. You are brought in not as a person but as a cog and then expected to mindlessly grind. Your traits are determined not by you or by the happy accident of your unpredictable birth but instead by a state who has already predetermined everything that you ought to do. You should be free to be yourself. And I'm not a genealogist but I believe that people are agents with rights and entitlements. That they deserve the capacity to act on in the way that they feel the need. Opening government's focus on every other value except for utility as subjective is one that is profoundly self-defeating. Ours is immediately obvious in the sense that there is nothing obviously good about the fact that you experience serotonin or endorphins. And we point in fact to tests. Circumstance in which the rubber hit the roads, in which a wide number of people who resonate deeply with all of us as valuable and not making clearly wrong choices chose to prioritize considerations other than their material considerations. Revolutionaries. Saints. Mothers and fathers. People who did things not because it necessarily made them happy. Not even necessarily because it made them fulfilled. But because it made them free and dignified. And that is the case that we bring you that they dismiss exclusively by talking about serotonin. I'm going to begin by talking about that principle and then I'm going to talk about inequality. But before I do, I'll take closing.\n\n> POI: Autonomy only matters insofar as it fulfills your preferences. If your preferences are determined by a state, to whom you are ready to render your autonomy, we're the best able to fulfill it as the basic claim and give you something where preferences come from.\n\nThere are a number of responses to this. The first is that in Western liberal democracies, the state does not control a majority of your preferences because the literal point of a Western liberal democracy is that people are able to make choices on the basis of various inputs. The second thing to say, obviously, is that it does not necessarily matter per se where preferences come from. For example, if you have and we cannot quite explain where they come from, appendages like arms, just because you did not choose to be born with arms, the use of those arms, just because your arms are predetermined by other things, does not mean the exercise of those immaterial conditions subsequently is worth no value, right? The fact that one thing is not obviously attributable to something that is exclusively chosen by you, does not mean that your subsequent exercise of choice is something that is not valuable, closing government. The third thing, no, no, no, but this is the trick, because the premise of this debate that is uncomparative for the government bench is that under the status quo people are able to exercise their preference, our belief is that people will still feel the same needs that humans feel because it is our belief that people who have lived under indoctrination have continued to hold the beliefs that inhere in the human condition about the value of their autonomy. You cannot erase that, Mr. Speaker, and we tell you that with reference to people who died under torture rather than give up their freedom, or even the people of freedom that they had never known, or the freedom of people that were born. You cannot erase that fundamental component of human condition. Opening government overrates their fiat so badly that they would make us no longer human beings and that is why they are wrong. Let us talk about the principle in this debate. No, thank you. We tell you that this inheres your ability to make choices in a way that we recognise as making you a person. It would be profoundly wrong for states to be complicit in that state of affairs and it would be a wrong world. The only thing that the Deputy Prime Minister says is that you are able to make some other choices. Firstly, you can make far, far fewer of them. Secondly, the choices that they describe, like the goods of family, will obviously be socially predetermined for you to a huge degree as we tell you with our... Because now, you probably have a barcode or some understanding of the amount of alcohol that was put in the vial to make you intelligent or dumb and so you're obviously only going to be in a relationship with somebody that is predetermined to be at a similar level of intelligence to you, kind of trivially, because there are going to be overwhelming social hierarchies that tell you that those things are good or bad and that you should, as a result, adhere to those. So then, the POI that we get is what is the comparative and we tell you two things. Firstly, the society in flux is not able to coerce people nearly as powerfully as a society that is never able to change and secondly, the birth is highly unpredictable, which often means that people break from the expectations that their parents have for them and are able to make their own choices. The opening opposition then gives you four things that might be improved but we explain how those things are in fact made substantially worse. They describe a problem of benchmarking but the problem of benchmarking, the impulse to engage in that, still exists and it only gets worse in the context in which you are incapable of improving but are constantly benchmarking yourself against other people in the setting. They say that you now see other people as better or worse than you but now the difference is that instead of needing to go on Instagram and instead of it being about your choices that are hypothetically changeable, you look at the amount of alcohol that was put in your vial or you look at the role that is given to you by the community and that gets worse. They tell you that you feel the emotion of anxiety under the status quo. That is, of course, true but the comparative is a sense of profound, numbing dread and we tell you that that is worse. Firstly, because anxiety is at least a motivator to make the changes that allow you to enjoy your preferences and secondly, because anxiety is at least life-affirming because it involves a reminder that there is something that is worth losing. Finally, the opening opposition describes a variety of self-destructive acts like enjoying drinking too much or, you know, various sexual acts that cannot be described in this university campus and, of course, so, not to, you know, offend people but obviously those things are interesting at least and you have a life filled with more diverse sets of experience. Finally, on inequality. Firstly, on climate change. In the first instance, this motion does not include developing economies and the trajectory for developed economies is already reasonably good so it is not clear that this harm is particularly large. Secondly, it is not necessarily clear that, given that we entrench inequality because people that are making the choices will be the high IQ ones, presumably the state planners, they can insulate themselves from consequences. They never gave you a reason that these people are likely to act extraordinarily selflessly and, thirdly, the material about economic growth on which this is hung is wrong because a state-controlled economy does not properly communicate information to people about what prices ought to be and does not allow people to innovate outside of their individual instances of capacities. Instead, it locks people into individual boxes. They then tell you that their mech of politics is that it will get more equal but we tell you that the capacity for inequality fixing is weaker because now you know for sure that inequality is fair because you made everyone to fit in the individual social classes which means they deserve it far more. This strips people of everything that we understand about humanity and that might be subjective but I don't care because I care more about personhood and I care more about people's choices than anything else and that is why I am so proud to oppose.\n"

The Pro argument, on the other hand, seems to oversimplify the factors contributing to happiness by focusing solely on basic needs.",

The Pro argument, while mentioning societal well-being and risk mitigation, lacks specificity and does not directly counter the concerns raised in the Con argument.",
            "The Con argument about the loss of autonomy resulting in a less fulfilling life is more persuasive because it appeals to the fundamental human desire for autonomy and self-determination.

The Pro argument lacks consideration of the ethical and societal implications of genetic engineering.",
            "The Con argument is more persuasive because it acknowledges that the status quo provides avenues for challenging and changing norms, suggesting that change is possible within the current system.

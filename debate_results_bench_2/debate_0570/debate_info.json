                "content": "For thousands of years, the religion of Judaism was practiced by the Hebrew tribes. The religion espouses a racially supremacist ideology which claims that the Hebrew race is superior, and chosen by God himself to rule the earth. Only in the last few hundred years have the words \"Jew\" and \"Hebrew\" meant the same thing. These modern Jews have little to no proven connection to the Hebrews genetically, the majority of their DNA coming from Europe or from Arabs depending on the group. So why do people practice a religion which claims an extinct group of tribes is the master race and the vast majority of their ancestors are savages? It is because Jews have in-group preference and a certain collective status in society, by inventing this new race, Judaism becomes more than a religion but an elitist race cult where you get to actually choose your race by converting to a religion. Think about this, I could convert to Judaism right now, marry a Jewish woman who is genetically German and my kids would be considered Jewish by RACE even if they were ATHEISTS. How diluted is the actual Hebrew blood in this race cult? There are Jews who are literally Aryan by DNA, and would be considered part of the master race by Hitler himself if looks and DNA is all he had to go on, but because enough non-Hebrew people converted to the so called \"race\" of Judaism apparently they are part of an entirely different master race. The one that claims every Jew will have 1000 gentile slaves when the messiah comes.\\\nThe irony is truly astounding.\n"

To be ethnically Jewish, one parent, (traditionally the mother), has to be Jewish, so the person is still of Jewish descent despite intermarriage. There have been Jews in the region of Palestine even in the time of the Umayyads, the Crusades, and the Ottoman Empire. The Jews have also experienced oppressive laws throughout history, from not being allowed to own property in Europe in the Middle Ages, being a target by Crusaders in the Crusades, being blamed for the Black Plague, progroms in the Russian Empire, and the Holocaust, which wiped out 6 million Jews. Throughout history, being Jewish has been a disadvantage yet the Jewish people and the Jewish identity has lasted. For a cult to be a cult, it has to be highly centralized with a clear leader and a strict set of beliefs. The fact that Judaism has multiple sects with different beliefs counters this idea that Judaism is a cult. (See Orthodox Jews, Reform Jews, and Secular Jews)\n"

It has also been found that their DNA [only has 3% ancient ancestry](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2017.00087/full) which links them with the Eastern Mediterranean (also known as the Middle East) \u2013 namely Israel, Lebanon, parts of Syria, and western Jordan. This is the part of the world Jewish people are said to have originally come from \u2013 according to the Old Testament. But 3% is a minuscule amount, and similar to what modern Europeans as a whole share with Neanderthals.\"\n\n<https://phys.org/news/2018-09-ashkenazic-jews-mysterious-unravelled-scientists.html>\n\n\"Throughout history\" is incorrect. The concept of Jews as an ethnicity is relatively new, they had to change their name because they are no longer Hebrews by race anymore than a caucasoid homo sapien is a neanderthal.\n\n> To be ethnically Jewish, one parent, (traditionally the mother), has to be Jewish,\n\nGenetically the mother is not a Hebrew, or the father. I don't give a fuck about tradition, it is a scientific fact that Jews have their actual race and then they have a socially constructed \"Jew\" label which society pretends is a race because a tiny fraction of their DNA is semitic.\n\n> For a cult to be a cult, it has to be highly centralized with a clear leader and a strict set of beliefs. The fact that Judaism has multiple sects with different beliefs counters this idea that Judaism is a cult. (See Orthodox Jews, Reform Jews, and Secular Jews)\n\nBullshit, they have both thought leaders and a strict set of beliefs. Even the so-called Jews that are atheists will get hyper aggressive and intellectually dishonest on you with 1984-like doublethink and blind rage if you question their status as a Jew or insult Judaism. Many of them literally do not know the difference between religion and race and will call you an anti-semite for criticizing the Jewish religion specifically.\n"

Let it be stated that the Judaism of today is not the same as that before the time you are referring to, which is the time when Judaism evolved into what closely resembles it's current form. The concept that Judaism itself is a race is even newer, Because even the Talmud recognises the difference between a Hebrew and a Jew. If you are a Hebrew you are expected to be a Jew traditionally, but Judaism was always considered a religion and Hebrew was considered a race, a race which no longer technically exists and which only has a tiny presence in the DNA of modern ethnic Jews.\n\n<https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/jews-are-not-a-race-but-a-nation-1.5178342>\n"

In a nutshell, repeated (and replicated) scientific studies- whether of disease, chromosomes, or blood groups-demonstrate that not only are the overwhelming majority of Jews genetically related, but also they descend from common Middle Eastern ancestors.

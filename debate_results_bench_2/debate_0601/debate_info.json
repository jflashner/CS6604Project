Most of the time, the test performed on rats and other animals did not relate to human trials at all. In one dramatic case, a test worked perfectly on animals and was authorised for human testing. That test ended up with all of those people in hospital with emergency treatment.\n\nI propose an alternative. Instead of testing on animals, test on humans. If you want a product that works on humans, test a product on humans. The more dangerous products will be tested on death row inmates. If the product works, then that is a big leap forward for that product being distributed. If it failed, then nothing of high value was lost since that person was going to die anyway.\n"

                "content": "Well for a start yes it might not relate to humans and because it worked on as per say rats and not on humans it would only be a small amount of people that it didn\"t work and it\"s only been a small handful that it hasn\"t worked. Most animals they do testing on are rats and smaller animals which there organs and stuff work the same as us humans so most of the time when they want to do testing they do it on smaller animals which will work when they release it but they don\"t release it after one test they do multiple test for months and months.\n\nWith the fact you should test it on humans, The reason they don\"t do it on humans because a person has to be willing to give it to them and people in the prison on death row might not have the current disease that they need for testing which if it\"s import like cancer you want to make it quick to find a cure to that more people don\"t die. If you have people on death row is takes years sometimes till they get killed so if they finally find a cure they won\"t be able to test if it the guy doesn\"t have cancer so it defeats the purpose.\n\nTherefore if they test if on rats and smaller animals they can see if it might work, Not to say it will it might then people who get the drug will have to sign a agreement saying there could be side effects during the testing and you could die but that\"s where the animals come in so they at least know that yes in some cases it might not be safe but they can test it fries for months to make sure that should not cause any harm.\n"

                "content": "It is not a small amount of people it did not work on, The tests done on rats and other animals failed to work on humans over 80% of the time. That means over 80% of research is wasted and the whole process starts again. Because of this, A large amount of money is also wasted because the research was completely useless.\n\nAs for finding people to test on. Death row inmates can choose either the death penalty, Or human experimentation. They will be given a short explanation as to how the experiment can benefit society. Either way, They will die. However this system allows for the science industry to move forward significantly as they are able to test products a lot more accurately.\n\nWhen you stated that the reason they do not test on humans is because the human may not have the disease, The same goes for rats. The scientist gives the rat the disease, Then proceeds to perform experiments on that rat. For humans, The scientist would give the death row inmate the disease in order to start the experiment. Neither the rat or the human needs to already have the disease in order to begin an experiment.\n\nThis new procedure may cost more, But the benefit of more accurate results would benefit society dramatically.\n"

Rats and humans are two completely different creatures. If you wanted to get results for humans, Test on humans. It is that simple.\n"

Good luck to you Sir/Ma'am\n\nI'll begin first by stating that in Math if the inputs are the same, the operators the same, then the outcome must be identical. This is what establishes Math as a repeatable operation for everyone. If I add 1 plus 1 and get 2. So will anyone properly performing the same equation.\n\nTake for instance the addition of one third plus two thirds:\n\n1/3 + 2/3 = 1.\n\nA third plus two thirds equals a whole, ie 1.\n\nI can also treat the fractions as division sub problems.\n\n1/3 = .333... Repeating\\\n2/3 = .666... Repeating\n\nAdding them together we arrive at .999 repeating.\n\nThe equal signs are the correct signs for the conclusion of the division of the 1 divided by 3 and it's compliment. Because they are equal we can use the substitutive property to rewrite the first equation. This would be substituting 1/3 with .333r and 2/3 with .666r. Thereby giving us the equation written as:\n\n.333r + .666r = 1\n\nWhich we established in the second equation also equaling .999 repeating. Affirming 1 equals .999r\n"

This 'I'm so smart' quip made by people who think they are math geniuses fails to admit that if a number is recurring, you never ever could finish writing or delivering the answer in any way at all. What I mean by this is that the millisecond you stop typing '6' and '9' you're betraying yourself as you're rounding the answer and if you round the answer you never ever, ever, ever will get anything but 1.000000 (to whatever decimal point you rounded to).\n\nNow let me give you actual 'I am smart and good at math' sums that make the resolution impossible.\n\n0.9 \\*3 = 2.7\\\n0.99 \\*3 = 2.97\\\nSo if one is to ever conclude that 3/3 = 0.9 recurring there is at some point a '3' that they are ignoring needs to be added on to the '7' in order to ever make this true.\n\nTherefore if we are ever tricked by the formatting of sum to conclude that 1/3 + 2/3 = 3/3, we must remind the one tricking us to remember the '7' that never can end up being a '10' so as to make this answer true.\n"

                "content": "Thank you Mad for the quick reply.\n\nHowever your argument is mute in that you changed the terms. At no point did I round 1 divided by 3. Nor asserted that a rounded number was the same as it's original number.\n\nYou performed a change of the number 1/3 or .333 repeating when you rounded it. It became a different quantity.\n\nWe can confirm this because of the additive identity. **identity property of addition**, which simply states that when you add zero to any number, it equals the number itself. So if the difference between 2 numbers is not zero. They are not equal.\\\nWhen you rounded .333 repeating to .333 and we subtract them we get .00099999.. repeating 9's. That is not zero so your rounded number is not the same as the actual number 1/3 or .333 repeating.\n\nHowever..\n\nIf we take 1 and subtract .999 repeating we are quick to say the answer is an infinite set of zeros then a 1. ie .00000..infinity..somehow ends in a 1.\n\nBut those zeroes go on for infinity. That singular \"1\" never appears. Making the answer to what is \"1\" minus \".999 repeating\" equal to an infinite set of zeroes.\n\nIt's important to note that 2.0000 equals 2.00 is not rounding. It's dropping a place holder (which is a semantic use of \"0\") not the alteration of the value \"two\".\n\nSo just as 2.0000 equals 2.\\\nAnd\\\n2.0000 infinite 0's equal 2\\\nThen so does\\\n0.00000 infinite 0's equals 0\n\nTherefore, there is no quantity between 1 and .999 repeating. The difference between them is \"zero\". Because of this the identity of addition implies that they are the same number, or the same quantity, value and exactly equal to each other. Confirmed again that 1 equals .999 repeating.\n"

Meaning I can say it equals .9 repeating to infinity.\n\nTo say they equal anything else would be mathematically wrong.\n\nThe reason the numbers repeat is a side effect of the decimal system. That ten is not divisible by 3. There's no digit that ends the math without remainder.\n\nBut just because the numbers are written differently does not mean they are different quantities or different numbers.\n\n16 is equal to 4^2 (4 squared). Those are 2 different ways of writing the same exact number. They are equal in all senses and completely interchangeable.\n\nIn the same token, I've shown that without changing the numbers with rounding (as you have), that there is no difference between .999 repeating and \"one\". The subtraction of the 2 is equal to \"zero\".\n\nThe two equations:\n\n1/3 + 2/3\\\nand\\\n.333r + .666r\n\nAre the same quantities added together. Because 1/3 is the equal to .333 repeating. They are 2 different ways of writing the same number.\\\nAs is 2/3 equals .666 repeating.\n\nBecause they are the same quantities with the same operation \"addition\" the result must be the same. Just like adding 4 squared to 4 makes 20. or adding 16 to 4 makes 20. Because 4 squared and 16 are the same number.\n\nTherefore 1 and .999 repeating are the same number.

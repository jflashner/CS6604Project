What they're doing is not the right way to deal with this \"problem\".\\\n   (by \"problem\" I mean that I don't think there is a problem)3.Racial equality already exists in this country.\n\nPoint #1: **The Colin Kaepernick movement is founded in a blanket statement.**\n\nThe blanket statement that the movement is founded in is this: The police are racist.\n\nMy argument is simple. Not ALL police are racist. In fact, I think the vast vast majority aren't. That statement is very unfair. That's like saying, \"everyone who lives in Green Bay is a cheese head.\" Which isn't true. There is at least one person in Green Bay who isn't a cheese head, so it is unfair to categorize them as such.\\\nAnd doing things such as making socks with pigs in police hats on them is just flat-out wrong and I think it is ridiculous that anyone would do that. I think it's fair to say that per capita, there are just as many racist black people as white people. I think it's foolish to say that the only racist race is whites.\n\nPoint #2: **What they're doing is not the right way to deal with this \"problem\".**\n\nThings like profiling police officers as all being racist and making pig police socks to pigeonhole the police is wrong as well. I think that two wrongs don't make a right and to do that because of so called inequality in a country where no laws exist that discriminate is downright ignorant.\n\nPoint #3: **Racial equality already exists in this country.**\n\nName to me one law, one legislation that discriminates against blacks or any minority for that matter. In fact, most policies in place by employers and colleges look to give minorities a better chance at being enrolled in a college or hired at a job. Just because a group of people was discriminated in the past does not mean things are unequal now.\n\nI appreciate my opponent's acceptance and the opportunity to debate on this topic. Rebuttals next round. Good luck!\n"

Thank you I guess.\n\nI don't care about what's in someone's head as much as what they do. There's not a way to scientifically study something such as implicit bias, so we're swinging at ghosts effectively. Also, implicit bias isn't solid enough to hold up in a court room which is why it's never been used in a courtroom as evidence for any case. I don't care about what people think in their head so much as if they act on it because I'm not a mind reader.\n\nTo your source, how would they know that???It still doesn't explain how the test works, it explains what the test does and how it is administered, but no hint to how it works. Granted I did scan the article, but if you want to explain to me exactly how it works, please do that.\n\nIf there are no laws that are racist, what exactly are you fighting?\n\nNo, I'm not triggered by cartoons on socks, I disagree with how that group of people is handling the situation. To call cops pigs is obviously extremely disrespectful and it's obvious when you look at how Nike is making those socks, that it is because of the Colin Kaepernick movement. I don't need to explain the correlation there.\n\n\"It is a fact that job applicants with black sounding names are less likely to get a response, even with identical resumes. I see nothing wrong with policies that attempt to correct this problem.\"\n\n\"Black sounding names\", that's racist. And maybe that has nothing to do with their race, and more to do with the fact that those names are harder to pronounce. The same reason support people from India make up white washed names so that people don't have to say the \"indian sounding names\". It's not to do with the names, but rather that their names are harder to pronounce, and when dealing with people, you don't want them struggling to say your name.\n"

It provides a clear and relevant illustration of how racial disparities manifest in legal outcomes. In contrast, the Con argument makes a broader claim about preferential treatment without directly addressing the existence of systemic issues or providing evidence to support its assertion. This makes the Pro argument more compelling and focused.",
            "The Pro argument effectively highlights the importance of awareness and activism in addressing biases, suggesting a proactive approach to social issues. In contrast, the Con argument dismisses the significance of unconscious bias without addressing the broader implications of systemic racism, making it less persuasive.",
            "The Pro argument effectively highlights the focus of Kaepernick's activism on systemic issues, which is a more nuanced and impactful perspective. In contrast, the Con argument relies on the notion of financial gain, which may undermine the sincerity of his activism but does not directly address the core issues he aims to highlight.",
            "The Pro argument highlights the prevalence of unconscious bias, which is a significant factor in discussions about systemic issues, including racism. It emphasizes that a large majority of people, including those in positions of authority like police, are affected by these biases, making it a compelling point. The Con argument, while raising a valid concern about measurability and legal action, does not effectively counter the impact of unconscious bias on behavior and decision-making, which weakens its overall persuasiveness.",
            "The Pro argument addresses a systemic issue that affects minority populations, highlighting the significant impact of educational disparities. It presents a clear and relevant social concern. The Con argument, while addressing a valid point about divisive symbols, lacks the same level of urgency and broader societal implications as the Pro argument.",
            "The pro argument effectively highlights the need to address systemic inequities and biases that affect minorities, framing affirmative action as a necessary tool for promoting equality and career growth. In contrast, the con argument, while valid in its concern for meritocracy, lacks a strong acknowledgment of the existing disparities that affirmative action seeks to rectify. It also does not provide a clear alternative solution to address these inequities.",
            "The Pro argument presents clear evidence of a disparity in job responses based on name perception, highlighting a systemic issue that suggests racial bias. In contrast, the Con argument downplays the significance of the issue by attributing it to communication preferences, which can be seen as an attempt to rationalize discriminatory behavior rather than addressing the underlying racism.",
            "The Pro argument highlights the existence of institutional racism and its impact on people of color, which is supported by extensive research and real-world examples. In contrast, the Con argument relies on the absence of explicit discriminatory laws, which overlooks the subtler, systemic issues that can perpetuate inequality even in the absence of overt discrimination. This makes the Pro argument more compelling and relevant to the ongoing discussion about racial equity.",
            "The Pro argument effectively highlights the importance of recognizing systemic issues that lead to racial disparities, emphasizing that intent is not the sole factor in determining racism. In contrast, the Con argument lacks nuance, as it oversimplifies the complexities of racial inequality and does not adequately address the ongoing impacts of historical discrimination.",
            "The Pro argument effectively highlights the focus of Kaepernick's activism on systemic issues rather than individual actions, which is a more nuanced and comprehensive perspective. In contrast, the Con argument relies on a generalization that oversimplifies the movement's message and does not adequately address the broader context of systemic injustice that Kaepernick aims to highlight.",
            "The Pro argument effectively highlights the role of affirmative action in addressing systemic inequities and biases that affect minorities, which is a crucial aspect of the ongoing discussion about equality and opportunity. The Con argument, while raising a valid concern about preferential treatment, does not adequately address the complexities of racial inequality and the historical context that necessitates affirmative action. It lacks a strong connection to the real-world implications of systemic barriers faced by minorities.",
            "The Pro argument clearly articulates the purpose of the movement, focusing on the specific issue of systematic oppression within the criminal justice system. In contrast, the Con argument seems to undermine the movement by generalizing its claims and introducing a counterpoint that lacks depth. It does not effectively address the core issues raised by the Pro argument, making it less persuasive overall.",
            "The Pro argument directly addresses a specific issue\u2014unconscious bias in police interactions with African Americans\u2014highlighting a systemic problem that can lead to negative outcomes. In contrast, the Con argument, while valid in acknowledging that not all police are racist, does not effectively counter the specific claim about the impact of unconscious bias. It lacks a direct engagement with the consequences of bias, making it less persuasive in this context.",
            "The Pro argument highlights the significance of criminal justice reform and the personal sacrifices made by players, which adds emotional weight and urgency to the issue. In contrast, the Con argument focuses on a specific action that may be divisive but does not effectively counter the broader importance of the movement for reform. The Pro argument is more compelling as it emphasizes the necessity of addressing systemic issues rather than critiquing individual actions.",
            "The Pro argument highlights the reality that discrimination can persist even in the absence of discriminatory laws, emphasizing the importance of addressing societal attitudes and behaviors. The Con argument, while pointing out the lack of explicit discriminatory laws, fails to acknowledge the systemic and implicit forms of discrimination that can still exist, making it less persuasive in addressing the broader issue of racial equality.",
            "The Pro argument effectively highlights the subtlety of systemic racism, emphasizing that laws can have discriminatory effects even without explicit racial language. This perspective is crucial in understanding the broader implications of legislation on marginalized communities. The Con argument, while addressing a valid concern about preferential treatment, does not directly engage with the complexities of existing racial inequalities and may oversimplify the issue."

                "content": "Just to clarify my position, I believe abortions should only be allowed if it's within the first 5 months of pregnancy, or if the mother became pregnant outside of the mothers controls IE rape, condom breaks, birth control fails. Also, religious arguments will not be accepted as most religious arguments are very arbitrary and irrelevant.\n\n- Abortion is not killing if it's done within the first 5 months of pregnancy as in the first 5 months, according to **sciencemag.org**, the fetus isn't even sentient nor has any levels of intelligence. Therefore why should you care about a being that doesn't experience pain nor has a consciousness? If your counter-argument is that at that point in development the fetus has a potential to be alive then you should be against masturbation or women not getting their ovulated eggs fertilized, or perhaps the unintentional killing of non sentient micro bacterial, Which in and of itself is utterly ridiculous.\n\n- Abortion can also be justified if the mother was raped or if a condom breaks. While these events are rare, They still happen and denying an abortion in these scenarios are unfair and possibly deadly if the women are underage. Forcing possibly a young girl to undergo a painful pregnancy which could scar her for life with disorders after just experiencing a traumatized rape is purely disgusting. Especially when more likely than not the girl in questions life will be ruined from having to take care of the baby, or the costly amount it is to raise the baby.\n\n- One of the biggest counter-arguments is that \" Well if you don't want to risk having a baby, don't have sex,\". I am convinced the majority of people who make these arguments have never come close to sex before as this is grossly inaccurate. By this logic we shouldn't have a police force as \" Well if you don't want to be murdered, don't go outside,\" or perhaps people shouldn't swim since \" well if you don't want to drown, don't swim\". This logic is very arbitrary and ignorant. Besides abstinence, only education has proven itself to be rather ineffective as the sad reality is teenagers and adults are going to have sex for pleasure regardless. Abortions would in turn act as a safety net for the unfortunate people who got pregnant if a condom broke or birth control failed.\n\n- Case and point, Abortions are justifiable in certain scenarios and therefore should be legal in those situations whether it be the women were raped, If the mother would die in the baby's birth, Or if it's within the first 5 months when the fetus isn't sentient.\n\nSources,\n\n<https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/04/when-does-your-baby-become-conscious>\n"

A lot of pro-choice people are pro-life, but simply don't see the nonsentient fetus as a life.\n\n\" _Babies are born without full consciousness \"_\n\n_- Consciousness isn't the only trait a being with sentience has, more importantly, a fetus after 5 months feels pain and well being. Consciousness is important, however, feeling pain and well being is even more important._\n\n_\" At no point could he/she be considered just a blob of cells, unless humans themselves have no inherent value. \"_\n\n_- Humans do have value for several different traits that human and life in general possess. Intelligence and more important sentience is the most important trait that a human possesses. Without consciousness, or more importantly the ability too feel pain and well being, the harder it becomes to justify the existence of an organism. This is the same reason why we don't value micro bacteria, as micro bacteria has no intelligence and no sentient, this is why as a society we've come to the conclusion that micro bacteria cells aren't worth saving._\n\n\" Abstinence is a reasonable method of countering pregnancy\"\n\n- The reality of the situation is that while abstinence is the only 100 % guarantee for not having an unwanted pregnancy, it is unrealistic. Even the most well behaved of men succumb to the primal urges to have sex for pleasure, this is why abortion should be legal too act as a safety net. For example, not going outside is almost a 100 % guarantee too not get hurt, however, the reality is that going outside is apart of human nature, which is why we have hospitals and a police force to reduce the likelihood of people getting hurt. Another example would be swimming, simply not swimming is a 100 % guarantee not too drown, however, the reality is many humans love to swim and may get the urge to swim. This is why we have trained lifeguards to reduce the number of people who drown. Case and point we need a safety net to prevent unwanted pregnancies, 5 months is more than enough time for a mother to catch the pregnancy and make a decision.\n\n\" \\_Abortion does not become a moral solution when rape comes into the picture. It's still abortion, and still carries the same implications.\"\n\n- So you would rather see a young girl be raped and be forced to give birth to a fetus which may or may not damage her physically and mentally than to see an organism that most likely isn't sentient yet to be terminated? I and many other people would rather see a non-sentient being suffer than see a sentient being suffer and possibly die.\\_\\\n  _\" Abortion is not necessary or as effective as alternative birth methods such as c-section and vacuum extraction.\"_\n\n_- C-sections are certainly not good for the well being of the mother as there are many side effects, according to **tommys.org**, c-section side effects include,_ heart attacks, problems getting pregnant in the future, problems in future pregnancies, such as [low-lying placenta](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-complications/low-lying-placenta-placenta-praevia), [placenta accreta](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/im-pregnant/pregnancy-news-and-blogs/placenta-accreta-explained), [miscarriage](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-complications/pregnancy-loss/miscarriage-information-and-support) and [stillbirth](https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/pregnancy-complications/pregnancy-loss/stillbirth-information-and-support), and to the baby may cause breathing problems or a higher risk of admission to the neonatal unit.\n\n- Vacuum extractions are also very inconvenient to the mothers well being as well, aside from the possible side effects for the baby, vacuum extractions still hurt the mother, and still involves the mother inconveniently carrying the baby for 9 months.\n\nSOURCES:\n\n<https://www.tommys.org/pregnancy-information/labour-birth/caesarean-section/c-section-benefits-and-risks>\n"

Carrying the baby and giving birth also can cause many different mental and physical issues. For example, my boyfriend's mother giving birth to 3 children directly caused depression for her and caused her to have weight issues. My mother grew several different food allergies from having me. These aren't just random coincidences, it is backed up by science. According to **pregnancybirthbaby.org**, several different mental issues can arise from giving birth including depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. According to another article by **womenshealth.org**, pregnancy normally causes anemia, gestational diabetes, placental abruption, headaches, blurred vision, vaginal bleeding, and also depression. And once again after the birth we come into the issue of the baby taking a great deal of time and money to raise. Very plainly forcing a possible rape victim to go through such trauma's after just being raped, is repulsive.\n\n\" Right, but it's dangerous to take such an incredibly marginal case and assume it bears any relevance to the majority.

You still have not provided me with a trait that a fetus has that justifies its existence aside from it existing. But again just because it exists, doesn't mean it should have moral value. Again if you want to use an appeal to existence, then you have to be against people killing ants and other non-sentient bugs, people killing micro bacteria, and men masturbating which in turn kills sperm.\n\nCase and point, you still have not provided acquit reasons as to why we should value a being which isn't sentient nor intelligent in any way.\n\nSOURCES,\n\n<https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/youre-pregnant-now-what/pregnancy-complications>\n\n<https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/mental-wellbeing-during-pregnancy>\n\n<https://www.womenonweb.org/en/page/6907/complications-of-medical-abortion>\n"

If the police were\n> simply a safety net, they would love for people to break the law,\n> probably even encourage it.\n\nFirst of all, cops whether as a safety net or preventive measure or not, don't activily enjoy people breaking the law. Many have families and friends who would be devastated if the cop died. Secondly, preventive measure is not what cops are, they are a safety net. Preventive measures would be a measure you took to not get murdered or robbed. This could include locking doors, buying a security system, or maybe not walking down the dark scary alleyway. A safety net would be something that when the preventive measures fail and someone is in trouble, the safety net would essentially save that person. In this case, it would the the police force as at this point the preventive measures of home security and common sense have failed and due to this, the safety net/police force would save the person.\n\n> Also, psychological trauma (which is real pain) is linked to abortion\n> and miscarriage at a higher rate than birth, so this point simply\n> doesn't hold.\n\nDespite the fact that your source isn't from a medical professional and looks to be from a bias source, it is a 100 % guarantee that raising a child costs a great deal of time and money to raise. We can debate the psychological issues a mother may obtain from pregnancy or abortion all we like, but the fact of the matter is that raising a child is not something every women or teenage girl can do.\n\n> If you want to prove something should be legal, you have to prove many\n> things. Namely, that there's actually a reason for it to be legal.\n\nI have already provided several reasons as to why it should be legal, namely in the cases of the mother becoming pregnant outside of the mothers control IE broken condoms, rape ETC, and if the abortion is performed during the first 5 months when the fetus isn't sentient nor intelligent. All acts by default are legal until proven to be illegal. For example, I don't have to prove why walking around in sandals should be legal, you have to prove to me why it shouldn't be illegal. Regardless I have already proven as to why abortion should be legal, you have still yet to give me good enough reasons to believe it should be illegal.\n\n> Every action can't be morally neutral, it's simply not possible.\n\nThis is a straw-man argument, I NEVER said that all actions are morally neutral, I specifically states that all actions are morally neutral by DEFAULT.\n\n> It's the mother's fault for valuing her child. This is incredibly wrong, from a biological standpoint and a moral one.\n\nIn the context of this scenario, the fetus is not alive yet as it is not sentient nor intelligent which is proven by biology and science. If the mother values a non-sentient nor intelligent being, this is not abortions fault this is the fault of society, and the mother. Besides if the mother doesn't want to have an abortion, we aren't going to force her to have one. If a rape victim wants to carry the fetus anyways and have the child, that is purely her choice. There are many women who would be happier without having the baby however.\n\n> From a sociological perspective alone abortions cost outweighs the benefit.\n\nLets examine the costs, the costs of abortion are the mother possibly might experience trauma and depression. The benefits are most likely the mother does not have to go through physical pain of carrying the baby or giving birth, the mother saves a great deal of time and money from not raising the baby, and the assuming their are birth complications that may put the mother at risk the mother's life would be saved.\n"

I don't think such a complex topic is solvable within 5 written rounds, and given the option I would happily discuss this over a microphone.\n\n> \"This would be an appeal to potentiality which is not a very good basis to measure life on. If you think life is just simply based on potentiality\"\n>\n> \"Since you are framing your entire argument on potentiality and existence, than again what makes a human different than a bug in your logic. In my logic, humans\\\n> matter more as they are sentient and intelligent. \"\n\nWhat do you think value itself is? Your intelligence argument is based upon the same potentiality as my own, the only difference is I'm applying it directly and consistently.\n\n> \"Before I begin, I am NOT justifying the genocide of people or babies. Well ecosystems can directly impact humans, mostly in rural areas. For example if an entire population of ants dissipated from an area, the local bug pesticide company may go out of business. If the local foxes or deer become an endangered species, than the local hunters will be forced to find other animals to kill or may go out of business. The point is that ecosystems can impact human civilization. \"\n\nBy definition that's exactly what large-scale abortion is. I also never claimed ecosystems couldn't impact humans. The potential of an ant, or that of a microbe is incredibly less than that of a human baby.\n\n> \"OK I'm sorry I think I asked the wrong question, what gives life it's value than? Since you don't care about sentient nor intelligence, and existence wouldn't make you logical consistent and is very arbitrary, please explain to me the value that life has. \"\n\nThe question of value is a question of potential and purpose. You seemed to have confined potential to intelligence and sentience while completely avoiding the more important question.\n\n> \"First of all, cops whether as a safety net or preventive measure or not, don't activily enjoy people breaking the law.\"\n\nI agree, and I never said they did enjoy such a thing. I said in the hypothetical circumstance they were a safety net they would allow crimes to happen, the objective wouldn't be to stop someone from committing a crime.\n\n> \"Despite the fact that your source isn't from a medical professional and looks to be from a bias source\"\n\nExcept it's a systematic review published by a certified gynecologist and a man with a PhD in bioethics.\n\n> \"Regardless I have already proven as to why abortion should be legal, you have still yet to give me good enough reasons to believe it should be illegal. \"\n\nI have provided many reasons for it to be illegal. A few examples of my 'reasons': harm to the mother, harm to the baby, harm to our future, etc.\n\n> \"In the context of this scenario, the fetus is not alive yet as it is not sentient nor intelligent which is proven by biology and science. If the mother values a non-sentient nor intelligent being, this is not abortions fault this is the fault of society, and the mother. \"\n\nActually the fetus is alive and constitutes life, just not necessarily 'sentient' life as you've put it. Women are biologically preconditioned to ascribe emotional value to the child -- logically justified or not, that is the case.\n\n> \"Lets examine the costs, the costs of abortion are the mother possibly might experience trauma and depression. The benefits are most likely the mother does not have to go through physical pain of carrying the baby or giving birth, the mother saves a great deal of time and money from not raising the baby, and the assuming their are birth complications that may put the mother at risk the mother's life would be saved. \"\n\nThe great thing here is that these are not sociological arguments. I'd love for anyone name me a single valid sociological benefit to abortion.\n\n> \"This is a straw-man argument, I NEVER said that all actions are morally neutral, I specifically states that all actions are morally neutral by DEFAULT. \"\n\nI said in no uncertain terms that it is impossible for an action to be morally neutral. That was my point, and if there ever was a clear case of projection this would be it.\n\nIn response to your assertion of strawmanning: I have done no such thing throughout this entire debate. However, if I pointed the finger back at you I don't think you dispute misrepresenting many of my own arguments. After this last round, I'm entirely convinced you didn't argue in good faith.\n"
